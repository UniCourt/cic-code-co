                        Appointment within ambit of constitutional provision. The Colorado constitution allows the supreme court to appoint "such . . . personnel as the court may deem necessary to aid in the administration of the courts". Certainly, the general assembly's determination
                        that the state public defender be appointed by the Colorado supreme court is within the ambit of this constitutional provision. People v. Mullins, 188
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 29
       </cite> , 532 P.2d 736 (1975).

                    <p>
                        And is not violative of due process or separation of powers. The office of the state public defender is not unconstitutional and does not violate the separation of powers doctrine or deny defendants a trial in accord with the due process clause of the
                        state and federal constitutions. Although the state public defender is appointed and his compensation is fixed by the Colorado supreme court, this statutory scheme does not create such a nexus as would violate the due process provisions,
                        the separation of powers doctrine, or the right a defendant has to a fair trial. People v. Mullins, 188
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 29
       </cite> , 532 P.2d 736 (1975).

                    <p>
                        Nor do statutory protections violate separation of powers. The statutory system in Colorado, which protects the public defender's office with certain statutory safeguards, in no way violates the principles of separation of powers or the other guarantees
                        of due process. People v. Mullins, 188
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 29

                        No conflict of interest in private representation of defendant by public defender. Since employment in a public defender's office is not the type of public employment contemplated in Ethical Consideration 9-3 and Disciplinary Rule 9-101(B) of the code

                        guardian, or legal custodian is not required to pay the processing fee. The fee is assessed at the time of sentencing, if sentencing occurs, or upon other final disposition of the case; except that the court may, at sentencing
                        or other final disposition, waive the fee if the court determines, based upon the financial information submitted by the party being represented by the court-appointed counsel, that the person does not have the financial resources

                        under the penalty of perjury. A copy of the application must be sent to the prosecuting attorney for review, and, upon request, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue of the eligibility for appointment of the public defender's
                        office. Processing fees collected pursuant to this subsection (3) are transmitted to the state treasurer, who shall credit the same to the general fund.

                        Appointment of alternate defense counsel by court is valid even if the individual attorney is not "on the official list" established by the office of alternate defense counsel. Nor does the attorney have to be appointed directly by the office of alternate
