                amended in subsequent years and was the subject of a major rewrite in the 2000 session based upon recommendations of the office of the attorney general.

                <p>
                    If a consumer owes an unpaid balance to a creditor with respect to a consumer credit transaction and becomes obligated on another consumer credit transaction with the same creditor, the parties may agree to a consolidation resulting in a single schedule
                    of payments. If the previous consumer credit transaction was not precomputed, the parties may agree to add the unpaid amount of the amount financed and accrued charges on the date of consolidation to the amount financed with respect
                    to the subsequent consumer credit transaction. If the previous consumer credit transaction was precomputed, the parties may agree to refinance the unpaid balance pursuant to the provisions on refinancing contained in section 5-2-205
                    and to consolidate the amount financed resulting from the refinancing by adding it to the amount financed with respect to the subsequent consumer credit transaction. In either case, the creditor may contract for and receive a finance
                    charge based on the aggregate amount financed resulting from the consolidation at a rate not in excess of that permitted by the provisions on finance charges.

                        the provisions of this code. The record-keeping system of a licensee shall be sufficient if the licensee makes the required information reasonably available. The records need not be kept in the place of business where supervised

                        of making the kinds of information required in annual reports uniform among the states. Information contained in annual reports shall be confidential and may be published only in composite form. The administrator may, by rule,

                    reasonably identify the rights assigned is ineffective. If requested by the consumer, the assignee must seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made and unless the assignee does so the consumer may pay the

                    The people of this state find and declare that payday lenders are charging up to two hundred percent annually for payday loans and that excess charges on such loans can lead Colorado families into a debt trap of repeat borrowing. It is the intent of the
                    people to lower the maximum authorized finance charge for payday loans to an annual percentage rate of thirty-six percent.

                    maximum loan term or minimum finance charge. The minimum loan term shall be six months from the loan transaction date. The lender shall accept prepayment from a consumer prior to the loan due date and shall not charge the consumer

                    If you obtain this loan, the lender will have a mortgage in Colorado; this is a deed of trust on your home. You could lose your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet your obligations under the loan. Mortgage loan rates and closing
                    costs and fees vary based on many factors, including your particular credit and financial circumstances, your earnings history, the loan-to-value requested, and the type of property that will secure your loan. The loan rate and fees
                    could vary based on which lender or broker you select. You are not required to complete any loan agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application. If you proceed with this mortgage loan,
                    you should also remember that you may face serious financial risks if you use this loan to pay off credit card debts and other debts in connection with this transaction and then later incur significant new credit card charges or other
                    debts. If you continue to accumulate debt after this loan is closed and then experience financial difficulties, you could lose your home and any equity you have in it if you do not meet your mortgage loan obligations. Property taxes
                    and homeowner's insurance are your responsibility. Not all lenders provide escrow services for these payments. You should ask your lender about these services. Your payments on existing debts contribute to your credit ratings. You
                    should not accept any advice to ignore your regular payments to your existing creditors.

                <p>
                    If a creditor contracts for or receives a separate charge for insurance against loss of or damage to property, the risk of loss or damage not willfully caused by the consumer is on the consumer only to the extent of any deficiency in the effective coverage
                    of the insurance even though the insurance covers only the interest of the creditor.

                        A creditor named as a beneficiary in a policy on the debtor's life is entitled out of the proceeds only to the amount of the actual debt, together with interest. Where the sole purpose to be accomplished in the issuance of an insurance policy upon the
                        life of a debtor is to secure the payment of a debt to the creditor, or where the same single purpose is accomplished by a change in beneficiary, the creditor's right to the proceeds of the policy on the death of a debtor extends
                        no further than indemnity. Under such circumstances all proceeds from the policy beyond the debt owed the creditor plus interest and premiums paid by him, are payable to the legal representatives of the deceased debtor. Forster

                    not engage in the conduct in the future. The assurance may also require the person to make refunds to consumers of excess charges under this code, pay a penalty up to a maximum of one thousand dollars for each violation, all or part

                    With respect to an action brought to enjoin violations of this code under section 5-6-111 or unconscionable agreements or fraudulent or unconscionable conduct under section 5-6-112, the administrator may apply to the court for a temporary restraining
                    order or a preliminary injunction against a respondent pending final determination of proceedings. If the court finds after a hearing that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent is engaging in or is likely to engage
                    in conduct sought to be restrained, it may grant any such temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction it deems appropriate. The court may also issue such orders or judgments as may be necessary to completely compensate or
                    restore to his or her original position any consumer affected by such violation, agreement, or conduct or if there is reasonable cause to believe funds to make refunds of excess charges under this code will not be available at a future
                    date. No bond or other security is required of the administrator before relief under this section may be granted.

                        licenses for those in the lenders' possession, but this is entirely a ministerial act.

                                In historical perspective. The exaction or taking of interest or compensation for the use of money was regarded as usurious, whether moderate or excessive, both in biblical times and by the early common law prior to the reign of Henry VIII. It seems to
                                have been held by the church that the taking of interest was actually sinful as against the laws of God and morality and by the courts that it was unlawful on the theory of the classical and medieval economists from the
                                time of Aristotle that money was only a medium of exchange and naturally barren and unproductive. By the 16th century the gap between religious theory and commercial practice had been further narrowed, and the new protestant
                                ethics regarded only excessive exactions as usury. In the United States, the courts have always viewed the allowance of interest with greater favor than have the courts in England. The English common law has never been
                                suited to the conditions existing in this country, and the American courts have never doubted the right to interest where it has been expressly contracted for, or where an undertaking to pay interest may be implied from

          The subject of interest is governed by statute,
         </b> and in no case where interest is not so provided is it recoverable, unless specially contracted for, except in the nature of damages, where a refusal to pay has been wilful, wrongful, fraudulent, or without
                                reasonable cause. Since this section points out in detail and especially enumerates the cases in which interest is allowable, assuming to cover the whole field, it is not recoverable in any case not thus expressly enumerated,
                                or included by fair implication. When the general assembly assumed to declare in what cases interest could be allowed, under the rule that the expression of the one is the exclusion of another, no interest can be allowed

                            Since the law seeks to indemnify the plaintiff for the loss he has suffered by the breach of contract, the rate fixed by the parties affords a just rule of indemnity. If, however, the rate of interest specified in the contract
                            greatly exceeds the real value of the money, it is a penalty for the nonpayment of the principal sum, rather than a just recompense for detaining it, and will not be allowed. Browne v. Steck, 2 Colo. 70 (1873).

         An appealing judgment debtor must pay post-judgment interest when the appeal is affirmed and the funds are inaccessible to the creditor;
        </b> further, there is no requirement that interest must be specifically requested. This section makes no exception for attorney fees; post-judgment interest on attorney fees is required when the judgment is affirmed
                            on appeal. Furthermore, it is of no import whether the judgment award for attorney fees is made directly to the attorney or to the party. In re Gutfreund, 148 P.3d 136 (Colo. 2006).

         While the statute does not define "satisfaction", a party satisfies a debt
        </b> when the creditor has been paid and the debtor is no longer obligated to pay that portion of the amount due. Thus, if debtor deposits the funds in a court registry, the judgment is not satisfied until the funds
                            are accessible to the creditor, and only at that point does the obligation to pay interest terminate. In re Gutfreund, 148 P.3d 136 (Colo. 2006).

                            Notice of validation was contradicted or overshadowed when the debt collector sent a second notice with the statement "we cannot help you unless you call" in capitalized and bolded font that was larger than the rest of the notice. Because this statement
                            was capable of being reasonably interpreted by the least sophisticated consumer as changing the manner in which the consumer was required by law to dispute the debt or its amount, it was, as a matter of law, deceptive or misleading.

                <p>
                    The general assembly finds and declares that the use of consumer reporting agencies is increasing rapidly as consumer credit transactions become the rule rather than the exception in every-day consumer purchasing. Consumer credit reports by consumer reporting
                    agencies may report on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, debts, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living as factors to establish a consumer's eligibility for credit
                    insurance or employment. When a consumer reporting agency undertakes a business that has the potential to profoundly affect an individual consumer's life, whether for good or ill, it is incumbent upon such agencies to ensure that the
                    information they are providing is accurate. Inaccurate consumer credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence in the banking system. There is
                    a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumer's rights. The general assembly further finds and declares that, in the event the information
                    provided by a consumer reporting agency in a consumer credit report is inaccurate, the consumer has the right to have that information corrected in a swift and uncomplicated way.

                <p>
                    You may obtain a security freeze on your consumer report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge, except as provided by law. You have a right to place a security freeze on your consumer report
                    to prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your consumer report without your express authorization or approval, except as the law allows. You will not be initially charged to place a security freeze on
                    your consumer report. However, you will be charged a fee of no more than ten dollars to temporarily lift the freeze for a period of time, to permanently remove the freeze from your consumer report, or when you make a subsequent request
                    for a freeze to be placed on your consumer report. As well, you may be charged a fee of no more than twelve dollars to temporarily lift the freeze for a specific party. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and
                    services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your consumer report, within five business days you will be provided procedures for the temporary release of your consumer report to
                    a specific party or parties or for a period of time after the security freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide the proper information regarding the third party or
                    parties who are to receive the consumer report or the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the consumer report. A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a
                    security freeze on a consumer report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request. A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an existing account relationship, and
                    a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities. You should be aware that using a security freeze to take
                    control over who gains access to the personal and financial information in your consumer report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding new loans, credit,
                    mortgage, insurance, government services or payments, rental housing, employment, investment, license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, internet credit card transaction, or other services, including an extension of credit
                    at the point of sale. You should plan ahead and lift a security freeze either completely if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor a few days before actually applying for new credit. You have the right to bring
                    a civil action or submit to binding arbitration against a consumer reporting agency to enforce an obligation under the security freeze law after following specified dispute procedures and having received the necessary notice.

       RIGHTS UNDER COLORADO
       AND FEDERAL LAW
      </b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau at no charge once per year with additional copies available for a small fee. You have a right to dispute inaccurate information by contacting the credit bureau directly. However,
                    you have no right to have accurate information removed from your credit bureau report. Under the federal "Fair Credit Reporting Act", the credit bureau must remove accurate negative information from your report only if it is over 7
                    years old. Bankruptcy can be reported for 10 years. Even when a debt has been completely repaid, your report can show that it was paid late if that is accurate. You have a right to sue a credit repair company that violates the "Colorado
                    Credit Services Organization Act". This law prohibits deceptive practices by repair companies. The "Colorado Credit Services Organization Act" also gives you a right to cancel your contract for any reason within 5 working days from
                    the date you sign it. The Federal Trade Commission enforces the federal "Fair Credit Reporting Act". For more information, call or write the Federal Trade Commission. The administrator of the "Uniform Consumer Credit Code" enforces
                    the "Colorado Credit Services Organization Act". For more information, call or write the Colorado attorney general's office.

        The Uniform Debt-Management Services Act does not violate the separation of powers doctrine of the Colorado constitution by regulating attorneys.
       </b> Limited regulation of attorneys under the Act does not implicate the Colorado supreme court's regulatory authority over bar admission, discipline, or license revocation of attorneys. Coffman v. Williamson, 2015 CO 35,

        The Act does not violate the commerce clause or the privileges and immunities clause of the United States constitution with respect to regulating out-of-state attorneys because the Act is facially neutral and any burden on out-of-state attorneys is incidental.
       </b> Out-of-state attorneys can still conduct debt-management services in Colorado, provided they comply with the Act or fall within the legal services exemption by associating with a local attorney and satisfying pro hac
                        vice requirements to appear before a court. Coffman v. Williamson, 2015 CO 35, 348 P.3d 929.

        The Act's exemptions from regulation should be applied narrowly because the Act was enacted to protect consumers and is remedial in nature.

        The legal services exemption only extends to a nonlawyer assistant if the nonlawyer assistant works for the attorney providing debt-management services.
       </b> A nationwide legal software company owned and operated by nonlawyers that contracted with lawyers to provide debt-management services did not fall within the legal services exemption because the legal software company
                        did not act on behalf of the lawyers in the provision of debt-management services; rather, the lawyers acted on behalf of the legal software company. Coffman v. Williamson, 2015 CO 35, 348 P.3d 929.

                    extended for a period of one year if the plaintiff proves that failure to timely commence the action was caused by the defendant engaging in conduct calculated to induce the plaintiff to refrain from or postpone the commencement of
