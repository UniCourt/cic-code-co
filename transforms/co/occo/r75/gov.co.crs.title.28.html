The appraised value of such real estate shall be determined by an appraiser who is licensed or certificated pursuant to part 6 of article 10 of title 12 and who is selected by the adjutant general from a list of three qualified individuals submitted to the adjutant general by the department. Appraisers shall be selected for the list, and their fees shall be negotiated in accordance with the standards established by part 14 of article 30 of title 24. The adjutant general, by and with the advice and approval of the governor, is authorized to lease any property belonging to the department when it is not needed for the immediate use of the department. All conveyances that are required for the purpose of this section shall be executed by the governor under the seal of the state, and the proceeds of all sales, trades, or other disposition shall be placed in an account to be invested by the state treasurer as provided in section  24-36-113. Any interest earned on the investment or deposit of such proceeds shall remain in such account and shall not be credited to the general fund or any other fund of the state. Said proceeds and any interest thereon shall be disbursed by authority of the adjutant general, subject to appropriation by the general assembly, only for the construction, repair, improvement, acquisition, or costs of acquisition or sale of armories throughout the state. Costs of acquisition or sale shall include but need not be limited to appraisals, site surveys, environmental surveys, title work, property inspections, closing costs, legal fees, real estate fees, site preparation, or utility studies. Prior to disposing of any real property pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (1)(s), the adjutant general shall submit a report to the capital development committee that describes such real property, the maintenance costs related to such real property, the current value of such real property, any conditions or limitations that may restrict the use of such real property, and the terms of the proposed disposition of such real property. The capital development committee shall review any such report that is submitted to the capital development committee and shall provide recommendations to the adjutant general concerning the proposed real property disposition within thirty days after the date of receipt of such report. The adjutant general shall not complete any such real property disposition without considering any recommendations of the capital development committee that are provided within such thirty-day period.

           The adjutant general may dispose of real estate acquired but unsuitable for military purposes for less than its appraised value when the disposition is to an agency of state government.

In the event an offer has been made to purchase such real estate for more than its appraised value, prior to any disposition the adjutant general shall give due consideration to the terms of the offer and to any cost savings to the state which would result from a transfer of such real estate to a state agency.

     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this article or by federal law, original enlistments in the military forces shall be for a period of three years and subsequent enlistments for a period of one or three years. The governor may by order fix shorter periods of enlistment or reenlistment for any of the military forces so far as not inconsistent with federal law. In the event of any emergency wherein the governor has called out any of the military forces, he or she may by order extend, for not exceeding the period of emergency and sixty days thereafter, the period of any enlistment in the forces called out which would otherwise expire.

     Legislative declaration
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, due to the many mobilizations subsequent to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many families of Colorado National Guard members and reservists face financial hardships when the National Guard member or reservist is called to active military duty or state active duty because the military pay of a soldier is often far less than his or her civilian salary. Because private companies often do not make up the difference in salary, military families may see a significant drop in household income while a family member is away on active military duty or state active duty. In addition, active duty military personnel and their families encounter additional hardships when the active duty member is deployed to zones in which he or she will encounter hostile fire. Many families of Colorado National Guard members, reservists, and active duty military personnel also face additional expenses caused by a long family separation. The general assembly further finds and declares that grants from the military family relief fund are intended to help families defray the costs of food, housing, utilities, medical services, and other expenses that may be difficult to afford when a family member leaves civilian employment for active military duty, is on active military duty in a hostile fire zone, or is called to state active duty by executive order of the governor.

If the charges are forwarded after the investigation, they shall be accompanied by a statement of the substance of the testimony taken on both sides, and a copy thereof shall be given to the accused.

A demand for further investigation entitles the accused to recall witnesses for further cross-examination and to offer any new evidence in his or her own behalf.

     Classification of offenses
     </h3>
     <p>
      A conviction by general court-martial of any military offense for which an accused received a sentence greater than one year of confinement or a conviction by a general court-martial of any offense that, at the time the offense was committed, carries a maximum term of confinement of three years or greater as set forth under 10 U.S.C. sec. 877 to 10 U.S.C. sec. 934, as amended, or pursuant to an executive order, is a felony offense. Except for convictions by a summary court-martial, all other military offenses are misdemeanors. Any conviction by a special court-martial is a misdemeanor. Any conviction by a summary court-martial is not a criminal conviction.

       Governor’s declaration that a state of insurrection exists is conclusive

      </p>
      <p>
       Militia may arrest and imprison participants.
       Where the governor has declared an insurrection to exist, the militia has authority to arrest and imprison any person participating in or aiding and abetting such insurrection and to detain such person in custody until the insurrection is suppressed. In re Moyer, 35
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 159

       , 85 P. 190 (1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       If arrests are made in good faith, governor is not liable.
       So long as arrests of those whom the governor considers to stand in the way of restoring peace are made in good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an action after he is out of office on the ground that he has not reasonable ground for his belief. Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 29 S. Ct. 235, 53 L. Ed. 410 (1909).

     Redress of injuries to property
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t28-military-ar3.1-p06-s28-3.1-605ol11">
       Whenever complaint is made to any commanding officer that willful damage has been done to the property of any person or that his or her property has been wrongfully taken by members of the state military forces, said commanding officer may, subject to such regulations as the governor may prescribe, convene a board to investigate the complaint. The board shall consist of one to three commissioned officers and, for the purpose of that investigation, the board has power to summon witnesses and examine them under oath, to receive depositions or other documentary evidence, and to assess the damages sustained against the responsible parties. The assessment of damages made by the board is subject to the approval of the commanding officer and, in the amount approved by the commanding officer, shall be charged against the pay of the offenders. The order of the commanding officer directing such charges is conclusive on any disbursing officer for the payment by him or her to the injured parties of the damages so assessed and approved.
      </li>
      <li id="t28-military-ar3.1-p06-s28-3.1-605ol12">
       If the offenders cannot be ascertained, but the organization or detachment to which they belong is known, charges totaling the amount of damages assessed and approved may be made in such proportion as may be considered just upon the individual members thereof who are shown to have been present at the scene at the time the damages complained of were inflicted, as determined by the approved findings of the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t28-military-ar3.1-p06-s28-3.1-605ol13">
       Any person subject to this code who is accused of causing willful damage to property has the right to be represented by counsel, to summon witnesses in his or her behalf, and to cross-examine those appearing against him or her.

     Compensation of guardians
     </h3>
     <p>
      Compensation payable to guardians shall be based upon services rendered and shall not exceed five percent of the amount of income received during the period covered by the account; except that such percentage compensation shall not be allowed on the moneys or other assets received from a prior guardian nor upon the amount received from liquidation of loans or other investments. In the event five percent of income received during the period would be less than twenty-five dollars and the personal property in the estate totals not more than one thousand five hundred dollars, twenty-five dollars may be taken as the guardian’s compensation. If the personal property in the estate exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars and five percent of the income would be less than fifty dollars, the guardian’s compensation may be fifty dollars. In any case in which the compensation under the foregoing appropriate rates is inadequate because of extra services performed, the court, upon petition and hearing thereon, may authorize reasonable additional compensation. A copy of the petition and notice of hearing thereon shall be given the proper office of the veterans administration in the manner provided in the case of hearing on a guardian’s account or other pleading.

     Certification or commitment to veterans administration
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t28-veterans-ar05-p02-s28-5-220ol11">
       When, in any proceeding under the laws of this state for the commitment or certification of a person alleged to have a mental health disorder or otherwise be in need of confinement in a hospital or other institution for his or her proper care, it is determined after such adjudication of the status of such person as may be required by law that commitment or certification to a hospital for treatment of mental health disorders or other institution is necessary for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that the person is eligible for care or treatment by the veterans administration, the court, upon receipt of a certificate from the veterans administration showing that facilities are available and that the person is eligible for care or treatment therein, may commit or certify the person to the veterans administration. Upon commitment or certification, the person, when admitted to any facility operated by such agency within or without this state, is subject to the rules and regulations of the veterans administration. The chief officer of any facility of the veterans administration to which the person is committed or certified, with respect to the person committed or certified, is vested with the same powers as superintendents of state hospitals for mental health disorders within this state with respect to retention of custody, transfer, parole, or discharge as restored to reason.
      </li>
      <li id="t28-veterans-ar05-p02-s28-5-220ol12">
       The judgment or order of certification or commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state or of the District of Columbia certifying or committing a person to the veterans administration for care or treatment has the same force and effect as to the person while in this state as in the jurisdiction in which the court entering the judgment or making the order is situated; and the courts of the certifying or committing state or of the District of Columbia are deemed to have retained jurisdiction of the person so certified or committed for the purpose of inquiring into the person’s mental health and of determining the necessity for continuance of his or her restraint. Consent is given to the application of the law of the certifying or committing state or district in respect to the authority of the chief officer of any facility of the veterans administration to retain custody or transfer, parole, or discharge the person.
      </li>
      <li id="t28-veterans-ar05-p02-s28-5-220ol13">
       Upon receipt of a certificate of the veterans administration that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any person committed or certified to any hospital for persons with mental health disorders or other institution for the care or treatment of persons similarly afflicted and that the person is eligible for care or treatment, the court having jurisdiction may cause him or her to be transferred to the veterans administration for care or treatment. Any person transferred as provided in this section is deemed to be committed or certified to the veterans administration for all purposes as provided in subsection (1) of this section as on original commitment or certification.
