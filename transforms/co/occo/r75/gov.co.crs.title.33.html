       Law reviews.
       For note, “Are Colorado Game Preserve Laws Local Legislation?”, see 1 Rocky Mt. L. Rev. 136.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ownership of wild game is in state for use of all people,
       and the exercise of police power to protect game for the benefit of its citizens is not only the right, but the duty of the state. Maitland v. People, 93
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 59
       </cite>
       , 23 P.2d 116 (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       But state not liable for crop damage by wild geese.
       Landowners unquestionably possess cognizable property interest in their crops and residues but it does not follow that mere state ownership of wild game exposes it to liability for crop losses caused by wild geese. Collopy v. Wildlife Comm’n, 625 P.2d 994 (Colo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to hunt wild game upon one’s own land is not property right enforceable against state
       under § 15 of art. II,
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. Const.Collopy v. Wildlife Comm’n, 625 P.2d 994
       </cite>
       (Colo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission authorized to close hunting season.
       There is no doubt that the wildlife commission possesses the statutory authority to close the hunting season on a species of game in a specific locality to assure maintenance of an adequate supply, and to protect and enhance the game population for the use, benefit, and enjoyment of residents and visitors; these objectives are with the purview of the state’s police power. Collopy v. Wildlife Comm’n, 625 P.2d 994 (Colo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to capture or kill exists only as permitted by statute.
       The statutes of Colorado vest the ownership of game in the state as a proprietor, and take away the “right to capture and kill unless prohibited” as it existed at common law, leaving under these statutes no right to capture and kill, except as permitted. Hornbeke v. White, 20 Colo. App. 13, 76 P. 926 (1904); Hartman v. Tresise, 36
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 146
       </cite>
       , 84 P. 685, 4 L.R.A. (n.s.) 872 (1906) concurring opinion; People v. Johnson, 38
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 78

       There was ample evidence to support the trial court’s finding that defendant’s animals were “nonnative wildlife” or “exotic wildlife”
       and were subject to the rules of the division of wildlife. The determination of the trial court regarding the red deer, Barbary sheep, ibex goats, and hybrids thereof owned by the defendants will not be disturbed on review.

Notice of such request for proposals shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the commission plans to purchase the real property or interest in water.

Bidders shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals. The commission, or its designee, shall not disclose any information regarding the offering prices of other proposals during the course of such discussions.

Specifically, the commission shall have power to adopt rules or regulations upon the following matters:

      The state of Colorado through the division assents to the provisions of the act of congress entitled “An Act to provide that the United States shall aid the states in wildlife restoration projects, and for other purposes.”, approved September 2, 1937, and as amended. The division is authorized to perform such acts as may be necessary to conduct and establish cooperative wildlife restoration projects, as defined in such act, in compliance with such act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the secretary of the interior thereunder. No moneys or funds accruing to the division pursuant to such act shall be used for any purpose other than for such projects and the administration of the division, but the division may pay into the general fund as a part of its administrative costs a reasonable rental or service charge, as it may determine, for office quarters and auditing, bookkeeping, and like services furnished to the division by the state. All moneys now in the wildlife cash fund, or accrued or accruing to or received or receivable by the division, pursuant to such act shall be appropriated to pay for the administrative expense of such division for the protection, preservation, restoration, and control of wildlife of the state and to cover expenses in enforcing the wildlife laws of the state.

      <p>
       This section complies with the requirements of the federal Pittman-Robertson act.
       The plain language of the statute requires the department of wildlife to act in compliance with the Pittman-Robertson act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the secretary of interior under the act. Therefore, this section incorporates by reference all statutory and regulatory requirements of the Pittman-Robertson act. To require Colorado to include all possible violations of the act and its supporting rules and regulations would encourage “legislative loopholes”. Sportsmen’s Wildlife Def. Fund v. Romer, 29 F.

       “Management” means the collection and application of biological information for the purposes of increasing the number of individuals within species and populations of wildlife up to the optimum carrying capacity of their habitat and maintaining such levels. The term includes the entire range of activities that constitute a modern, scientific resource program including, but not limited to, research, census, law enforcement, habitat acquisition and improvement, and education. Also included within the term, when and where appropriate, is the periodic or total protection of species or populations. “Management” may include artificial propagation to maintain threatened or endangered species populations, in concert with the exercise of water rights, and may also include restriction of stocking of species which are in competition with threatened or endangered species for the available habitat.

The introduction of wildlife species also has far-reaching impacts on benefits from the use of both public and private lands within the state.

Such waiver shall be in writing and shall be mailed to the commission within ten days after such claimant receives notification from the division of the denial of his claim, or within ten days after the claimant receives from the division an offer of settlement unacceptable to such claimant.

       The director may designate sole proprietors, partnerships, or corporations as license agents to sell hunting, fishing, trapping, and other licenses of the division. License agents shall be paid a commission, in an amount to be determined by rule by the commission, on all moneys collected for licenses sold. All agents authorized to sell licenses shall keep accurate records of all sales of licenses and shall make such reports to the division regarding license sales as may be required by the division. Such agents shall be required to give evidence of financial responsibility, in the form of a savings account, deposit, or certificate of deposit meeting the requirements of section  11-35-101, C.R.S., or an irrevocable letter of credit meeting the requirements of section  .5, C.R.S., or a bond, in such amount as may be fixed by the division based upon performance criteria established by the wildlife commission by rule, which may be less than the full value of consignment in an amount adequate to ensure the remittance of all moneys collected from such license sales, less amounts allowed as commissions, and the making of reports required by the division. The commission may promulgate rules for the establishment and cancellation of license agencies. All license moneys received shall be kept separate and apart from any other moneys of the agent authorized to sell licenses and shall at all times belong to the state. All moneys due from the sale of wildlife licenses shall belong to the state and shall draw interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from the date due.

      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol12">
       The executive director, state auditor, and attorney general, or their duly designated representatives, shall constitute a board of claims for the hearing of all claims for relief when any license agent is unable to account for licenses and claims that the same have been destroyed, lost, or stolen. The findings of the board of claims are subject to review pursuant to section  24-4-106, C.R.S. Claims for relief in an amount totaling three hundred dollars or less shall not be determined by the board of claims, except as otherwise provided in this section, but shall be settled by the division. If the division offers to make settlement and such settlement is not accepted by the claimant, the claimant may submit his claim to the board of claims.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol13">
       Every agent designated to sell licenses shall account for all licenses delivered to such agent. If any license agent is not able to account for any license, such agent shall be responsible for the maximum fee for which each unaccounted-for license could have been issued, except as provided in subsections (4) to (8) of this section.

      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol14">
       Any agent designated to sell licenses may make a claim under oath for relief from responsibility for licenses which have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and for which such agent is unable to account, but no claim for relief shall be considered unless the agent making the claim informs the division of such loss, theft, or destruction within thirty days after such loss, theft, or destruction is discovered, said notice to set forth in detail all pertinent information then known to the agent. Upon receipt of any claim for relief, it is the duty of the division to make an investigation of the claim as soon as practicable, and for that purpose the claimant shall make available such records, information, or other pertinent data as may be in his possession or under his control. A written report of such investigation shall be filed by the division with the board of claims.
      </li>

       As soon as practicable after receipt of the investigator’s report and in no event later than one hundred twenty days after receipt of notice of a claim for relief, the board of claims shall set a date for the hearing on such claim for relief, and the claimant may appear at the hearing if he so desires. The claimant shall be given not less than ten days’ written notice of the date of the hearing, such notice to be mailed to his last-known address.
      </li>

       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16a">
         If the board of claims is satisfied that any licenses were destroyed due to fire, flood, act of God, or any other cause beyond the control of the claimant and that destruction was not due in part to his negligence, then the board of claims may entirely relieve the claimant of the responsibility to account for such licenses or make such lesser adjustment as the board of claims may deem proper.
        </li>
        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16b">
         If the board of claims is satisfied that any licenses were either lost, stolen, or destroyed under circumstances other than those set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection (6), the board of claims may, in its discretion, make an adjustment of the amount due for any such licenses. The board of claims, in determining what adjustment, if any, shall be allowed for any lost, stolen, or destroyed licenses, may consider the following:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16bI">
           Whether or not, or the extent to which, the loss was due to the negligence or carelessness of the claimant in the handling of licenses, but no adjustment shall be made in the case of gross negligence or gross carelessness upon his part;

          <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol16bII">

       The board of claims, in the event that it makes any adjustment upon a claim, may, in its discretion, require the use of such protection against the possibility of future loss, theft, or destruction of licenses as it may deem proper, including, but not limited to, the posting of corporate or personal surety bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol18">
       It is the legislative intent of subsections (2) to (7) of this section to provide in proper cases for the relief of license agents where licenses have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, which relief, however, shall be strictly construed, it being the further intent of such sections to encourage the proper and careful handling of licenses by license agents.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-101ol19">
       The commission may promulgate rules and regulations for the cash sale of licenses, at a price which is discounted five percent from the face value thereof, to license agents of the division for resale to the public at the face value stated on such a license. Only the license agents of the division in good standing may qualify to purchase and sell under this subsection (9); except that no evidence of financial responsibility shall be required to qualify under this subsection (9). A post or base exchange of the United States government located in Colorado may qualify as a license agent for the purpose of this subsection (9). Failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission and lawful directives of the division regarding license agents shall be grounds for the suspension or termination of the license agency, and, upon suspension or termination, all unsold licenses shall be returned immediately to the division for return of cash in the amount paid by the license agent for the licenses. The commission, in connection with a program which it may adopt under this subsection (9), shall provide for redemption by the division, at least annually, of any unsold licenses in the amount paid by the license agent for such unsold licenses. The provisions of subsections (1) to (8) of this section, except the provisions of subsection (1) regarding the designation of license agents, shall not apply to licenses sold under this subsection (9).

       The commission may authorize certain employees to sell licenses for the face value thereof at the headquarters and regional offices of the division. Such employees are not entitled to five percent of the face value of the licenses and are not required to give evidence of financial responsibility. Such employees may make claims under oath for relief from responsibility for licenses or moneys which have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and for which the employees are unable to account in accordance with the provisions of subsections (4) to (8) of this section.

        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-103ol11a">
         The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the wildlife resources of the state are in danger of decline from increasing population pressures and the loss of wildlife habitat. In order to encourage private landowners to provide habitat that increases wildlife populations for the benefit of all hunters, discourage the harboring of game animals on private lands during public hunting seasons, and relieve hunting pressure on public lands by increasing game hunting on private lands, the general assembly finds that it is necessary to provide an incentive-based system to landowners to provide habitat for wildlife through a hunting license allocation program that allows hunters access to the state’s wildlife under the cooperative control of the private landowner.

        <li id="t33-wildlife-ar04-s33-4-103ol11b">

     <p>
      If the possession, use, importation, exportation, transportation, storage, sale, or offering or exposing for sale of wildlife is prohibited or restricted by articles 1 to 6 of this title or by rule or regulation of the commission, the prohibition or restriction, where not otherwise specifically provided, shall extend to and include every part of such wildlife, and a violation as to each animal or part thereof shall be a separate offense. Two or more offenses may be charged in the same complaint, information, or indictment, and proof as to part of an animal shall be sufficient to sustain a charge as to the whole of it. Violations as to any number of animals of the same kind may be charged in the same count and punished as a separate offense as to each animal.

       ANNOTATION
      </h4>
      <p>
       The term “related activity” in subsection (1)(c) is not unconstitutionally vague.
       A person of ordinary intelligence would know that if his or her criminal conviction has a close and logical connection to the person’s hunting, trapping, or fishing activity, such conduct falls within the ambit of potential license suspension under this section. Woodrow v. Wildlife Comm’n, 206 P.3d 835 (Colo. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment of the United States constitution is not violated when a license suspension under this section is based on the same facts as the criminal charges.
       License suspension under this section is a civil, not criminal, sanction. Furthermore, the primary goal of the general assembly in providing such civil sanction was not the imposition of punishment on the licensee, but the remedial purpose of protecting the public’s interest in the state’s wildlife. Woodrow v. Wildlife Comm’n, 206 P.3d 835 (Colo. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       A two-year extension of an existing suspension under subsection (6) does not count as a separate suspension
       for purposes of a lifetime suspension under subsection (8). Quercioli v.

       This section does not create a strict liability offense.
       The culpable mental state of “knowingly” is implied for there to be a violation of this section. To be liable for “taking” wildlife, one must know that one is taking possession of wildlife. Even for a strict liability offense, the state must prove that the defendant committed a voluntary act. Therefore, when a major rainstorm caused a wastewater containment pond to overflow and kill fish in a river, the owner of the pond has not knowingly taken the fish, nor has the owner even committed a voluntary act or omission. Because the state did not allege or prove any knowing, voluntary act, the grant of summary judgment to the state was in error and the denial of the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was also in error.

       The division may bring and maintain a civil action against any person, in the name of the people of the state, to recover possession or value or both possession and value of any wildlife taken in violation of articles 1 to 6 of this title. A writ of replevin may issue in such an action without bond. No previous demand for possession shall be necessary. If costs or damages are adjudged in favor of the defendant, the same shall be paid out of the wildlife cash fund. Neither the pendency of such civil action nor a criminal prosecution for the same taking shall be a bar to the other; nor shall anything in this section affect the right of seizure under other provisions of articles 1 to 6 of this title. The following shall be considered the minimum value of the wildlife unlawfully taken or possessed and may be recovered in addition to recovery of possession of the wildlife:

       ANNOTATION
      </h4>
      <p>
       The intent element for the crime of killing and abandoning wildlife is that of knowingly.
       In order to be guilty of killing and abandoning wildlife, the defendant must “knowingly” kill and abandon wildlife. People v. Lawrence, 55 P.3d 155 (Colo. App. 2001) (decided prior to 2008 amendment to subsection (1)).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mental state “knowingly”
       is implied by “to take and abandon wildlife” because the language of the abandonment offense logically requires knowing that one abandoned wildlife. Nothing in that language is tied to specific intent, recklessness, or neglect. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007) (decided prior to 2008 amendment to subsection (1)).
      </p>
      <p>
       With the words, "to hunt or take...wildlife and detach or remove,
       with the intent to abandon the carcass or body, only the head, hide, claws, teeth, antlers, horns, internal organs, or feathers, or any or all of such parts", the general assembly made it an offense to hunt or kill an animal with the intent to keep only certain parts and to abandon the rest of the carcass. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Abandon” is used here in its ordinary sense.
       No special, legal meaning is ascribed to the term, and it was not necessary that defendant break camp or leave the state to be found to have abandoned elk carcasses. People v. Dobson, 847 P.2d 176 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “to abandon the carcass or body of such wildlife; or to take and abandon wildlife”
       is to be read to stand on its own. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Willful destruction of wildlife
       requires proof that a person removed the trophy portions of any wild animal and abandoned the carcass. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general assembly
       enacted different penal provisions for each offense, identified each with a different title, and, thus, intended to establish more than one offense; therefore, violations of this section and §§

       constitute separate offenses. People v. Gordon, 160 P.3d 284 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       By using the disjunctive “or” between subsections (1)(a)(II) and (1)(a)(III),
       the legislature intended to describe three alternate, independent ways of committing willful destruction of wildlife. People ex rel. M.C.,
       <cite class="COA">
        2012 COA 64
       </cite>
       , 292 P.3d 1030.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (1)(a)(I), (1)(a)(II), and (1)(a)(III) each constitute an independent offense, and a violation of one is not dependent upon engaging in any of the acts described in another. People ex rel. M.C.,
       <cite class="COA">
        2012 COA 64
       </cite>
       , 292 P.3d 1030.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1)(a)(II) is not void for vagueness.
       People ex rel. M.C.,
       <cite class="COA">
        2012 COA 64
       </cite>
       , 292 P.3d 1030.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to the term “taken”, a person of common intelligence has sufficient notice that subsection (1)(a)(II) could apply to his or her abandonment of wildlife taken by another person. People ex rel. M.C.,
       <cite class="COA">

       , 292 P.3d 1030.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to the term “abandon”, a person of common intelligence would understand subsection (1)(a)(II) to impose liability where the actor has acquired an interest or right in the carcass of wildlife taken by another and then abandoned it. People ex rel. M.C.,

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar10-s33-10-107ol11">
       The commission has power to:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33-parks-ar10-s33-10-107ol11a">
         Acquire by gift, transfer, lease, purchase, or long-term operating agreement such land and water, or interests in land and water, as the director, with the approval of the executive director, deems necessary, suitable, or proper for parks and outdoor recreation purposes or for the preservation or conservation of sites, scenes, open space, and vistas of public interest. As used in this section, “interest in land and water” means any and all rights and interest in land less than the full fee interest, including future interests, easements, covenants, and contractual rights. Every interest in land and water held by the commission when properly recorded runs with the land or water to which it pertains for the benefit of the citizens of this state and may be protected and enforced by the commission in the district court of the county in which the land or water, or any portion thereof, is located.
        </li>
        <li id="t33-parks-ar10-s33-10-107ol11b">
         Lease, exchange, or sell any property, water rights, land, or interest in land or water rights, including oil, gas, and other organic and inorganic substances which now are or may become surplus or which, in the proper management of the division, the commission desires to lease, exchange, or sell. All sales of property, water rights, or lands shall be at public sale, and the commission has the right to reject any or all bids. As used in this paragraph (b), “exchange” means the transferring of property, water rights, land, or interest in land or water rights to another person in consideration for the transfer to the commission of other property, water rights, land, or interest in land or water rights, or cash, or any combination thereof; except that any cash received may not exceed fifty percent of the total value of the consideration. A transaction otherwise qualifying as an exchange is not deemed a sale merely because dollar values have been assigned to any property, water rights, land, or interest in land or water rights, for the purpose of ensuring that the commission will receive adequate compensation.

        <li id="t33-parks-ar10-s33-10-107ol11c">

Except as provided in section  33-10-111 (1), fees and charges collected pursuant to this subsection (1)(h) shall be credited to the parks and outdoor recreation cash fund created in section  33-10-111 (1).

       In the event that the commission plans to acquire the fee title to any real property at a cost that exceeds one hundred thousand dollars or to acquire an easement for a period that exceeds twenty-five years or at a cost that exceeds one hundred thousand dollars or to enter into any lease agreement for the use of real property for a period that exceeds twenty-five years or at a cost that exceeds one hundred thousand dollars, or to sell or otherwise dispose of such property, after the commission has approved of the transaction but before it has completed the transaction, the commission shall submit a report to the capital development committee that outlines the anticipated use of the real property, the maintenance costs related to the property, the current value of the property, any conditions or limitations that may restrict the use of the property, and, in the event real property is acquired, the potential liability to the state that will result from the acquisition. The capital development committee shall review the reports submitted by the commission and make recommendations to the commission concerning the proposed land transaction within thirty days from the day on which the report is received. The commission shall not complete the transaction without considering the recommendations of the capital development committee, if the recommendations are made in a timely manner.

       In order to provide for the greatly increasing outdoor needs of a rapidly expanding Colorado population for public access to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the out-of-doors areas of Colorado and for the conservation, development, and use of natural resources against fire and other natural and geological hazards, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of this state and among the purposes of this article to: Increase the accessibility and encourage the use of such natural resources by the residents of this state and by nonresidents; provide opportunity for the development of public and private facilities for persons visiting and utilizing the natural resources of this state; encourage an increase in riding, hiking, bicycling, and other compatible recreational activities as influences for the improvement of the health and welfare of the people; and to provide for the needs of specialized recreational motor vehicles. It is recognized that joint simultaneous trail use by motorized and nonmotorized interests may at times be incompatible, and it is the intent of this article to provide separate trails and facilities for each of such motorized and nonmotorized interests, when feasible.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-102ol12">
       To implement the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and as additional purposes of this article, the state may: Establish and maintain trails on a statewide basis to connect, when feasible and practical, the units of the parks and outdoor recreation system, federal recreational lands, and other trails systems; perpetuate and provide the use of and access to regions and trails of special or historic interest within the state; assist local governments in serving the requirements of the urban and other population centers of the state; encourage the multiple use of public rights-of-way and utilize to the fullest extent the existing and future scenic roads, highways, parkways, and federally administered trails where feasible as recreational trails; encourage the development and maintenance of recreational trails by counties, cities, and special improvement districts and assist in such development and maintenance by all means available; coordinate trail plans and development among legal jurisdictions and with the state and federal governments; encourage, when possible, the development of trails on federal lands by the federal government; and promote at all levels of government a more complete use of all or any portion of public property for recreational purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-102ol13">
       A further purpose of this article is to promote the establishment and operation of a statewide network of trails, to be known as the “Colorado greenway trails system”, along and between the state’s lakes, streams, or reservoirs linking cities, towns, communities, and river basins. The Colorado greenway trails system shall be established and operated in a manner that promotes recreational opportunities along lakes, streams, or reservoirs, that provides access to and is a part of an integrated trail system, that protects water rights and real property rights, and that minimizes conflicts between recreationists and others to minimize adverse impacts on natural features and sensitive habitats.

       In order to provide recreational trails in a statewide system of positive recreational value, the division may acquire reasonable trail rights-of-way or easements. In selecting the rights-of-way, full consideration shall be given to minimizing the adverse effects upon the adjacent landowner or user and his operation. Development and management of each segment of the trails system shall be designed to harmonize with and complement any established multiple-use plans for that specific area in order to insure continued maximum benefits from the land. Acquisition shall be, whenever possible, through donations, purchased with donated funds, or through easements and exchanges. When such methods fail, the division may authorize expenditure of state appropriations for acquisition in fee. Agreements for less than fee shall be for terms of not less than twenty-five years whenever possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-104ol12">
       The division may abandon all or any portion of a trail or easement acquired for trail purposes which is no longer necessary for such purposes, or it may transfer any trail or easement acquired for trail purposes to a local government having jurisdiction over the area in which the trail or easement is located if such local government agrees to maintain and operate the trail.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-104ol13">
       The division shall notify the owner of land through which any trail or easement acquired for trail purposes passes prior to entering into an operating agreement for that trail with any local government, and it shall secure the consent of the landowner prior to the transfer of any trail or easement acquired for trail purposes to a local government.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-104ol14">
       Nothing in this article shall permit the acquisition of recreational trails by proceedings in eminent domain by any state agency or any unit of local government or any agency thereof; except that, when a recreational trail is included within a highway right-of-way, the department of transportation may acquire such contiguous land as a part of the right-of-way as is necessary to permit the uninterrupted continuation of the recreational trail.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-104ol15">
       Nothing in this section modifies, impairs, or supersedes the authority of the commission or the ability of the division to acquire any interest in water or water rights pursuant to section  33-10-107 (1)(a).

      <li id="t33-parks-ar11-s33-11-104ol16">
       Trails acquired pursuant to this article shall not be used for purposes of annexation or access to private lands. Access to private property may be allowed upon consent of the landowner. Nothing in this subsection (6) shall preclude the annexation of private lands with the consent of the landowner.

     Legislative declaration
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the system of state parks and state recreation areas is vital to the economic health and well-being of the entire state of Colorado and that such system of parks and recreation areas provides an important benefit to the citizens of this state and to the tourists from outside the state who visit and make use of such state parks and recreation areas. Because of the nature and operation of such state parks and recreation areas, the system can be largely self-supporting, and the users of such resources can help to fund the system’s operation and maintenance. The general assembly declares and intends that as a matter of state policy the system of state parks and state recreation areas should be financed as much as reasonably possible through revenues derived from the users of such system.

       The director may designate sole proprietors, partnerships, or corporations having permanent business locations in this state as pass and registration agents to sell, at their permanent business locations, passes and registrations. Pass and registration agents shall be paid a commission on all moneys collected for passes and registrations sold by such agents in an amount determined by the commission by rule. All agents authorized to sell passes and registrations shall keep accurate records of all sales of passes and registrations and shall make such reports to the division regarding pass and registration sales as may be required. Such agents shall be required to give evidence of financial responsibility, in the form of a savings account, deposit, or certificate of deposit meeting the requirements of section  11-35-101, C.R.S., or an irrevocable letter of credit meeting the requirements of section  .5, C.R.S., or a bond, in such amount as may be fixed by the division to insure the remittance of all moneys collected from such pass and registration sales, less amounts allowed as commissions, and the making of reports required by the division. The commission may promulgate rules for the establishment and cancellation of pass and registration agencies. All pass and registration moneys received shall be kept separate and apart from any other moneys of the agent authorized to sell passes and registrations and shall at all times belong to the state. All moneys due from the sale of passes and registrations belong to the state and shall draw interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from the time that the agency is cancelled by the division until paid.

      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol12">
       The executive director, state auditor, and attorney general, or their duly designated representatives, shall constitute a board of claims for the hearing of all claims for relief when any agent is unable to account for passes and registrations and claims that the same have been destroyed, lost, or stolen. The findings of the board of claims are subject to review pursuant to section  24-4-106, C.R.S. Claims for relief in an amount totaling one hundred dollars or less shall not be determined by the board of claims, except as otherwise provided in this section, but shall be settled by the division. If the division offers to make settlement and such settlement is not accepted by the claimant, the claimant may submit his claim to the board of claims.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol13">
       Every agent authorized to sell passes and registrations shall account for all passes and registrations delivered to such agent. If any agent is not able to account for any pass or registration, such agent shall be responsible for the maximum amount for which each unaccounted-for pass or registration could have been issued, except as provided in subsections (4) to (8) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol14">
       Any agent authorized to sell passes and registrations may make a claim under oath for relief from responsibility for passes and registrations which have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and for which such agent is unable to account, but no claim for relief shall be considered unless the agent making the claim informs the division of such loss, theft, or destruction within thirty days after such loss, theft, or destruction is discovered, said notice to set forth in detail all pertinent information then known to the agent. Upon receipt of any claim for relief, it is the duty of the division to make an investigation of the claim as soon as practicable, and for that purpose the claimant shall make available such records, information, or other pertinent data as may be in his possession or under his control. A written report of such investigation shall be filed with the board of claims.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol15">
       As soon as practicable after receipt of the investigator’s report and in no event later than one hundred twenty days after receipt of notice of a claim for relief, the board of claims shall set a date for the hearing on such claim for relief, and the claimant may appear at the hearing if he so desires. The claimant shall be given not less than ten days’ written notice of the date of the hearing, such notice to be mailed to his last-known address.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol16">
       The board of claims may give relief to any claimant in the following circumstances and subject to the following limitations:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol16a">
         If the board of claims is satisfied that any passes or registrations were destroyed due to fire, flood, act of God, or any other cause beyond the control of the claimant and that destruction was not due in part to his negligence, then the board of claims may entirely relieve the claimant of the responsibility to account for such passes and registrations or make such lesser adjustment as the board of claims may deem proper.
        </li>
        <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol16b">
         If the board of claims is satisfied that any passes or registrations were either lost, stolen, or destroyed under circumstances other than those set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection (6), the board of claims may, in its discretion, make an adjustment of the amount due for any such passes or registrations. The board of claims, in determining what adjustment, if any, shall be allowed for any lost, stolen, or destroyed passes and registrations, may consider the following:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol16bI">
           Whether or not, or the extent to which, the loss was due to the negligence or carelessness of the claimant in the handling of passes and registrations, but no adjustment shall be made in the case of gross negligence or gross carelessness upon his part;
          </li>
          <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol16bII">
           Such other evidence as the board of claims may consider pertinent.

           The general assembly therefore recognizes the need to provide opportunities for Colorado’s severely injured “wounded warriors” to enjoy the natural resources of the state as part of their rehabilitative care. Furthermore, offering free entrance to state parks and recreation areas to such recovering service members is a small, but recognizable, acknowledgment of their selfless service and sacrifice.

       The board of claims, in the event that it makes any adjustment upon a claim, may, in its discretion, require the use of such protection against the possibility of lost, stolen, or destroyed passes and registrations as it may deem proper, including, but not limited to, the posting of corporate or personal surety bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol18">
       It is the legislative intent of subsections (2) to (7) of this section to provide in proper cases for the relief of agents where passes or registrations have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, which relief, however, shall be strictly construed, it being the further intent of such subsections to encourage the proper and careful handling of such documents by pass and registration agents.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol19">
       The commission may promulgate rules for the cash sale of passes and registrations to pass and registration agents of the division for resale to the public. Only agents of the division in good standing may qualify to purchase and sell under this subsection (9); except that no evidence of financial responsibility shall be required to qualify under this subsection (9). A post or base exchange of the United States government located in Colorado may qualify as an agent for the purpose of this subsection (9). Failure to comply with all applicable rules of the commission and lawful directives of the division regarding pass and registration agents constitutes grounds for the suspension or termination of such an agent, and, upon suspension or termination, all unsold passes and registrations shall be returned immediately to the division for return of cash in the amount paid by the agent for the passes and registrations. The commission, in connection with a program that it may adopt under this subsection (9), shall provide for redemption by the division, at least annually, of any unsold passes and registrations in the amount paid by the agent for such unsold passes and registrations. Subsections (1) to (8) of this section, except the provisions of subsection (1) regarding the designation of pass and registration agents, do not apply to passes and registrations sold under this subsection (9).

      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol110">
       The commission may authorize certain employees to sell passes and registrations at the headquarters and regional offices of the division. Such employees are not entitled to a discount off of the face value of the passes and registrations and are not required to give evidence of financial responsibility. Such employees may make claims under oath for relief from responsibility for passes and registrations or moneys that have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and for which the employees are unable to account in accordance with subsections (4) to (8) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol111">
       Any pass or registration agent who fails, upon demand of the division or its authorized representative, to account for passes and registrations or who fails to pay over to the division or its authorized representative moneys received from the sale of passes and registrations:

        <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol111a">
         When the amount in question is less than two hundred dollars, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not less than two hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment;

        <li id="t33-parks-ar12-s33-12-104ol111b">
         When the amount in question is two hundred dollars or more, commits a class 6 felony and shall be punished as provided in section  18-1.3-401, C.R.S., which punishment shall include a fine in an amount set out in section  18-1.3-401 (1)(a)(III), C.R.S.

The operator of the vessel shall produce the registration for inspection upon demand of any officer authorized to enforce articles 10 to 15 and 32 of this title 33.

     Application for vessel number

     <ol>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar13-s33-13-104ol11">
       The owner of each vessel requiring numbering by this state shall file an application for a number with the division or any representative approved by the division on forms approved and furnished by the division. The owner of the vessel must sign the application and pay an application fee as specified by the commission by rule; except that those vessels owned and operated by the state or any political subdivision of the state must be registered without payment of a registration fee. Upon receipt of the application in approved form, the division or its representative shall issue to the applicant a registration stating the number issued to the vessel. The number issued shall be painted on or attached to each side of the bow on the forward half of the vessel or, if there are no such sides, at a corresponding location on both sides of the foredeck of the vessel for which it is issued. The number issued must read from left to right in block characters of good proportion having a minimum of three inches in height, excluding border or trim, and of a color that contrasts with the color of the background, and must remain clearly visible and legible. Other numbers must not be carried on the bow of the vessel. Any person who fails to display a vessel number as required in this subsection (1) is guilty of a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of twenty-five dollars.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar13-s33-13-104ol12">
       The registration shall be of pocket size and shall be on board and available at all times for inspection whenever the vessel for which it is issued is in operation in this state. Any person who violates this subsection (2) is guilty of a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of fifty dollars. If a registration is lost or destroyed, the owner shall, within fifteen days, notify the division. The notification shall be in writing, shall describe the circumstances of the loss or destruction, and shall be accompanied by a fee for a replacement registration as required under section  33-12-101.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar13-s33-13-104ol13">
       When a numbered vessel is lost, destroyed, or abandoned, the registration issued for the vessel shall be surrendered to the division within fifteen days after any such event. When the owner of a numbered vessel changes his or her address from that shown on the registration, the owner shall notify the division within fifteen days of such change and, as a part of such notification, shall furnish the division with his or her new address. The commission may provide in its rules for the surrender of the registration bearing the former address and its replacement with a registration bearing the correct address or for the alteration of an outstanding registration to show the new address of the owner.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar13-s33-13-104ol14">
       All fees collected under this section shall be credited to the parks and outdoor recreation cash fund and shall be used for the administration of this article.

Upon a subsequent conviction, the person shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for not less than ninety days nor more than one year and, in the discretion of the court, by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than three thousand dollars. The minimum jail sentence imposed by this subsection (1) shall be mandatory, and the court shall not grant probation or a suspended sentence. However, in a case where the defendant is convicted and it is established that it was necessary to operate the vessel in violation of this subsection (1) because of an emergency, the mandatory jail sentence shall not apply, and, for a conviction, the court may impose a sentence of imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year and, in the discretion of the court, a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, and, for a subsequent conviction, the court may impose a sentence of imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than two years and, in the discretion of the court, a fine of not more than three thousand dollars.

Identification photographs and fingerprints that are part of the record of such former convictions and judgments and the party’s incarceration after sentencing for any of such former convictions and judgments shall be prima facie evidence of the identity of the party and may be used in evidence against the party.

      Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent municipal corporations or quasi-municipal corporations, including, but not limited to, metropolitan recreation districts, from policing lakes or bodies of water located within all or part of the territorial boundaries of any such entities. Any person designated by such entities to engage in policing work upon said bodies of water may be commissioned by the division to enforce the provisions of this article as an authorized representative of the division. In addition, said entities shall also be empowered to charge and collect reasonable permit fees to defer the expense of such policing operations without the obligation of remitting such fees to the division, but such fees shall be in addition to those otherwise provided for in this article. Such entities are empowered to adopt and enforce reasonable rules and regulations governing the use of vessels on the bodies of water patrolled under their supervision if such rules and regulations do not conflict with the provisions of this article.

     Imposition of penalty - procedures
     </h3>

      <li id="t33-parks-ar15-s33-15-102ol11">
       A person is guilty of a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of one hundred dollars for a violation of any of the following for which there is not an associated statutory penalty listed:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t33-parks-ar15-s33-15-102ol11a">
         Any provision of articles 10 to 15 or article 32 of this title 33; or
        </li>
        <li id="t33-parks-ar15-s33-15-102ol11b">
         A rule of the commission promulgated pursuant to one or more of the articles specified in subsection (1)(a) of this section.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t33-parks-ar15-s33-15-102ol12">
       At the time that any person is charged with violating any petty offense or misdemeanor provisions of articles 10 to 15 or 32 of this title or any rule of the commission, the officer shall issue a summons and complaint to the alleged offender or, in the case of a violation for which a fine of a fixed amount is prescribed, may give the alleged offender an opportunity to voluntarily pay the fine and surcharge in the form of a penalty assessment. Penalty assessments shall not be issued for violations for which minimum and maximum fines have been established. The penalty assessment notice given to the alleged offender shall contain the information required in and be in the form of a summons and complaint and shall specify in dollars the amount of the penalty to be assessed for the alleged offense and the amount of the surcharge to be collected pursuant to section  24-33.5-415.6, C.R.S. If the alleged offender accepts such notice and pays the fine and surcharge entered thereon to the division within twenty days of issuance of the notice, such acceptance and payment shall constitute an acknowledgment of guilt by such person of the violation set forth in the penalty assessment notice. Any person who accepts a penalty assessment notice but who does not furnish satisfactory evidence of identity or who the officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe will disregard a written promise to pay the specified fine and surcharge may be taken by the officer to the nearest known post-office facility and be required to remit the amount of the specified fine and surcharge to the division immediately by mail in United States currency or other legal tender or by money order or personal check. Refusal or inability to remit the specified fine and surcharge by mail when required shall constitute a refusal to accept a penalty assessment notice. Checks tendered by the violator to and accepted by the division and on which payment is received by the division shall be deemed sufficient receipt. If the fine and surcharge are not so paid, then the officer who issued the penalty assessment notice shall docket the summons and complaint with a court of competent jurisdiction for appearance by the person to answer the charges therein contained at such time and place as is specified in the summons and complaint.

     Legislative declaration
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly declares that it is the policy of this state to promote and encourage residents and nonresidents alike to participate in the enjoyment and use of the rivers of this state and, to that end, in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of safeguarding the health, safety, welfare, and freedom from injury or danger of such residents and nonresidents, to license and regulate those persons who provide river-running services in the nature of equipment or personal services to such residents and nonresidents for the purpose of floating on rivers in this state unless the provider of such river-running services is providing such river-running services exclusively for family or friends. It is not the intent of the general assembly to interfere in any way with private land owner rights along rivers or to prevent the owners of whitewater equipment from using said equipment to accommodate friends when no consideration is involved; nor is it the intent of the general assembly to interfere in any way with the general public’s ability to enjoy the recreational value of state rivers when the services of river outfitters are not utilized or to interfere with the right of the United States to manage public lands and waters under its control. The general assembly recognizes that river outfitters, as an established business on rivers flowing within and without this state, make a significant contribution to the economy of this state and that the number of residents and nonresidents who are participating in river-running is steadily increasing.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that certain lands and waters of this state representing diverse ecosystems, ecological communities, and other natural features or phenomena, which are our natural heritage, are increasingly threatened with irreversible change and are in need of special identification and protection and that it is in the public interest of present and future generations to preserve, protect, perpetuate, and enhance specific examples of these natural features and phenomena as an enduring resource. It is the intent of this article to provide a means by which these natural features and phenomena can be identified, evaluated, and protected through a statewide system of designated natural areas.

       Landowners are entitled to protection by knowingly permitting recreational use of their property.
       A subjective intent requirement is not required. Instead, it is enough that a landowner’s purposeful actions implicitly allowed or acquiesced in the use of the land. Nelson v. United States, 827 F.3d 927 (10th Cir. 2016).

       “[K]nowingly” refers to
       one’s awareness of objective facts, while “willfully” pertains to one’s subjective intent to act on—or in spite of—that awareness. Nelson v. United States, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       To be “willful”, an action must be taken voluntarily, purposefully, and with a conscious disregard for the consequences of the act.
       It is more than negligence. Willfulness does not, however, require that a government employee be consciously aware that his or her acts or omissions create danger or risk to the safety of others, or that the employee intended to harm another. Nelson v. United States, 256 F. Supp. 3d 1136 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 2017
       </cite>
       ), aff’d, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       The knowledge element of the liability exception
       in subsection (1)(a) is not qualified by “reason to know” and thus requires actual knowledge. Further, that knowledge element applies to both the existence of the dangerous condition and the likelihood that it will cause harm. Nelson v. United States, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Accordingly, a landowner may be liable only if its agent actually knew of the existence of a sinkhole that caused a user’s injuries and that the sinkhole was likely to cause harm. Nelson v. United States, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       A “dangerous condition” is a physical condition of a facility or the use of a facility that constitutes an unreasonable risk to the health or safety of the public.
       Nelson v. United States, 256 F. Supp. 3d 1136 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 2017

      </p>
      <p>
       Taxpayer status does not satisfy the “charge” requirement of subsection (1)(b).
       Kirkland v. United States, 930 F. Supp. 1443 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1996
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “incidental to the use of land”
       requires that a nexus exist between the commercial or business enterprise and the use giving rise to the injury. Smith v. Cutty’s Inc., 742 P.2d 347 (Colo. App. 1987); Kirkland v. United States, 930 F. Supp. 1443 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1996
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       A sinkhole/washout was a dangerous condition likely to cause harm to users of a bike path.
       A sinkhole has a high probability of causing harm to a person riding a bicycle on a recreational path the landowner knows is used by cyclists if the sinkhole is of significant size and depth, covers the entire width of the path, and is hard to see. Nelson v. United States, 256 F. Supp. 3d 1136 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 2017
       </cite>
       ), aff’d, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landowner’s agent’s knowledge of a sinkhole/washout is imputed to the landowner
       by operation of law. Landowner and its agent knew that the path existed, knew significant erosion problems existed in that area, and specifically knew, two weeks before a cyclist was injured, of the existence of the dangerous condition on the bike path caused by erosion. Nelson v. United States, 256 F. Supp. 3d 1136 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 2017
       </cite>
       ), aff’d, 915 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landowner’s conduct in failing to guard or warn users of a bike path against the dangerous condition it knew existed on its property was willful.
       Nelson v. United States, 256 F. Supp. 3d 1136 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 2017

      </p>

       Landowner and its agent willfully ignored the dangerous condition on the bike path

     Legislative declaration
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that it is in the interest of the state of Colorado to establish reasonable safety standards for the operation of ski areas and for the skiers using them. Realizing the dangers that inhere in the sport of skiing, regardless of any and all reasonable safety measures that can be employed, the purpose of this article 44 is to supplement the passenger tramway safety provisions of article 150 of title 12; to further define the legal responsibilities of ski area operators and their agents and employees; to define the responsibilities of skiers using such ski areas; and to define the rights and liabilities existing between the skier and the ski area operator and between skiers.

       Purpose of this act
       is to establish reasonable safety standards and to define relative rights and responsibilities of ski area operators and skiers. Graven v. Vail Assocs., Inc., 909 P.2d 514 (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       But neither this act nor the statutory provisions concerning passenger tramway safety (part 7 of article 5 of title 25, C.R.S.) preempts or supersedes the common law standard of care applicable to ski lift operators,
       to use the highest degree of care commensurate with the practical operation of the lift, regardless of the season. The general assembly did not intend for the regulations adopted by the tramway board to preclude common law negligence actions against ski lift operators or the duty to exercise the highest degree of care. Bayer v. Crested Butte Mtn. Resort, 960 P.2d 70 (Colo. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither this act nor the statutory provisions concerning passenger tramway safety (part 7 of article 5 of title 25) bars exculpatory agreements.
       Brigance v. Vail Summit Resorts, Inc., 883 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       By excluding ski lift accidents from the definition of “inherent dangers and risks of skiing”,
       the general assembly clearly chose not to alter the common law standard of care applicable to ski lift safety: the highest degree of care commensurate with the practical operation of the lift, regardless of the season. Bayer v. Crested Butte Mtn. Resort, 960 P.2d 70 (Colo. 1998).

     <ol>
      <li id="t33-recreationalareasandskisafety-ar44-s33-44-109ol11">
       Each skier solely has the responsibility for knowing the range of his own ability to negotiate any ski slope or trail and to ski within the limits of such ability. Each skier expressly accepts and assumes the risk of and all legal responsibility for any injury to person or property resulting from any of the inherent dangers and risks of skiing; except that a skier is not precluded under this article from suing another skier for any injury to person or property resulting from such other skier’s acts or omissions. Notwithstanding any provision of law or statute to the contrary, the risk of a skier/skier collision is neither an inherent risk nor a risk assumed by a skier in an action by one skier against another.

      <li id="t33-recreationalareasandskisafety-ar44-s33-44-109ol12">
       Each skier has the duty to maintain control of his speed and course at all times when skiing and to maintain a proper lookout so as to be able to avoid other skiers and objects. However, the primary duty shall be on the person skiing downhill to avoid collision with any person or objects below him.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-recreationalareasandskisafety-ar44-s33-44-109ol13">

      </li>
      <li id="t33-recreationalareasandskisafety-ar44-s33-44-109ol15">
       Each skier has the duty to heed all posted information and other warnings and to refrain from acting in a manner which may cause or contribute to the injury of the skier or others. Each skier shall be presumed to have seen and understood all information posted in accordance with this article near base area lifts, on the passenger tramways, and on such ski slopes or trails as he is skiing. Under conditions of decreased visibility, the duty is on the skier to locate and ascertain the meaning of all signs posted in accordance with sections  33-44-106 and  33-44-107.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-recreationalareasandskisafety-ar44-s33-44-109ol16">
       Each ski or snowboard used by a skier while skiing shall be equipped with a strap or other device capable of stopping the ski or snowboard should the ski or snowboard become unattached from the skier. This requirement shall not apply to cross country skis.
      </li>

      <li id="t33-recreationalareasandskisafety-ar44-s33-44-109ol19">
       No person shall move uphill on any passenger tramway or use any ski slope or trail while such person’s ability to do so is impaired by the consumption of alcohol or by the use of any controlled substance, as defined in section  18-18-102 (5), C.R.S., or other drug or while such person is under the influence of alcohol or any controlled substance, as defined in section  18-18-102 (5), C.R.S., or other drug.

       No skier involved in a collision with another skier or person in which an injury results shall leave the vicinity of the collision before giving his or her name and current address to an employee of the ski area operator or a member of the ski patrol, except for the purpose of securing aid for a person injured in the collision; in which event the person so leaving the scene of the collision shall give his or her name and current address as required by this subsection (10) after securing such aid.
      </li>
      <li id="t33-recreationalareasandskisafety-ar44-s33-44-109ol111">
       No person shall knowingly enter upon public or private lands from an adjoining ski area when such land has been closed by its owner and so posted by the owner or by the ski area operator pursuant to section  33-44-107 (6).

       Annotator’s note.
       The annotations to this section include a case decided prior to the 1990 amendment of subsection (2).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ski Safety Act of 1979 does not establish negligence per se when an uphill skier collides with a downhill skier.
       Hendrickson v. Doyle, 150 F. Supp. 3d 1233 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 2015
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “responsibility” encompasses the legal concept of “fault”.
       In effect, the statute creates a rebuttable presumption that the skier is at fault whenever he collides with other skiers and objects, and “fault” may be defined as the equivalent of negligence. Pizza v. Wolf Creek Ski Dev. Corp., 711 P.2d 671 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the connection between “responsibility” and “negligence”, in the context of a skiing accident case, the term “responsibility” may be equated with the concept of “negligence” for purposes of applying the presumption contained within this section. Pizza v. Wolf Creek Ski Dev. Corp., 711 P.2d 671 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “natural object” is not unconstitutionally vague.
       Pizza v. Wolf Creek Ski Dev. Corp., 711 P.2d 671 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Skiers as a group do not constitute a suspect class,
       and being free from a legislatively imposed rebuttable presumption of negligence is not a fundamental right. Pizza v. Wolf Creek Ski Dev. Corp., 711 P.2d 671 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidentiary presumption
       places upon skier the burden of rebutting the presumption by presenting evidence of the ski area operator’s negligence which outweighs the presumption of the skier’s sole negligence. Pizza v. Wolf Creek Ski Dev. Corp., 711 P.2d 671 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption is not unconstitutionally vague in describing rebuttal burden. Pizza v. Wolf Creek Dev. Corp., 711 P.2d 671 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Traversing is not equivalent to continuously re-entering the slope from one side or the other

       An individual engaging in a recreational activity, unlike an individual who seeks to obtain housing or other necessities of life, is not constrained to participate and accordingly may opt out

       Being “free to walk away” does not mean free from all costs,

       Plaintiff was free to walk away even though she would have forfeited the price of her lift ticket, plus the travel costs she had incurred to reach the resort, if she had chosen not to accept the release of liability. Patterson v. PowderMonarch, LLC, 926 F.3d 633 (10th Cir. 2019).

     Use of general fund moneys by state agencies - prohibition - cash funds
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly finds that the enactment of article XXVII of the state constitution dedicates a significant amount of moneys previously available to meet other state needs to the great outdoors Colorado trust fund and provides for the unrestricted expenditure of such moneys by the trust fund board for the preservation, protection, enhancement, and management of the state’s wildlife, park, river trail, and open space heritage. Accordingly, no general fund moneys shall be used by any state agency for the purpose of funding necessary or incidental management costs which result from a distribution of moneys, land, or any other asset of the great outdoors Colorado trust fund, unless otherwise approved by the general assembly. Moneys derived from user fees and other revenue sources which are generated from programs and completed facilities funded by the great outdoors Colorado trust fund board shall not be transferred or revert to the general fund. Moneys generated from such programs and facilities at state parks shall be credited to the parks and outdoor recreation cash fund created by section
