     This article was numbered as article 22 of chapter 124 in C.R.S. 1963. The provisions of this article were repealed and reenacted in 1985, resulting in the addition, relocation, and elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to this article prior to 1985, consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note and the table itemizing the replacement volumes and supplements to the original volume of C.R.S. 1973 beginning on page vii in the front of this volume.

       The general assembly hereby finds that, for many students, the ability to transfer among all state-supported institutions of higher education is critical to their success in achieving a degree. The general assembly further finds that it is necessary for the state to have sound transfer policies that provide the broadest and simplest mechanisms feasible, while protecting the academic quality of the institutions of higher education and their undergraduate degree programs. The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is in the best interests of the state for the commission to oversee the adoption of a statewide articulation matrix system of course numbering for general education courses that includes all state-supported institutions of higher education and that will ensure that the quality of and requirements that pertain to general education courses are comparable and transferable systemwide.

      , the commission shall identify those circumstances where the waiving of the nonresident differential in tuition rates, on a reciprocal basis with other states, would enhance educational opportunities for Colorado residents. Relative to such identified circumstances, the commission shall negotiate with the other states involved with the objective of establishing reciprocal agreements for the waiving of the nonresidential differential for Colorado residents attending state institutions of higher education in other states in exchange for Colorado state institutions of higher education waiving the nonresident differential for residents of the other states. Agreements negotiated between Colorado and other states shall provide for an equal number of resident and nonresident students to be exchanged between the states. Upon successful completion of such negotiations, the commission may identify the numbers of Colorado residents by grade level whose educational opportunities would be enhanced and the numbers of nonresident students by grade level for whom the nonresident differential is to be waived by the Colorado state institutions of higher education and may direct that the state institutions of higher education grant such waivers. The commission shall establish regulations for the administration of this section, based on the application of the closest college concept, and for the reporting to the general assembly of the numbers of students to whom the waivers are given.

       It is the intent of the general assembly that all state-supported institutions of higher education operate primarily to serve and educate the people of Colorado. The general assembly therefore directs the commission to develop admission policies to ensure that, beginning with the fall term of 1994 and for the fall term of each year thereafter, not less than fifty-five percent of the incoming freshman class at each state-supported institution of higher education are in-state students as defined in section  23-7-102 (5). Commencing with the fall term of 1995, this requirement shall be met if the percentage of in-state students in the incoming freshman class for the then current fall term and the two previous fall terms averages not less than fifty-five percent. Such fifty-five percent requirement shall also apply to the percentage of incoming freshmen students who are admitted based on criteria other than standardized test scores, high school class rank, and high school grade point average pursuant to section  23-1-113 (1)(b). In addition, the commission shall develop admission policies to ensure, beginning with the fiscal year which begins July 1, 1994, and for each fiscal year thereafter, that not less than two-thirds of the total student enrollment, including undergraduate and graduate students, at each campus of each state-supported institution of higher education, except the Colorado school of mines, are in-state students as defined in section  23-7-102 (5) and that not less than sixty percent of the total student enrollment, including undergraduate and graduate students, at the Colorado school of mines are in-state students as defined in section 23-7-102 (5). This requirement shall be met if, commencing with the fiscal year that begins July 1, 1995, the fraction of in-state students, as defined in section 23-7-102 (5), enrolled at each state-supported institution of higher education, except the Colorado school of mines, averages not less than two-thirds of the total fiscal year student enrollment for the then current fiscal year plus the two previous fiscal years. For the Colorado school of mines, this fraction of in-state students shall be not less than three-fifths. Such policies shall be implemented no later than July 1, 1994.

       The general assembly finds that state encouragement would contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of the postsecondary education system in Colorado. Therefore, the general assembly finds and declares that an incentives for improvement initiative grant program should be implemented to encourage initiatives at state institutions of higher education demonstrating innovative solutions and successful approaches to increasing efficiency, productivity, quality, and diversity in the Colorado postsecondary education system through a system of competitive matching grants to such institutions.

       The governing boards of state institutions of higher education, including local district community colleges, or a consortia of such institutions may apply for grants from the commission by submitting proposals for initiatives at their institutions to be designated as incentives for improvement. As used in this section, "incentives for improvement initiative" means any academic initiative of a state institution of higher education that, consistent with the statewide master plan for Colorado postsecondary education, is developed to achieve greater efficiency, productivity, quality, and diversity.

Such criteria shall be developed on or before August 1, 1992. The criteria developed by the commission to evaluate such proposals, designate recipients, and award grants shall take into account the following:

       The general assembly finds that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar01-s23-1-121.7ol11a">
         The number of paraprofessionals who assist teachers in the classroom has increased in recent years both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of all instructional staff;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar01-s23-1-121.7ol11b">
         Paraprofessionals are a valuable asset to school districts, providing many hours of additional instructional time for students, especially as public schools are called upon to provide increasing services for children with disabilities and children for whom English is a second language;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar01-s23-1-121.7ol11c">
         As parents are requesting and school districts are attempting to provide smaller class sizes, the prudent use of well-qualified paraprofessionals to maximize individualized instruction provides school districts with a means to reach every student and to assist every student in reaching his or her full potential;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar01-s23-1-121.7ol11d">
         In passing the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001", Public Law 107-110, congress has expressed the intention that all paraprofessionals working in Title I programs be highly qualified;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar01-s23-1-121.7ol11e">
         A paraprofessional working in a Title I program may demonstrate that he or she is highly qualified in several ways, including completion of at least two years of postsecondary study, obtaining an associates or higher degree, or successfully taking an assessment selected by the state or by the employing school district that meets state and federal standards and that demonstrates knowledge of and the ability to assist in instruction of reading, writing, and mathematics;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar01-s23-1-121.7ol11f">
         Because state and federal laws identify specific criteria for paraprofessional qualification and school districts retain flexibility for using paraprofessional instructional support services, further regulation of paraprofessionals, including certification or licensing, is not required;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar01-s23-1-121.7ol11g">
         To assist school districts in identifying highly qualified paraprofessionals, community colleges and four-year institutions of higher education are strongly encouraged to provide education paraprofessional preparation programs, and it is useful to create a procedure for approval of education paraprofessional preparation programs.

         The general assembly finds and declares that, due to the demands of a global economy, the state and the nation have an increasing need for individuals with a postsecondary credential or degree.

Some students who subsequently accumulate the credit hours necessary for an associate degree while at the four-year institution, or who leave the four-year institution prior to completing a bachelor's degree, would benefit from the award of an associate degree.

If the complaint warrants investigation, the department shall first forward the complaint to the institution for a written response. The institution shall have thirty days to respond in writing to the department and to forward a copy of the response to the student. During the thirty-day period, the institution may attempt to resolve the complaint with the student, and the department shall assist in the efforts to resolve the complaint.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that the provision of a higher or career and technical education for all residents of this state who desire such an education and are properly qualified therefor is important to the welfare and security of this state and nation and, consequently, serves an important public purpose and that many qualified students are deterred by financial considerations from completing their education, with a consequent irreparable loss to the state and nation of talents vital to welfare and security. The number of qualified persons who desire higher or career and technical education is increasing rapidly, and the physical facilities, faculties, and staffs of the institutions of higher education operated by the state will have to be expanded greatly to accommodate such persons, with an attendant sharp increase in the cost of educating such persons. A system of financial assistance through guaranteed loans for qualified residents of college age will enable them to attend qualified institutions of their choice.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares: That the costs of education at Colorado's public and nonpublic institutions of higher education have increased dramatically in recent years; that while the increased costs of education at public institutions have been defrayed by state support of such institutions Coloradans wishing to attend nonpublic institutions of higher education in the state face a serious financial burden; that the decline of Colorado's nonpublic institutions of higher education due to an absence of students able to bear the costs of education would increase the number of students seeking admission to state-funded institutions; and that the preservation of Colorado's traditional diversity in higher education and access to a variety of educational opportunities for Coloradans of all backgrounds and resources require that the general assembly act to assist in-state students in meeting the increased costs of education at Colorado's nonpublic institutions of higher education.

        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar3.9-p01-s23-3.9-100.2ol11a">
         Colorado suffers from a shortage of teachers and other educators due to various factors affecting the teaching profession, which include but are not limited to declining enrollment and completion of educator preparation programs, low educator compensation and benefits, an insufficient number of educators in certain content areas, and difficulty in filling educator positions in rural or isolated areas of the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar3.9-p01-s23-3.9-100.2ol11b">
         Pursuant to House Bill 17-1003, enacted in 2017, the department of higher education and the department of education, with input from education and community stakeholders, analyzed teacher and other educator shortages and issued a report including recommendations for addressing these shortages;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar3.9-p01-s23-3.9-100.2ol11c">
         As part of their findings, the department of higher education and the department of education determined that the state has educator shortages in early childhood education; science; mathematics; world languages; special education; and art, music, and drama;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar3.9-p01-s23-3.9-100.2ol11d">
         Further, shortages in these content areas are more pronounced in rural and remote rural areas where school districts and rural schools face additional challenges, including inadequate teacher compensation, lack of affordable housing, and an inability to attract new teachers to rural communities; and
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar3.9-p01-s23-3.9-100.2ol11e">
         The department of higher education and the department of education found that one strategy for addressing teacher and other educator shortages in hard-to-fill positions due to teaching content area or geographic location is to offer loan repayment of educational loans for educators who serve in these hard-to-fill positions in the state.

      </li>
      <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar3.9-p01-s23-3.9-100.2ol12">
       Therefore, the general assembly declares that implementing a loan forgiveness program for educators employed in qualified positions in the state is necessary to ensure that the needs of students are met in all Colorado public schools.

       The general assembly finds that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar4.5-s23-4.5-101ol11a">
         Student expenditures on textbooks and other educational materials represent a significant portion of student educational costs, adding up to, on average, an additional twenty-two percent above the cost of tuition and fees for a first-year community college student. Research concerning the use of open educational resources indicates the use of these resources results in significant savings for students.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar4.5-s23-4.5-101ol11b">
         Research also indicates that, because of the cost of textbooks and other materials, students often do not buy textbooks or course materials, resulting in poor academic performance, including failing course grades. Other studies indicate that students take fewer courses or drop courses because of the cost of textbooks and materials, extending the time to graduation.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar4.5-s23-4.5-101ol11c">
         Several institutions of higher education across the country have begun participating in open educational resources consortia that make textbooks, course activities, and readings available to students online for no cost, resulting in significant student savings. States and institutions are also beginning to offer entire courses, sections, and even degrees that are branded as having zero textbook costs.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar4.5-s23-4.5-101ol12">
       The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is appropriate to establish the Colorado open educational resources council to recommend statewide policies concerning promoting the use of open educational resources, facilitate knowledge sharing and professional development to increase and support the statewide use of open educational resources, and implement a statewide grant program for public institutions of higher education, faculty, and staff to create and expand the use of open educational resources.

       Any auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities with similar functions which is managed by the governing body of an institution of higher education or by the board of directors of the Auraria higher education center may be designated as an enterprise for the purposes of section 20 of article X of the state constitution so long as the governing body of the institution of higher education or the board of directors of the Auraria higher education center, whichever manages such auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities, retains the authority to issue revenue bonds on behalf of such auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities and such auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities receives less than ten percent of its total annual revenues in grants from all Colorado state and local governments combined. The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, for the purposes of determining whether an auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities may be designated as an enterprise, it is sufficient that the governing body of an institution of higher education or the board of directors of the Auraria higher education center, whichever manages such auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities, has authority to issue revenue bonds on behalf of such auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities. So long as it is designated as an enterprise pursuant to the provisions of this section, an auxiliary facility or group of auxiliary facilities shall not be subject to any of the provisions of section 20 of article X of the state constitution.

This subsection (2) shall not apply when the gift has been approved by the Colorado commission on higher education with the understanding that acceptance will require an allocation of state funding and the commission is satisfied that provision therefor can be made within available resources. The commission shall prepare a statement of procedures of review and of criteria to be applied in its review of any such gifts, which shall have the approval of the governor and joint budget committee.

If the entity is entirely separate and apart from the institution, if no employees of the institution serve as staff or as voting members of the entity's board, and if the funds and accounts of the entity are entirely separate from those of the institution, such gifts and bequests are subject to annual audit to be performed by an independent accounting firm engaged by the entity if determined in advance to be satisfactory to the legislative audit committee. The state auditor shall have access to all of the accountant's work papers. If, alternatively, the separate relationship does not prevail, members and employees of the board of the entity may include staff members or employees of the institution, and such gifts and bequests are subject to audit by the state auditor or the state auditor's designee.

       The general assembly hereby recognizes the necessity of maintaining a high caliber of faculty within the state system of higher education and the importance of the faculty's contribution in delivering quality education within the state system of higher education. The general assembly recognizes that faculty sabbaticals play an important role in developing and enhancing faculty expertise, thereby supporting faculty excellence in teaching and research. The general assembly also recognizes that a faculty sabbatical is a privilege, rather than a right, and should be granted only when it results in adding value to the institution, the students' education, and the state. The general assembly therefore declares that state-supported institutions of higher education should judiciously grant faculty sabbaticals that will improve excellence within the state system of higher education and will thereby benefit the state.

        Classification of students as out-of-state and consequent imposition of higher tuition is not unconstitutional.
       </b>
       It is not unconstitutional to classify students applying for admission to a university as in-state or out-of-state students, and to impose a higher tuition for the out-of-state students. Landwehr v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., 156

        Fundamental to the classification of "in-state student" is the establishment of a domicile
       </b>
       as it is expressly defined in subsection (2). Seren v. Douglas, 30

        Intent as to domicile is to be determined by trier of fact, absent legal disability.
       </b>
       In the absence of a legal disability preventing a student admitted to the United States as an alien from forming the requisite intent to establish a domicile after the expiration of his student visa, it is within the province of the trier of act to determine whether the intent required by this section was present. Seren v. Douglas, 30
       <cite class="cocode">

       <b>
        Although the federal statutes create a disability during the period
       </b>
       that a student is a nonimmigrant alien, no state or federal statute compels the conclusion that this impediment remains until he is granted the status of lawful permanent resident. Seren v. Douglas, 30
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. App. 110, 489 P.2d 601

       <b>
        The legal disability created by federal statute can, as a matter of fact and law, dissolve
       </b>
       upon the expiration of an alien student's visa, and at such time he can abandon his legal intent to return to his homeland and seek status as a permanent resident of the United States. Seren v. Douglas, 30
       <cite class="cocode">

        Colorado, the trial court did not err in finding that he met the requirements for the establishment of a "domicile" as expressly defined by subsection (2); and where the trial court additionally found that plaintiff had been domiciled in Colorado for more than one year prior to his application for resident tuition status, its conclusion that the student was entitled to classification as an "in-state student" for tuition purposes under subsection (5) was also proper.

Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (2) to the contrary, in the case of short-term notes or other obligations maturing not later than one year from the date of issuance thereof, the board may authorize the executive director, associate executive director, or any officer of the board to fix principal amounts, maturity dates, interest rates, and purchase prices of any particular issue of such short-term notes or obligations, subject to such limitations as to maximum term, maximum principal amount outstanding, and maximum net effective interest rates as the board shall prescribe by resolution, and such authorization shall remain effective for the period of time designated in the initial resolution regardless of whether the composition of the board changes in the interim unless sooner rescinded by the board.

The proceeds of any such bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds may be applied, in the discretion of the authority, to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof and, pending such application, may be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the authority. Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested or deposited in securities or depositories meeting the requirements established in part 6 of article 75 of title 24, C.R.S., maturing at such time or times as are appropriate to assure the prompt payment as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds to be so refunded.

The portion of the proceeds of any such bonds issued for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions, or enlargements of a facility may be invested or deposited in securities or depositories meeting the requirements established in part 6 of article 75 of title 24, C.R.S., maturing not later than the time or times when such proceeds will be needed for the purpose of paying all or any part of such cost. The interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on such investment may be applied to the payment of all or any part of such cost or may be used by the authority in any lawful manner. All such bonds shall be subject to the provisions of this article in the same manner and to the same extent as other bonds issued pursuant to this article.

      In the discretion of the authority, any bonds issued pursuant to this article may be secured by a trust agreement between the authority and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company in Colorado. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received or the proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged and may convey or mortgage the facilities or any portion thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable, proper, and not in violation of law, including particularly such provisions as have been specifically authorized to be included in any resolution or resolutions of the authority authorizing bonds thereof. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a facility.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds that dishonest or unscrupulous practices by athlete agents who solicit representation of student athletes can cause significant harm to student athletes and to the institutions of higher education for which they play. It is the general assembly's intent to protect the interests of student athletes and institutions of higher education by limiting the contacts between athlete agents and student athletes and by setting requirements for contracts entered into between athlete agents and student athletes.

       There is created in the department of higher education the college opportunity fund program, which is administered by the Colorado student loan program. On and after July 1, 2015, the Colorado student loan program may enter into an agreement with the department or another state entity to administer all or part of the college opportunity fund program. The college opportunity fund, created in section  23-18-202, is a trust fund for the benefit of eligible undergraduate students. It consists of a stipend for each undergraduate student in Colorado who applies for the stipend and who is admitted and registers to attend a state or participating private institution of higher education and is determined to be eligible by the Colorado student loan program to receive a stipend. An eligible undergraduate student may use the stipend for undergraduate courses and graduate-level courses that apply toward the student's undergraduate degree that are taken at a state or participating private institution of higher education at a fixed rate per credit hour, set annually by the general assembly.

       A student of a private institution of higher education shall be a beneficiary of the college opportunity fund and eligible to participate in the college opportunity fund program only if the private institution of higher education that the student attends has agreed to participate in the program by establishing a performance contract with the department. The performance contract shall specify the performance goals the institution shall achieve during the period that it operates under the performance contract. The department shall include each participating private institution of higher education and its students who participate in the college opportunity fund program in the student unit reporting data system, in order to enable the students of the participating private institution of higher education to participate in the program. The participating private institution of higher education shall reimburse the department for the actual expenses associated with including the institution in the student unit reporting data system.

         In order to ensure the state's ongoing social, cultural, and economic vibrancy, funding for higher education should be based on the needs of the state, the people of Colorado, and the students;

        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar18-p03-s23-18-301ol11c">
         Colorado ranks highly in the United States in the percentage of its citizens between the ages of twenty-five and sixty-four with a college degree, largely due to the migration of college-educated adults from other states and countries;

         In order to ensure that Colorado students have access to a postsecondary education that will allow them to compete for jobs in Colorado's increasingly high-tech economy and the global economy, it is essential that Colorado make wise use of its investment in higher education to increase the number of Coloradans who have earned a high-quality postsecondary credential;

        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar18-p03-s23-18-301ol11e">
         It is important that the state of Colorado ensures that all Coloradans have access to affordable higher education, regardless of income, race, gender, age, or academic preparation, and that higher education services are available in all geographic areas of the state, including rural areas, historically underserved areas, and areas with low educational attainment;

         <p id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar18-p03-s23-18-301ol11f-f.5">
          (f.5) As part of an affordable higher education, the Colorado commission on higher education should ensure that institutions provide realistic opportunities for students to shorten their time to degree, when appropriate, while also recognizing the challenges that some students face as they work or take care of and support their families while striving to avoid accumulating student debt; and

         Colorado's limited state resources must be used in a way that provides incentives for state institutions of higher education to achieve the policy goals adopted by the general assembly and identified in the Colorado commission on higher education's master plan.

        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar18-p03-s23-18-301ol12b">
         These goals can be accomplished by the general assembly establishing performance funding metrics that are consistent, predictable, and focused on improved performance;

        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar18-p03-s23-18-301ol12c">
         With a consistent and predictable funding model for higher education, state institutions of higher education will be able to engage in long-term financial planning that will benefit students through more predictable tuition and fees; and

       For the 2015-16 state fiscal year through the 2020-21 state fiscal year, the governing board of a state institution of higher education may annually negotiate a fee-for-service contract with the department pursuant to this section for the delivery of higher education services by the institution for the benefit of the state and its residents. Specialty education programs, area technical colleges, and local district colleges are funded pursuant to the provisions of section  23-18-304.

       Role and mission funding.
    
    The institutional role and mission component of the fee-for-service contract is based on the following factors, as determined by the commission pursuant to section  23-18-306:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar18-p03-s23-18-303ol13a">
         Institutional mission.
    
    Role and mission funding must include an amount for each governing board to offset the costs incurred in providing undergraduate programs at each institution. In establishing the components of this factor, the commission shall include, at a minimum:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar18-p03-s23-18-303ol13aI">

    Role and mission funding must include an amount for each governing board to offset the costs incurred in providing additional support services to Pell-eligible undergraduate students enrolled in the institution. The amount of funding for support services for each Pell-eligible undergraduate student enrolled in the institution must be at least equal to ten percent of the amount of the college opportunity fund stipend, as set by the general assembly pursuant to section  23-18-202, for the applicable state fiscal year. The commission may include an amount for each governing board to offset the costs incurred in providing support services to first-generation undergraduate students enrolled in the institution after the commission establishes, in consultation with the institutions, a consistent definition and data collection method for identifying this student population. The commission may also include an amount for each governing board to offset the costs incurred in providing support services to undergraduate students who are identified as underserved after the commission establishes, in consultation with the institutions, a consistent definition and data collection method for identifying underserved students.

In establishing the components of this factor, the commission shall determine how to measure successful remediation, which measure may include a student's successful completion of a first-level college course in the area of remediation, including English or math. The commission may also include components relating to the speed of a student's remediation and the cost of remediation to the student.

The commission shall establish the amount awarded for each type of credential based on the subject and level of the credential and, for transfers from community colleges, and the amount awarded and, in consultation with the institutions, the number of credit hours to be completed prior to transfer. The commission shall increase the value of each credential earned by or transfer completed by a Pell-eligible undergraduate student and may increase the value of each credential earned or transfer completed by a first-generation or underserved undergraduate student if the commission implements increased funding for these student populations pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of this section.

In establishing the components of this metric, the commission may include a component related to an increase in the institution's retention rate. A community college that receives a completion incentive for a transferring student is not eligible for a retention bonus for that student in the same year.

           If the commission recommends additional funding for an institution or institutions pursuant to this subsection (2)(b), funding is calculated for an institution by dividing the institution's resident first-generation undergraduate student head count, based on the most recent census data collected by the department pursuant to section  23-18-302 (12)(b), by the institution's overall resident undergraduate student population head count from the fall census, and then multiplying the quotient by the institution's resident first-generation undergraduate student head count, resulting in the institution's "calibrated first-generation undergraduate student head count". An institution's percentage share of additional funding pursuant to this subsection (2)(b) is then determined by dividing the institution's calibrated first-generation undergraduate student head count by the sum of the calibrated first-generation undergraduate student head counts for all institutions that receive additional funding pursuant to this subsection (2)(b).

The rate of change for each performance funding metric is calculated annually for a governing board by dividing the average of the four most recent years of actual data reported by the governing board for the metric by the average of the three oldest of the four years of actual data reported by the governing board for the metric. The rate of change for the performance funding metric is then multiplied by each governing board's role and mission share, resulting in the "governing board role and mission adjusted share" for the performance funding metric. The total of the governing board role and mission adjusted shares for all governing boards is the "total role and mission adjusted share" for the performance funding metric. Each governing board's allocation for the performance funding metric is then determined by dividing the governing board's role and mission adjusted share for the performance funding metric by the total role and mission adjusted share for the performance funding metric, ensuring that the total amount of funding distributed through the performance funding metric does not exceed the amount of funding allocated for the performance funding metric.

       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar19.7-s23-19.7-101ol11a">
         During the peer review process for awarding federally sponsored research projects, the federal government often requires project applicants to provide state matching moneys or gives preference to applicants that demonstrate an ability to provide such moneys.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar19.7-s23-19.7-101ol11b">
         Colorado, unlike many other states, does not have a dedicated source of matching moneys for federally sponsored research projects.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar19.7-s23-19.7-101ol11c">
         Federal requirements and preferences for state matching moneys disadvantage Colorado public universities when competing against universities in other states that can access dedicated sources of state matching moneys.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-generalandadministrative-ar19.7-s23-19.7-101ol11d">
         It is therefore necessary and appropriate for the state to provide a dedicated source of matching moneys that will allow Colorado public universities to compete on equal footing with out-of-state universities when applying for federally sponsored research projects and to create an authority to oversee the use of the matching moneys.

       Editor's note:
      </b>
      This section was amended in House Bill No. 1143, enacted by the General Assembly at its first regular session in 1989, as a conforming amendment necessitated by the authorization for the operation of the university of Colorado university hospital by a nonprofit-nonstock corporation. The Colorado Supreme Court subsequently declared House Bill No. 1143 unconstitutional in its entirety. See
    804 P.2d 138 (Colo. 1990). Senate Bill 91-225, enacted by the General Assembly at its first regular session in 1991, authorized the operation of university hospital by a newly created university of Colorado hospital authority. Since the previous act was declared unconstitutional in its entirety, the General Assembly elected to make a similar conforming amendment to this section in Senate Bill 91-225. For further explanation of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of Senate Bill 91-225, see the legislative declaration contained in section 1 of chapter 99, Session Laws of Colorado 1991.

        This part 1 was repealed in House Bill 89-1143, enacted by the General Assembly at its first regular session in 1989, as a conforming amendment necessitated by the authorization for the operation of the university ofColorado university hospital by a nonprofit-nonstock corporation. The Colorado Supreme Court subsequently declared House Bill 89-1143 unconstitutional in its entirety. See Colorado Association of Public Employees v. Board of Regents, 804 P.2d 138 (Colo. 1990). Senate Bill 91-225, enacted by the General Assembly at its first regular session in 1991, authorized the operation of university hospital by a newly created university of Colorado hospital authority. Since the previous act was declared unconstitutional in its entirety, the General Assembly elected to make a similar conforming amendment to this part 1 in Senate Bill 91-225. For further explanation of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of Senate Bill 91-225, see the legislative declaration contained in section 1 of chapter 99, Session Laws of Colorado 1991.

The Colorado Supreme Court subsequently declared House Bill 89-1143 unconstitutional in its entirety. See Colorado Association of Public Employees v. Board of Regents, 804 P.2d 138 (Colo. 1990). Senate Bill 91-225, enacted by the General Assembly at its first regular session in 1991, authorized the operation of university hospital by a newly created university of Colorado hospital authority. Since the previous act was declared unconstitutional in its entirety, the General Assembly elected to repeal this part 4 in Senate Bill 91-225.

       Editor's note:
      </b>
      This section was amended in House Bill 89-1143, enacted by the General Assembly at its first regular session in 1989, as a conforming amendment necessitated by the authorization for the operation of the university of Colorado university hospital by a nonprofit-nonstock corporation. The Colorado Supreme Court subsequently declared House Bill 89-1143 unconstitutional in its entirety. See
    804 P.2d 138 (Colo. 1990). Senate Bill 91-225, enacted by the General Assembly at its first regular session in 1991, authorized the operation of university hospital by a newly created university of Colorado hospital authority. Since the previous act was declared unconstitutional in its entirety, the General Assembly elected to make a similar conforming amendment to this section in Senate Bill 91-225. For further explanation of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of Senate Bill 91-225, see the legislative declaration contained in section 1 of chapter 99, Session Laws of Colorado 1991.

       The hospital is primarily and principally conducted, not for chronic illness, but for the care and treatment of legal residents of Colorado who are afflicted with a behavioral or mental health disorder that can probably be remedied by observation, treatment, and hospital care. The hospital must also be utilized for such instruction and for such scientific research as, in the opinion of the board of regents, will promote the welfare of the patients committed or certified to its care and assist in the application of science to the prevention and cure of behavioral or mental health disorders.

       Persons eligible to admission to said hospital as patients shall belong to one of the following classes: First, voluntary public patients; second, committed public patients; third, voluntary private patients; fourth, committed private patients; fifth, part pay patients, either voluntary or committed.

      <li id="t23-stateuniversitiesandcolleges-ar22-s23-22-107ol13">
       A voluntary public patient is one who is admitted to the hospital at his own request or at the request of the person who has lawful custody or control over him. A committed patient is one who is ordered by the court to submit to observation, care, and treatment at the hospital. A private patient is one whose entire expenses at the hospital are paid by himself, out of his estate, by those responsible for his support, or by some person who voluntarily assumes the expense. A public patient is one whose entire expense at the hospital is paid out of the psychiatric hospital fund. A part pay patient is one whose expense is paid in part out of the psychiatric hospital fund, and the remainder is paid by himself, out of his estate, by those legally responsible for his support, or by someone who voluntarily assumes the expense.

       The board of governors of the Colorado state university system, designated in this section as the "board", is authorized to enter into contracts for the advancement of moneys for the construction and acquisition of facilities or equipment, or both, for the Colorado state university veterinary medicine hospital, or any part thereof, and, in connection with or as a part of such contracts, to pledge revenues from a special hospital fee that the board shall collect pursuant to agreements entered into with or with respect to each accountable student as security for the repayment of the moneys advanced therefor, together with interest thereon. The maximum number of accountable students at any given time shall not exceed three hundred eight; except that, should the total enrollment in the professional veterinary medicine program exceed five hundred forty-eight head-count students, additional accountable students may not exceed forty-five percent of each admitted class. For purposes of this section, an "accountable student" is a person who, as of the date of his or her selection for admission into the professional veterinary medicine program, is not receiving funding, either from the state of Colorado or from a state that has entered into a cooperative agreement with the state of Colorado pursuant to section  24-60-601, C.R.S., for all or any portion of the costs incurred in participating in the professional veterinary medicine program. An agreement shall be entered into with or with respect to each accountable student, and each such agreement shall provide that, as a condition to that student's continued enrollment in the professional veterinary medicine program, there shall be paid annually by or on behalf of the student the special hospital fee provided for in this section, which fee shall be fixed by the board annually in an amount sufficient to meet the obligation authorized by this section.

       The board shall annually assess each cooperative state or accountable student a support fee to reimburse Colorado for instructional costs. This support fee includes an equipment and renovation fee of one thousand one dollars assessed to each cooperative state or accountable student for acquisition or replacement of equipment and for renovation. Colorado shall share proportionately in the acquisition or replacement of equipment and renovation projects. The amount to be paid by Colorado shall be determined by the annual ratio of Colorado students to accountable students based upon beginning enrollment of each school year. The fee required to be collected pursuant to this subsection (2) is based on a student's status as an "accountable student" at the time of selection for admission into the professional veterinary medicine program and shall not be reduced or waived regardless of the student's status as an in-state student, pursuant to the provisions of section  23-7-103, at any time during the student's participation in the professional veterinary medicine program.

       Any advancement of moneys, not to exceed two million five hundred thousand dollars, may be evidenced by revenue bonds or anticipation warrants to be executed by the board for and on behalf of Colorado state university and containing such terms and provisions, including provisions for adequate reserves and for redemption prior to maturity and a maximum net effective interest rate, as may be determined by the board. Such revenue bonds or anticipation warrants shall bear interest at a rate such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds or anticipation warrants does not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate fixed, which interest shall be payable semiannually or annually. Such revenue bonds or warrants may be sold at less than par, but they may not be sold at a price such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds or warrants exceeds the maximum net effective interest rate fixed. Any such revenue bonds or warrants may be refunded pursuant to article 54 of title 11, C.R.S., if in the judgment of the board such refunding is to the best interests of the university.

       If the sources of pledged revenues described in subsection (1) of this section exceed the amount required for the amortization of any advancement made pursuant to this section, and the payment of interest thereof, together with reserve requirements, the board may apply such surplus to the redemption of such securities prior to maturity of such securities according to redemption provisions thereof, or such surplus may be used by the board for the purposes of maintaining, repairing, altering, or adding to any existing equipment or facilities acquired pursuant to the provisions of this section for any lawful purpose.

       No action shall be brought questioning the legality of any contract, proceedings, revenue bonds, or anticipation warrants issued or to be issued by the board in connection with the provision of all or any part of the Colorado state university veterinary medicine hospital pursuant to this section after the expiration of thirty days from the effective date of any resolution or other official action authorizing such contract, adopting such proceedings, or authorizing the issuance of such warrants or bonds.

       Grant projects.
    
    The forest service shall issue a statewide request for proposals for cost-share grants for projects that are designed through a collaborative community process. The projects may be entirely on, or on any combination of, private, state, county, or municipal forest lands. The grant share of an individual project cost must not exceed fifty percent of the total cost of the project or exceed one million dollars per project. In the case of a project that is located in an area with fewer economic resources, the grant share of an individual project cost must not exceed seventy-five percent of the total cost of the project or exceed one million dollars per project. The remaining portion of the project's funding may be in the form of cash, stumpage, or in-kind contribution. In meeting the match requirements under this subsection (3), a project may be funded, in whole or in part, from gifts, grants, or donations received from any organization, entity, or individual. In measuring an in-kind contribution for purposes of meeting the fifty percent and twenty-five percent matches required by this subsection (3), "in-kind contribution" may include volunteer hours provided by the staff of an entity or organization applying for grant funding and the time for which staff receives monetary compensation in the form of salary or other financial benefits. Such compensated time that counts toward the in-kind contribution is limited to the estimated time of paid staff in planning and implementing the mitigation project. The forest service shall establish a policy that specifies the criteria by which a particular project will satisfy the requirement of this subsection (3) that it is located in an area with fewer economic resources, as applicable.

           Community wildfire protection plans, or CWPPs, are authorized and defined in section 101 of Title I of the federal "Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003", Pub.L. 108-148, referred to in this section as "HFRA". Title I of HFRA authorizes the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to expedite the development and implementation of hazardous fuel reduction projects on federal lands managed by the United States forest service and the bureau of land management when these agencies meet certain conditions. HFRA emphasizes the need for federal agencies to work collaboratively with local communities in developing hazardous fuel reduction projects, placing priority on treatment areas identified by the local communities themselves in a CWPP. The wildland-urban interface area is one of the identified property areas that qualify under HFRA for the use of this expedited environmental review process.

           The development of a CWPP can assist a local community in clarifying and refining its priorities for the protection of life, property, and critical infrastructure in its wildland-urban interface area. The CWPP brings together diverse federal, state, and local interests to discuss their mutual concerns for public safety, community sustainability, and natural resources. The CWPP process offers a positive, solution-oriented environment in which to address challenges such as local fire-fighting capability, the need for defensible space around homes and housing developments, the effect of fire ratings and combustibility standards for building materials used in wildland-urban interface areas, and where and how to prioritize land management on both federal and nonfederal lands. CWPPs can be as simple or complex as a local community desires.

         The national western center master plan provides for an integrated facilities program that includes a variety of facilities for Colorado state university, including an equine sports medicine clinic, a collaborative community outreach veterinary clinic and clinical trials center, a water resources center, and a Colorado state university center that may include: a food systems innovation and learning center; a Denver urban extension center; an educational urban farm with demonstration fields; classrooms; laboratories; a test kitchen and administrative space; and other facilities that are consistent with the national western center master plan vision and guiding principles that may be added as the site develops. In addition, the national western center needs support from and integration with Colorado state university's on-campus programs that support the national western center vision and proposed activities, including teaching, research, and outreach.

         In September 2009, the federal centers for disease control and prevention reported that no state in the country was meeting national goals for the amount of fruits and vegetables that Americans should be eating. As a result, the centers for disease control and prevention identified, as a first strategy, the creation of food policy councils to improve the food environment and economies at the local, regional, and state levels.

         Food policy councils consist of multistakeholder organizations that employ a food systems approach that facilitates evaluation and program development at every stage of the food process from farm to table. By 2016, there were over two hundred twenty food policy councils throughout the United States addressing issues such as healthy food access, economic development, and food procurement. Colorado's food systems advisory council, which was created in 2010, has focused primarily on strengthening healthy food access for all Coloradans through the growth of Colorado agriculture and local food systems and economies.

       It belongs to the faculty, by whom the instruction is imparted, to say whether a student possesses the proper qualifications to entitle him to a diploma. Steinhauer v. Arkins, 18 Colo. App. 49, 69 P. 1075 (1902).

       </b>
       The board of trustees of the school of mines has no authority to issue a diploma to a student of the school except when required to do so by the school speaking through its faculty, and thus mandamus will not lie to compel the board of trustees to issue such diploma where the student has failed to pass the examination required by the faculty, although his failure may have been chargeable to the hostility and wrongful conduct of the faculty.

        The provisions of this part 2 concerning the Grand Junction School were repealed in 1982. The following is an historical narrative of the property that was the subject of this part 2: The property originally known as the Grand Junction Indian School was granted to the state for educational purposes by the federal congress in 1910; see 36 Stat. 1910, p. 273. A school of horticulture, forestry, and vocational learning was established there in 1911; seeL. 11, p. 145, ยง 1. In 1916 a change of use was authorized, allowing the state to use the property for the care of the insane, for an agricultural experiment station, or for other public purposes; see 39 Stat. 1916, p. 128. A state home and training school for mental defectives was then established on the property in 1919; see legislative history of ยง  27-14-109 prior to its repeal byL. 83, p. 1161, ยง 23.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the state board for community colleges and occupational education is charged to develop and establish state policy for occupational education and to govern the state system of community colleges. The board shall be responsible for the establishment of statewide career and technical education policy for all the entities which provide such education and shall coordinate all aspects of career and technical education in the state to assure quality programming and efficient delivery of such education.

       In its role as the governing authority for the state system of community colleges, the board shall assure a system of two-year program delivery throughout the state coordinated, where appropriate, with the local district colleges. In order to assist the board in carrying out its responsibilities, the general assembly hereby provides for the establishment of local councils to advise the board on the operation of individual community and local district colleges from a local perspective.

       The function of the two-year college system is to conduct occupational, technical, and community service programs with no term limitations and general education, including college transfer programs with unrestricted admissions. It is further the intent of this article to develop appropriate occupational education and adult education programs in these and other postsecondary educational institutions, to maintain and expand occupational education programs in the elementary and secondary schools of the state permitting local school districts already having area technical colleges to continue to operate them, and to develop work study and on-the-job training programs designed to acquaint youth with the world of work and to train and retrain youth and adults for employment. The general assembly intends that state agencies concerned with occupational education in the public schools shall cooperate with the board in planning and implementing occupational education programs, to the end that the state of Colorado has complete and well-balanced occupational and adult education programs available to the people of Colorado at all educational levels.

       or authority upon the state board to act on behalf of the federal government as a "state approving agency" for approval or nonapproval of courses offered to veterans, in the absence of enabling act conferring such power and authority upon the governor and the state board, the actions of the governor and the state board was a nullity.

        Any laws and regulations that would operate in contravention of the constitutional underpinnings of the state board for community colleges and occupational education and the state land board and their constitutionally and statutorily conferred duties and powers

       must necessarily evidence a "clear and unmistakable" intent on the part of the general assembly to repeal the conflicting special statutory and constitutional provisions. City of Littleton v. State, 832 P.2d 985 (Colo. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the laws and regulations have an impact on the lands held by the state land board, the legislative scheme must neither create a body with authority equivalent to that vested in the board nor create a situation which results in the diversion of revenues from the public school funds.

        The state board for community colleges and occupational education is an instrumentality of the state,

     <p>
      There is established a state system of community and technical colleges that is under the management and jurisdiction of the state board for community colleges and occupational education. The mission of the community colleges is to serve Colorado residents who reside in their service areas by offering a broad range of general, personal, career, and technical education programs, as well as bachelor of science in nursing completion programs that result in the awarding of a bachelor of science in nursing degree to successful candidates pursuant to section

      , each college must be a two-year college. Each community college may offer two-year degree programs with or without academic designation, and, upon approval of the board pursuant to section 23-60-211, may offer technical, career, and workforce development bachelor of applied science degree programs. A community college shall not impose admission requirements upon any student. Admission to a community college does not guarantee enrollment in a specific program that has prerequisites. The objects of the community and technical colleges are to provide educational programs to fill the occupational needs of youth and adults in career and technical fields, two-year transfer educational programs to qualify students for admission to the junior year at other colleges and universities, developmental education courses, workforce development, and a broad range of personal and career education for adults, and technical, career, and workforce development bachelor of applied science degree programs established pursuant to section 23-60-211, that address the needs of the community within each community college service area.

       A person claiming pecuniary loss as a result of a deceptive trade or sales practice, pursuant to section  23-64-123, by a school or agent may file with the board a written complaint against the school or agent. The complaint must set forth the alleged violation and any other relevant information as the board may require. A complaint filed under this section is a public record subject to the provisions of article 72 of title 24 and must be filed within two years after the student discontinues his or her training at the school or at any time prior to the commencement of training.

If, upon all the evidence at a hearing, the board finds that a school or agent has engaged in or is engaging in any deceptive trade or sales practice, the board may issue and cause to be served upon the school, the agent, or the designated agent for service of process, notice, or demand an order requiring the school or agent to cease and desist from such practice. The board may obtain an order for enforcement of its order in the district court pursuant to section  24-4-106.

       If the board finds that the complainant or class of complainants has suffered pecuniary loss as a result of such practice, the board, at its discretion, may award the complainant or class of complainants full restitution for the loss. The board may also commence a civil action against a school or agent believed by the board to have caused a complainant or class of complainants to suffer pecuniary loss as a result of any deceptive trade or sales practice. Upon a finding that the complainant or class of complainants has suffered pecuniary loss as a result of any deceptive trade or sales practice, the court shall order the school or agent to pay to the complainant or class of complainants full restitution for the loss.

        In order to maximize economic and administrative efficiency at the Auraria center and to further the goals articulated in section  23-1-101, the general assembly finds it necessary that there be comprehensive academic and facilities master planning for the use and development of the Auraria center constituent institutions. Therefore, the governing boards of the constituent institutions and the Auraria board, in consultation with the Colorado commission on higher education, shall prepare comprehensive master plans according to the following requirements and schedule:

The coordinated academic master plans shall address all Auraria multiinstitutional issues that the commission determines to be relevant to the role and mission of each institution and academic program requirements for fulfilling that role and mission.

         <li id="t23-educationalcentersandlocaldistrictcolleges-ar70-s23-70-115ol11b">
          The commission shall review the master plans and shall, after consultation with the governing boards, order revisions to the extent that the plans fail to maximize efficiency and academic program effectiveness. When approved by the commission, the academic master plans shall be submitted to the Auraria board which shall prepare a comprehensive facilities master plan for the Auraria constituent institutions. The facilities master plan shall be submitted to the commission at a date to be established by the commission.

       Any local college district desiring to become a part of the state system shall use the following procedures: The local district college board of trustees of the district shall submit to the board a plan of dissolution, together with a detailed report of the finances and programs of the existing local district college. The plan of dissolution shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the board. The plan shall provide for the transfer of district assets to the board and shall make provision for meeting all liabilities of the district through assumption by the board or by other lawful means which will not impair existing obligations of contract. Liabilities to be assumed by the board shall include all revenue bonds and other special obligations which by their terms are not payable from revenues derived from ad valorem taxes of the district (such obligations being sometimes collectively designated in this article as "revenue bonds"). The revenue bonds shall continue to be payable from the revenues designated therein and shall not become the general obligation of the board or of the state of Colorado. In each case where there exist outstanding general liabilities at the time of dissolution, the plan shall provide for continuing the tax levy within the boundaries of the dissolved district as may be necessary to retire all general liabilities, including without limitation all general obligation bonded indebtedness, both principal and interest. It is the intention of this part 2 that the general assembly will make timely appropriations for the retirement, and, to the extent moneys are thereby made legally available, the levy shall be diminished or eliminated. Notwithstanding any other provision of this part 2, no local college district shall be dissolved pursuant to this part 2 if, subsequent to May 27, 1967, it has incurred liabilities (evidenced by other than revenue bonds) for capital improvements without the approval of the board prior to the incurrence unless the liabilities have been fully paid as to principal and interest before the dissolution. The plan shall include a timetable for dissolution of the district and estimates of potential enrollment and operating and capital expenditures for a period of five years after dissolution. The date of dissolution and entry into the state system shall be the first day of July immediately following the survey of the dissolution election returns.

        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar75-s23-75-102ol11c">
         Offering higher education options to students with intellectual and developmental disabilities allows these students to have all of the rights, responsibilities, privileges, benefits, and outcomes that result from a college experience to the greatest extent possible, including academic access, career development, campus engagement, self-determination, participation in paid work experiences, on-campus or off-campus living, inclusive social activities, and access to and instruction in technology;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar75-s23-75-102ol11d">
         The development of an inclusive higher education program for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities allows a student to attend an institution of higher education, pay tuition, and have access to undergraduate courses that support the student's desired outcomes and job aspirations;

        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar75-s23-75-102ol11e">
         While forty-seven states offer opportunities for higher education for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities across two hundred fifty-three institutions of higher education, Colorado does not have an institution-approved inclusive higher education program accessible to students throughout the state;

        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar75-s23-75-102ol11g">
         High-quality inclusive college programs across the country are reporting competitive job placement rates at over seventy percent within six months of graduation for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, compared to a competitive job placement rate of less than thirty percent for students without access to these types of programs, as reported in a national study conducted by the Gallup Poll and the Special Olympics. Placement in competitive jobs results in greater community participation and less dependence on government and family support.

     <ol>
      <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar76-s23-76-101ol11">
       The general assembly finds that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar76-s23-76-101ol11a">
         Teachers have a great impact on student achievement. Evidence shows that the quality of teachers can account for the majority of variances in student learning and test scores.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar76-s23-76-101ol11b">
         The teaching and learning conditions under which teachers practice their profession, though often overlooked, are essential elements to student achievement and retention. These conditions must be systematically studied and addressed for Colorado to develop a critical mass of teachers who are well prepared to teach and who will remain in hardest-to-staff schools long enough to make a significant difference for students and their families.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar76-s23-76-101ol11c">
         Research demonstrates that the negative effects of shortages of teachers and special services providers, as well as distribution challenges, have a disproportionate impact on geographic areas of the state that are classified as "rural". As a result, children in rural areas are more likely to be taught by fewer teachers who must cover an increasingly larger number of subjects and have limited access to critical support services offered by special services providers.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar76-s23-76-101ol11d">
         Approved alternative teacher preparation programs are critical for filling teacher shortages in rural schools and school districts across Colorado. Rural school leaders are able to place qualified teacher candidates, including members of their own communities, in classrooms through these alternative teacher preparation programs. Such programs provide the necessary support and coaching to an individual during his or her year-long training and allow alternative teacher candidates to earn initial teacher licensure while serving in classrooms. By helping to fill immediate needs in hard-to-staff rural schools and school districts, and by receiving the necessary training, alternative teacher candidates are able to create a positive, longitudinal impact on students and their families.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar76-s23-76-101ol11e">
         Since the beginning of alternative teacher preparation pathways in Colorado, the number of alternative teacher candidates has increased steadily, with one out of every four alternative teacher candidates now completing an alternative teacher preparation program.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar76-s23-76-101ol12">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that, for purposes of section 17 of article IX of the state constitution, implementation of measures designed to improve the quality, recruitment, and retention of teachers and special services providers in the rural areas of Colorado through this article 76 is a critical element of accountable education reform, accountable programs to meet state academic standards, and performance incentives for teachers and special services providers and, therefore, may receive funding from the state education fund created in section 17 (4) of article IX of the state constitution.

       The general assembly finds that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol11a">
         The state is committed to increasing the number of students who graduate from a Colorado high school, enroll in a Colorado institution of higher education, and graduate with a postsecondary credential in two to four academic years;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol11b">
         Several states have implemented a summer residential education program for high school students who demonstrate exceptional intellectual curiosity, creativity, and maturity. While participating in the summer program, students attend classes, lectures, seminars, concerts, art exhibits, theatrical performances, and films and have the opportunity to learn independently and from distinguished faculty, staff members, and guest lecturers.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol11c">
         The summer residential education programs implemented in other states have:

          <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol11cI">

          </li>
          <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol11cIV">
           Motivated students to remain in their home states for their postsecondary education and careers; and

         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol11d">
         A high percentage of the students who have participated in the summer residential education programs have subsequently enrolled in postsecondary education in their home states and earned a baccalaureate degree in four years.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol12">
       The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is in the best interests of the state to establish the Colorado student leaders institute as a pilot program using the model of summer residential education programs implemented in other states and to appropriate state money to ensure the successful operations of the institute for the benefit of Colorado high school students.
      </li>
      <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar77-s23-77-101ol13">
       The general assembly further finds that, for purposes of section 17 of article IX of the state constitution, the Colorado student leaders institute is an accountable program that assists students in meeting state academic standards and may therefore receive funding from the state education fund created in section 17 (4) of article IX of the state constitution.

         High-quality teaching is the linchpin for effective, high-quality education in the schools of the state. To be an excellent, effective educator, an individual must receive comprehensive, rigorous, and effective training in the art and science of teaching and in the skills and subjects that the individual will teach.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar78-p01-s23-78-102ol11b">
         Local education providers who hire teachers who have not completed an adequate preparation program, including high-quality clinical practice, are likely to experience a high turnover rate because new teachers who are not well trained leave the profession in their first year of teaching at more than twice the rate of those who have had clinical practice and rigorous preparation;
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar78-p01-s23-78-102ol11c">
         Student achievement is likely to suffer when teachers are not well prepared for the challenges of the classroom and when teachers do not remain on the job for more than one or two years. In addition, schools with high teacher turnover rates struggle to make long-term improvement.
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar78-p01-s23-78-102ol11d">
         Research suggests that an effective teacher preparation program should include opportunities for teacher candidates to spend time in the classroom beginning in the first year of the program and continuing and increasing throughout the program, culminating in a full year of clinical practice using a classroom residency model in the final year of the program; and
        </li>
        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar78-p01-s23-78-102ol11e">
         To be effective, clinical practice must be directed and mentored by an experienced, high-quality master teacher who devotes significant time to working with the teacher candidate. These master teachers should receive training for the role of mentor teacher that results in a license endorsement as well as meaningful compensation for the time spent working with a teacher candidate and sufficient time within the daily work schedule to spend with the teacher candidate.

       The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is appropriate to direct the department of education and the department of higher education to collaborate with local education providers, approved educator preparation programs, alternative teacher programs, and other interested parties to identify best practices in providing comprehensive, rigorous, and effective teacher preparation and guidelines for implementing these best practices. The general assembly further finds that it is in the best interests of the state to establish a grant program to provide funding for training and reimbursements for mentor teachers who provide guidance and oversight for teacher candidates while they participate in clinical practice.

      The general assembly finds that, after studying the teacher shortage issue in Colorado, the department of higher education and the department of education concluded that one strategy for addressing the issue is to promote collaboration among educator preparation programs, alternative teacher programs, school districts, boards of cooperative services, and public schools to facilitate more effective preparation, placement, and retention of educators. The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is appropriate to create a grant program to support educator preparation partnerships involving educator preparation programs, alternative teacher programs, school districts, boards of cooperative services, and public schools to provide targeted educator preparation initiatives that improve the quality and applicability of educator preparation and the intentional placement of newly trained educators with school districts and public schools.

        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar78-p03-s23-78-302ol11a">
         A shortage in the availability of teachers to fill teaching positions in rural local education providers is causing a significant hardship for rural local education providers;

        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar78-p03-s23-78-302ol11b">
         The shortage is due, in part, to the high rate of turnover of teachers entering and leaving the profession. Following graduation and initial employment, a high percentage of teachers leave the profession within five years.

        <li id="t23-educationalprograms-ar78-p03-s23-78-302ol11c">
         The shortage in some rural local education providers also arises because teachers, after teaching in the rural local education provider for a few years, choose to relocate to a more urban area or to an area with a lower cost of living;

A teacher who receives this level of specific preparation for employment with a specific employer is more likely to remain in the profession and thereby help to reduce the teacher shortage.

         In selecting teacher candidates to participate in a teaching fellowship program, a rural local education provider and an institution of higher education should give preference to applicants who resided within the area surrounding the rural local education provider before attending a higher education institution and are seeking the opportunity to return to the local education provider as a teacher.

       Subject to available appropriations, up to one hundred teaching fellows per year, selected as provided in subsection (2) of this section, shall receive financial assistance in the form of a stipend in the amount of ten thousand dollars disbursed during the fellowship year. As provided in section  23-78-305 (3), the teaching fellow must choose whether the stipend is awarded as state-based financial aid or as wages for employment. In either case, the stipend is awarded without regard to need and is in addition to any other financial assistance that may be available to the teaching fellow. A teaching fellow may apply the stipend to pay the costs of attendance during the year in which he or she participates in the teaching fellowship program.

       The teaching fellowship stipends shall be paid fifty percent by the department of higher education from the amount appropriated for this part 3 and fifty percent by the participating institution of higher education. An institution of higher education that participates in a teaching fellowship program shall notify the department of higher education of the enrollment of each student who enters into a teaching fellowship program. Based on the level of chronic hiring difficulty and financial need demonstrated by each participating rural local education provider, the department shall annually select up to one hundred students enrolled in teaching fellowship programs to receive the stipend and shall forward to the institution fifty percent of the amount of the stipend for each selected student. The institution shall provide the remaining fifty percent of the stipend and disburse one hundred percent of each stipend to the selected teaching fellows as provided in section  23-78-305 (2)(c).
