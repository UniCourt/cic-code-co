In holding such lands in trust, the state board of land commissioners shall permit only those uses that will protect and enhance the beauty, natural values, open space, and wildlife habitat of those lands; except that any such restrictions on use need not necessarily preclude existing uses or management practices including but not limited to mineral resources, agricultural, and grazing uses.

The state board of land commissioners shall further request in such notification that, within forty-five days after receipt of the notification, the local governing body or bodies provide comment to the state board of land commissioners on whether the selection is in accordance with the provisions of article IX of the state constitution.

If information as to agricultural and mineral resource potential is inadequate, the board shall obtain an inventory of the mineral resources potential of said land first from the Colorado geological survey, or, if the Colorado geological survey is unable to complete such inventory, from an entity of equivalent credibility. If such inventory is not completed within one year after the request by the state board of land commissioners or is not completed prior to the deadline set forth in section 10 of article IX of the state constitution, the inclusion of such land in the long-term stewardship trust may proceed.

       The general assembly may not limit commissioners' power to lease certain land.
       
       Where the land included within oil and gas leases are lands "granted to the state by the general government", they are lands over which the land commissioners have exclusive powers of disposal.

      The state board of land commissioners is authorized to join on behalf of the state in a cooperative or unit plan of development or operation for any oil, gas, or geothermal resource pool, field, or area, or for any part of any such pool, field, or area, with the United States government and its lessees or with others or with both such parties and, for that purpose, is authorized at or after the time of joining to modify and change any and all terms of the leases issued under the provisions of articles 1 to 7 of this title as mutually agreed by the lessor and lessee in any such lease, including the extension of the term of years otherwise applicable to any such lease for the full period of time such cooperative or unit plan may remain in effect, as required to conform with the terms of any such lease to such cooperative or unit plan and to facilitate the efficient and economic production of the oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the lands so affected. Any such cooperative or unit plan, including lands owned by the state, may, in the discretion of the state board of land commissioners, contain a provision whereby authority is vested in the secretary of the interior if lands of the United States are also included or in any such person, committee, or state or federal officer or agency as may be designated in the plan to alter or modify from time to time the rate of prospecting and development and the quantity and rate of production under such plan.

This amount shall be based on what the valuation for assessment of the underlying land would be if it were privately owned. These payments in lieu of taxes shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as real property taxes. If a lease commences or ends at other than the beginning of the calendar year, the payment in lieu of taxes shall be prorated for the year involved. Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of government entities to levy and collect property taxes upon privately owned improvements located upon public lands under the control of the state board of land commissioners.

        II. RESERVATION OF MINERAL RIGHTS.
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Former sales of surface rights are now valid.
        </b>
        A sale of surface rights in state lands in 1913, subsequently validated by statute, is as valid and binding as if duly authorized by statute when made. Driscoll v. State, 88 Colo. 390, 297 P. 989 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Formerly there was no authority to reserve minerals.
        </b>
        Under a former statute, where the state land board offered for public sale only the surface of certain lands, reserving the mineral, and this reservation was without authority of law, the application of the purchaser for mandamus to compel the conveyance both of the surface, and all below the surface, was denied, upon the ground that the state land board was without authority to sell the mere surface and, therefore, the whole transaction was void. Gunter v. Walpole, 65 Colo. 234, 176 P. 290 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Title had to be conveyed in fee simple.
        </b>
        Under the former statute (R.S. 1908, § 5185) which contained a provision that such patent should convey a good and sufficient title in fee simple, it was held that the board must convey the land in fee, and that there was nothing in the statute either directly or indirectly authorizing the board to encumber lands sold with any easement, exception, or reservation. Walpole v. State Bd. of Land Comm'rs, 62 Colo. 554, 163 P. 848 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A right to receive a royalty for coal mined on the land sold may be reserved without destroying the fee,
        </b>
        but a certificate of sale containing a provision that "No assignment of the said coal right shall be valid without the consent and approval of the board" conveys title less than the fee and was one the board had no power to grant under the former statute. Cronk v. Shoup, 70 Colo. 71, 197 P. 756 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Prior to this section, a purchaser of state lands received nothing by a certificate reserving mineral rights in the state.
        </b>
        If the validating act granted him any right, it was one he could waive, and when he continued to make payments on certificates of sale of surface rights after the passage of the validating act, and thereafter defaulted in his payments, his contract was subject to cancellation, his payments to forfeiture, and his rights, if any, were waived. Miller v. Limon Nat'l Bank, 88 Colo. 373, 296 P. 796 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         There is no merit to a bill to have reservation adjudged void.
        </b>
        Where, prior to this section, a purchaser of state lands bid for only the surface rights, held the certificate of purchase with a clause in it reserving mineral rights, and continued to make payments on such purchase over a period of 13 years, there is no merit in a bill seeking to have the reservation adjudged void and to compel the issuance of a patent without conveyance by the purchaser to the state of the mineral rights so reserved. Driscoll v. State Bd. of Land Comm'rs, 23 F.2d 63 (8th Cir. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under earlier law, inclusion in certificate of purchase of reservation to state of mineral rights was a mistake of law,
        
        not of fact, and did not invalidate the sale nor entitle the purchaser to recover the purchase price. Bowles v. Miller, 96

In the case of a sale, all previous payments made on account of such land shall be forfeited to the state.

       Adverse possession established.
       
       Where the right-of-way deed contains language which creates a possibility of reverter, upon termination of the use, the estate of the grantees and those claiming through them would ordinarily be terminated. However, the right of the land board to reacquire the property is subject to statutory conditions which must be complied with by the state. Thus, where plaintiffs establish prima facie color of title by successive grants which are free of condition, are in possession adverse to the state for over 20 years, and are in possession and pay taxes under color of title for over 7 years, they are entitled to a decree against the state.

         The state board of land commissioners is authorized to establish, under the jurisdiction of the director of the state board of land commissioners, a mineral section and appoint a minerals director with experience in mineral resources production, management, development, or reclamation. It is the duty of the minerals director or such director's designee or contractor to inspect all works operated under leases from the state for the production of mineral resources upon which rentals are due to the state upon a basis of a royalty upon the production therefrom, as often from time to time as the minerals director shall deem it necessary for the purpose of estimating and checking royalties therefrom, and keep such maps or other information of the workings of all such operations as will give the minerals section full information concerning the same.

       Lessees of all mineral resources lands shall be required to furnish the minerals director with copies or blueprints of all maps of underground surveys of leased land, made or authorized by such lessee, including engineer's field notes, certified to by the engineer who made the survey. The minerals director or such director's designee or contractor shall review activities related to mineral resources leases. The minerals director shall also check the royalties reported as due under such lease for the preceding month and compare the same with the surveys and other inspections made by the minerals director and shall report the result of such examination and checking to the director of the state board of land commissioners. Every mine and oil and gas operation and other works upon the lands managed by the state board of land commissioners held under lease therefrom by any person, association, partnership, or corporation shall be at all times subject to the inspection of the minerals director or such director's designee or contractor. The minerals director or the director's designee or contractor shall inspect and examine all lands held under lease from the state, providing for the payment of royalties from the production therefrom, and report to the director of the state board of land commissioners the condition of said lands and the amount of work and development done thereon by such lessees and make such recommendations relative thereto as the minerals director may deem advisable. The minerals director or such director's designee or contractor shall upon ten days notice have access during normal business hours to records and books necessary to determine the royalty due from the production and disposition of all substances produced from state trust lands, which record or book is in the possession or under the control of the lessee or the lessee's assign. If after reasonable effort the minerals director or such director's designee or contractor is unable to obtain sufficient information from the lessee or assign to determine the royalty due, the director or designee or contractor may petition the state board of land commissioners for an order which upon notice and hearing shall grant access to information, records, and books pertaining to royalties that are in the possession or under the control of any entity that purchases, distributes, processes, or transports the substance produced from the state trust land. Except as is necessary to determine and report to the board royalties due to the board, all information acquired by the director or director's designee or contractor under this subsection (2) shall be protected as confidential information and shall not be a matter of public record in the absence of a written release from the entity from which the information was obtained or until otherwise ordered by a court.

        It was the design and intention of the general assembly to clothe title by occupancy with the character of real estate.
       </b>
       Gillett v. Gaffney, 3 Colo. 351 (1877); Cooper v. Hunter, 8 Colo. App. 101, 44 P. 944 (1896).

      <p>
       <b>
        By virtue of this and the following sections, occupancy became an investive act.
       </b>
       It invested the occupant with a tenure, assertable and defensible in mode and manner, as the highest estate known to the common law. It was not, therefore, a mere "naked possession", but a legal possession under the sanction, recognition, and protection of the law. Gillett v. Gaffney, 3 Colo. 351 (1877).

       <b>
        The right to possess land is same as that of owner of fee at common law.
       </b>
       Upon the adjournment of the first general assembly, except as against the United States, and subject to be defeated by abandonment, the bona fide occupant held his lands by a tenure as secure against attack, intrusion, and disseizing, as the owner of the fee at common law and, with the exceptions named, had a title good against all the world. Gillett v. Gaffney, 3 Colo. 351 (1877).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The right to possess land is unassailable as if held by patent.
       </b>
       So long as the claimant and his assigns comply with the provisions of this and the following sections, their right to possess and enjoy the land appropriated is as unassailable, except by the general government, or persons connecting themselves with the title of general government, as if they held it by patent of the United States. Cooper v. Hunter, 8 Colo. App. 101, 44 P. 944 (1896).

        Title to such land is descendible.

       Title by occupancy of land subject to entry under the acts of congress, as town sites, must, under this and the following sections, be held to be descendible. Gillett v. Gaffney, 3 Colo. 351 (1877).

     <p>
      In case of any such land so petitioned into any irrigation district, the state board of land commissioners shall be considered in all respects as a freeholder, so long as said land remains unsold, but as soon as any of such land is sold, whether occurring prior or after the time such land is petitioned into any such irrigation district, the purchaser shall from the time of his purchase be considered as such freeholder and entitled to all the rights of a freeholder, whether or not he has completed his payments to the state board of land commissioners. In no case shall any interest or title of the state be made liable or subjected to any claim for any water tax, water assessment, or water charge by reason of the including of any of such state land in any irrigation district. All assessments or other payments for the cost of irrigating any such state land shall be paid by the lessees or purchasers thereof. In case of any lease or sale, the lessee or purchaser shall pay to the register on or before March 1 of each year, in addition to his rental or amount due on his contract of purchase, as the case may be, such an additional amount as will equal the district assessment for an equal amount of land within the district or such greater amount as the board may require, and the register shall pay such additional amounts to the proper officer authorized by law to receive payment of assessments within such district to apply on the cost of furnishing water for such state land. When the title to any such state land passes from the state, the unpaid balance of the cost of furnishing water for the same shall at once become due and payable and attach as a lien thereon and be collected as an assessment of such irrigation district, in the same manner as assessments on other lands in the district.

The state board of land commissioners has power to secure, to any such person, corporation, or irrigation district so furnishing water for the irrigation of state lands, the payment of the cost of such water rights upon such lands being leased or sold by the lessee or purchaser thereof. In no case shall the state board of land commissioners have any power to use any of the school fund, either principal or interest, for any such purpose.

If at the time of the sale the applicant pays all the costs thereof and deposits with the state board of land commissioners the additional sum of fifty dollars and declares in writing that he is so qualified and intends to purchase the lands in accordance with the terms of this article, he shall, if he is a successful bidder at said sale, be granted thirty days within which to furnish proof of his qualifications to purchase. If he, within thirty days, furnishes the proof of his qualifications in accordance with the provisions of this article, he shall be deemed to have purchased the land upon an application under the provisions of this article and shall be subject to all the benefits and limitations of an applicant under this article, and a certificate of purchase shall then issue to him. In such case he may also purchase, upon an application under this article, lands additional to those purchased at such sale sufficient to make the total value of land purchased by him, in accordance with the provisions of this article, seven thousand five hundred dollars. If proof of said bidder's qualifications is furnished as provided in this section, said sum of fifty dollars shall be applied upon the purchase price of the lands. If proof of the bidder's qualifications is not furnished within thirty days, there shall be a resale of the lands upon the signed application, and said deposit of fifty dollars shall be paid by the state board of land commissioners to the person who was the next to the highest bidder at such sale.

     <p>
      On all sales of state lands, the terms of payment shall be as follows: Not less than twenty-five percent of the purchase price shall be paid in cash at the time of the sale, and the balance shall be made payable upon an amortization plan based on interest at not less than four percent per annum and providing for the payment of semiannual installments sufficient in amount to extinguish such balance at the end of thirty-three years from date of sale; but, in cases where the total improvements on the land sold are in excess of forty percent of the total value of the land, the state board of land commissioners may, in its discretion, reduce the amount which shall be paid in cash at the time of the sale to ten percent of the purchase price. The purchaser shall have the privilege, on any installment date, of paying on his original obligation, in addition to the installment then due, the sum necessary to reduce the original obligation by one hundred dollars or any multiple thereof, but in such event, except when any such additional payment is sufficient to discharge the purchaser's entire debt, the balance remaining due from the purchaser shall remain amortized for the remainder of said thirty-three-year period on the same interest basis, with adjusted semiannual installments. Any certificates of purchase outstanding on lands sold on or before May 2, 1929, may, when the state board of land commissioners deems it advisable, and upon application of the holder thereof, be converted to certificates of purchase on the amortization plan. The board shall have the right to charge such fees under this article as it may deem reasonable.

      <p>
       The general assembly declares that the state of Colorado recognizes that economic benefits can be derived for the people of the state from weather modification. Operations, research, experimentation, and development in the field of weather modification shall therefore be encouraged. In order to minimize possible adverse effects, weather modification activities shall be carried on with proper safeguards, and accurate information concerning such activities shall be made available for purposes of regulation. While recognizing the value of research and development of weather modification techniques by governmental agencies, the general assembly finds and declares that the actual practice of weather modification, whether at public or private expense, is properly a commercial activity which the law should encourage to be carried out, whenever practicable, by private enterprise.

      <p>
       The general assembly declares that the state of Colorado claims the right to all moisture suspended in the atmosphere which falls or is artificially induced to fall within its borders. Said moisture is declared to be the property of the people of this state, dedicated to their use pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of article XVI of the Colorado constitution and as otherwise provided by law. It is further declared that the state of Colorado also claims the prior right to increase or permit the increase of precipitation by artificial means for use in Colorado. The state of Colorado also claims the right to modify weather as it affects the people of the state of Colorado and to permit such modification by activity within Colorado.
