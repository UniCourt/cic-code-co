        The article was repealed and reenacted in 1973 with an effective date of July 1, 1974. (SeeL. 73, p. 819.) Section 3 of chapter 67, Session Laws of Colorado 1974, changed the effective date of the repeal and reenactment from July 1, 1974, to July 1, 1975. (SeeL. 74, p. 287.) In compiling C.R.S. 1973, which was not available until 1974, two versions were printed. Article 1 of chapter 71, C.R.S. 1963, was reorganized and renumbered as article 9 of title 27 in the compilation of C.R.S. 1973 and contained the original version of article 1 of chapter 71 found in C.R.S. 1963 in effect until July 1, 1975. The repealed and reenacted version of article 1 of chapter 71, C.R.S. 1963, effective July 1, 1975, was renumbered as article 10 in the compilation of C.R.S. 1973 and replaced article 9. (For the version of article 1 of chapter 71 in effect until July 1, 1975, see article 9 of title 27 in the original volume of C.R.S. 1973, pages 381 through 398.)

     <p>
      The general assembly finds that state and local agencies provide a variety of services and supports to persons with developmental disabilities including institutional care, residential, social, and income maintenance services, diagnostic and health-related services, and educational and other programs. Because these services and supports are supported by many diverse agencies and organizations and because congress, through the federal "Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Act", and amendments thereto, has called for the establishment of state councils to provide coordination and planning in the field of developmental disabilities, the general assembly declares that there is need to establish a state council on developmental disabilities to be responsible for the coordination of services and supports to the persons with developmental disabilities and to serve as an advocate for such persons. The general assembly further finds that there is need to carefully define the duties and responsibilities of a state council on developmental disabilities.

            There are people in Colorado communities who are experiencing behavioral health crises and need professional behavioral health crisis care or urgent psychiatric care from skilled mental health clinicians and medical professionals who excel at providing compassionate behavioral health crisis intervention and stabilization;

            Persons in a behavioral health crisis frequently come in contact with community first responders who are often unable to provide necessary behavioral health interventions or who must transport these persons in a behavioral health crisis to emergency rooms for services, or, in cases where a crime is alleged, to jail;

        The general assembly finds and declares that:
        <ol Class="alpha">
         <li id="t27-behavioralhealth-ar60-s27-60-105ol11a">
          Colorado's statutory scheme does not designate an entity responsible for competency restoration services, nor does it provide a sufficient framework for the provision of outpatient restoration services to adults or juveniles. As a result, there have been deficits and inconsistencies in the administration of the educational component of outpatient competency restoration services and the coordination and integration of that component with existing services and supports to address the underlying causes of incompetency.
         </li>
         <li id="t27-behavioralhealth-ar60-s27-60-105ol11b">
          The lack of a designated responsible entity for competency restoration services in Colorado has caused inconsistency in competency restoration services throughout the state and delays in proceedings that impact the due process rights of juveniles and adults involved in the juvenile and criminal justice systems, as well as the interests of victims;

         <li id="t27-behavioralhealth-ar60-s27-60-105ol11c">

          Many services essential to the restoration of competency can be provided through existing programs using existing funding. However, the current system lacks funding and responsibility for the educational component of competency restoration services and case management to access and leverage available services and supports which, combined, will help ensure an integrated approach to competency restoration for juveniles and adults.

        This section's grant of authority for a short-term involuntary hold in a private hospital does not pass the nexus/compulsion test for turning the private action of the hospital or the certifying doctor into state action. Wittner v. Banner Health, 720 F.3d 770 (10th Cir. 2013).

       <p>
        Involuntary commitment of the mentally ill is not a public function, that is, a traditional and exclusive function of the state, and thus state action. Wittner v. Banner Health, 720 F.3d 770 (10th Cir. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Private actor not transformed into a state actor under a joint action test. Allowing a hospital to hold a patient does not make the state responsible for a doctor's decision to medicate the patient, depriving the patient of constitutional rights. Wittner v.

       </p>
       <p>
        State's relationship with a private actor is no more than the mere private purchase of contract services. Public-private relationship did not transcend that of mere client and contractor because the private and public actors did not commingle their responsibilities. The state lacked the authority to unilaterally place patients at the hospital; it merely authorized the hospital to accept patients if it so chose. Wittner v.

        Any person alleged to have a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, to be a danger to others or to himself or herself or to be gravely disabled may be given an evaluation of his or her condition under a court order pursuant to this section.
       </li>
       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-106ol12">
        Any individual may petition the court in the county in which the respondent resides or is physically present alleging that there is a person who appears to have a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, appears to be a danger to others or to himself or herself or appears to be gravely disabled and requesting an evaluation of the person's condition.

       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-106ol13">
        The petition for a court-ordered evaluation must contain the following:

       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-106ol15">
        Following screening, the facility or professional person designated by the court shall file his or her report with the court. The report must include a recommendation as to whether there is probable cause to believe that the respondent has a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, is a danger to others or to himself or herself or is gravely disabled and whether the respondent will voluntarily receive evaluation or treatment. The screening report submitted to the court is confidential in accordance with section  27-65-121 and must be furnished to the respondent or his or her attorney or personal representative.

At the time of taking the respondent into custody, a copy of the petition and the order for evaluation must be given to the respondent, and promptly thereafter to any one person designated by the respondent and to the person in charge of the seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation facility named in the order or his or her designee.

        The respondent shall be evaluated as promptly as possible and shall in no event be detained longer than seventy-two hours under the court order, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays if treatment and evaluation services are not available on those days. Within that time, the respondent shall be released, referred for further care and treatment on a voluntary basis, or certified for short-term treatment.

        At the time the respondent is taken into custody for evaluation or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless a responsible relative is in possession of the respondent's personal property, the certified peace officer taking him or her into custody shall take reasonable precautions to preserve and safeguard the personal property in the possession of or on the premises occupied by the respondent.

       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol11">
        If a person detained for seventy-two hours pursuant to the provisions of section  27-65-105 or a respondent under court order for evaluation pursuant to section  27-65-106 has received an evaluation, he or she may be certified for not more than three months of short-term treatment under the following conditions:
        <ol Class="alpha">
         <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol11a">
          The professional staff of the agency or facility providing seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation has analyzed the person's condition and has found the person has a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, is a danger to others or to himself or herself or is gravely disabled.
         </li>
         <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol11b">
          The person has been advised of the availability of, but has not accepted, voluntary treatment; but, if reasonable grounds exist to believe that the person will not remain in a voluntary treatment program, his or her acceptance of voluntary treatment shall not preclude certification.
         </li>
         <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol11c">
          The facility which will provide short-term treatment has been designated or approved by the executive director to provide such treatment.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol12">
        The notice of certification must be signed by a professional person on the staff of the evaluation facility who participated in the evaluation and must state facts sufficient to establish reasonable grounds to believe that the person has a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, is a danger to others or to himself or herself or is gravely disabled. The certification must be filed with the court within forty-eight hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and court holidays, of the date of certification. The certification must be filed with the court in the county in which the respondent resided or was physically present immediately prior to being taken into custody.
       </li>
       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol13">
        Within twenty-four hours of certification, copies of the certification shall be personally delivered to the respondent, and a copy shall be kept by the evaluation facility as part of the person's record. The respondent shall also be asked to designate one other person whom he or she wishes informed regarding certification. If he or she is incapable of making such a designation at the time the certification is delivered, he or she shall be asked to designate such person as soon as he or she is capable. In addition to the copy of the certification, the respondent shall be given a written notice that a hearing upon his or her certification for short-term treatment may be had before the court or a jury upon written request directed to the court pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.
       </li>
       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol14">
        Upon certification of the respondent, the facility designated for short-term treatment shall have custody of the respondent.
       </li>
       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-107ol15">
        Whenever a certification is filed with the court, the court, if it has not already done so under section  27-65-106 (10), shall forthwith appoint an attorney to represent the respondent. The court shall determine whether the respondent is able to afford an attorney. If the respondent cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint either counsel from the legal services program operating in that jurisdiction or private counsel to represent the respondent. The attorney representing the respondent shall be provided with a copy of the certification immediately upon his or her appointment. Waiver of counsel must be knowingly and intelligently made in writing and filed with the court by the respondent. In the event that a respondent who is able to afford an attorney fails to pay the appointed counsel, such counsel, upon application to the court and after appropriate notice and hearing, may obtain a judgment for reasonable attorney fees against the respondent or person making request for such counsel or both the respondent and such person.
       </li>

          Constitutionality.

         <b>
          The term "danger" in subsection (1)(a) does not offend due process
         </b>
         as long as the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the individual's mental illness results in a present danger to herself or others or renders her gravely disabled. People v. Stevens, 761 P.2d 768 (Colo. 1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Less restrictive alternatives need not be considered as a condition precedent to certification.
         </b>
         Civil commitment constitutes a severe infringement of liberty requiring due process protection. However, the statutory scheme set forth in this article contains a number of procedural safeguards that greatly reduce the inherent risk of erroneous deprivation. Therefore, due process does not require a mandatory hearing at the time of certification since the statute provides for a hearing on request. People v. Stevens, 761 P.2d 768 (Colo. 1988).

          Standard for liability of medical professionals.
         </b>
         In determining whether to release an involuntarily committed mental patient, the psychiatrist has a legal duty to exercise due care, consistent with the knowledge and skill ordinarily possessed by psychiatric practitioners under similar circumstances, to determine whether the patient has a propensity for violence and would present an unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm to others. Perreira v. State, 768 P.2d 1198 (Colo. 1989).
        </p>
        <p>
         In discharging his duty, a psychiatrist may be required to take reasonable precautions to protect the public from the danger created by the release giving due consideration to extending the term of the patient's commitment or placing appropriate conditions and restrictions on such release. Perreira v. State, 768 P.2d 1198 (Colo. 1989).

          Standard for liability of medical professionals.

         No duty exists to prevent a third person from harming another unless a special relation exists between the actor and the wrongdoer or between the actor and the victim. Perreira v. State, 738 P.2d 4 (Colo. App. 1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Medical professionals involved in the care and treatment of a mentally ill patient have a legal duty under the "special relation" rule to prevent the patient from harming himself or others only if the patient in their care constitutes a danger to himself or to the safety of others. Perreira v. State, 738 P.2d 4 (Colo. App. 1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         This danger may be shown by evidence of injurious acts, attempts, or threats by the patient. Perreira v. State, 738 P.2d 4 (Colo. App. 1986).

        Whenever a respondent has received short-term treatment for five consecutive months pursuant to the provisions of sections  27-65-107 and  27-65-108, the professional person in charge of the evaluation and treatment may file a petition with the court for long-term care and treatment of the respondent under the following conditions:
        <ol Class="alpha">
         <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-109ol11a">
          The professional staff of the agency or facility providing short-term treatment has analyzed the respondent's condition and has found that the respondent has a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, is a danger to others or to himself or herself or is gravely disabled.
         </li>
         <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-109ol11b">
          The respondent has been advised of the availability of, but has not accepted, voluntary treatment; but, if reasonable grounds exist to believe that the respondent will not remain in a voluntary treatment program, his or her acceptance of voluntary treatment shall not preclude an order pursuant to this section.
         </li>
         <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-109ol11c">
          The facility that will provide long-term care and treatment has been designated or approved by the executive director to provide the care and treatment.

       </li>
       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-109ol12">
        Every petition for long-term care and treatment shall include a request for a hearing before the court prior to the expiration of six months from the date of original certification. A copy of the petition shall be delivered personally to the respondent for whom long-term care and treatment is sought and mailed to his or her attorney of record simultaneously with the filing thereof.
       </li>
       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-109ol13">
        Within ten days after receipt of the petition, the respondent or his or her attorney may request a jury trial by filing a written request therefor with the court.

       <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar65-s27-65-109ol14">
        The court or jury shall determine whether the conditions of subsection (1) of this section are met and whether the respondent has a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, is a danger to others or to himself or herself or is gravely disabled. The court shall thereupon issue an order of long-term care and treatment for a term not to exceed six months, or it shall discharge the respondent for whom long-term care and treatment was sought, or it shall enter any other appropriate order, subject to available appropriations. An order for long-term care and treatment must grant custody of the respondent to the department for placement with an agency or facility designated by the executive director to provide long-term care and treatment. When a petition contains a request that a specific legal disability be imposed or that a specific legal right be deprived, the court may order the disability imposed or the right deprived if the court or a jury has determined that the respondent has a mental health disorder or is gravely disabled and that, by reason thereof, the person is unable to competently exercise said right or perform the function as to which the disability is sought to be imposed. Any interested person may ask leave of the court to intervene as a copetitioner for the purpose of seeking the imposition of a legal disability or the deprivation of a legal right.

        An original order of long-term care and treatment or any extension of such order expires on the date specified, unless further extended as provided in this subsection (5). If an extension is being sought, the professional person in charge of the evaluation and treatment shall certify to the court at least thirty days prior to the expiration date of the order in force that an extension of the order is necessary for the care and treatment of the respondent subject to the order in force, and a copy of the certification must be delivered to the respondent and simultaneously mailed to his or her attorney of record. At least twenty days before the expiration of the order, the court shall give written notice to the respondent and his or her attorney of record that a hearing upon the extension may be had before the court or a jury upon written request to the court within ten days after receipt of the notice. If a hearing is not requested by the respondent within such time, the court may proceed ex parte. If a hearing is timely requested, it must be held before the expiration date of the order in force. If the court or jury finds that the conditions of subsection (1) of this section continue to be met and that the respondent has a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, is a danger to others or to himself or herself or is gravely disabled, the court shall issue an extension of the order. Any extension must not exceed six months, but there may be as many extensions as the court orders pursuant to this section.

        In determining whether to release an involuntarily committed mental patient, the psychiatrist has a legal duty to exercise due care, consistent with the knowledge and skill ordinarily possessed by psychiatric practitioners under similar circumstances to determine whether the patient has a propensity for violence and would present an unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm to others.

       No person who has received evaluation or treatment under any provisions of this article shall be discriminated against because of such status.

Any person who suffers injury by reason of a violation of this section shall have a civil cause of action.

       The general assembly finds that many parents in Colorado experience challenging circumstances because their children have significant mental health needs. Many times, the parents are loving, caring parents who have become increasingly frustrated in their attempts to navigate the various governmental systems, including child welfare, mental health, law enforcement, juvenile justice, education, and youth services, in an attempt to find help for their children. Frequently in these situations, an action in dependency or neglect under article 3 of title 19 is neither appropriate nor warranted.
      </li>
      <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar67-s27-67-102ol12">
       The general assembly finds that it is desirable to assist children and youth with mental health needs and their families. The general assembly further finds that it is desirable to make mental health services more available to families who want treatment for their children. The general assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide a full range of mental health treatment services, including residential care, to children and youth who are not eligible for medicaid. The general assembly further finds that, although the mental health agencies are responsible for providing or coordinating the full range of mental health treatment services, including residential care, for those children and youth who have been found to be categorically eligible for medicaid, there remains a population of children and youth in need of mental health services who are not categorically eligible for medicaid. Accordingly, the general assembly determines that it is appropriate to adopt a program pursuant to which a continuum of services would be provided to these children and youth.
      </li>
      <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar67-s27-67-102ol13">
       The general assembly therefore finds that children and youth who are categorically eligible for medicaid and who may be eligible for mental health treatment services, including residential care, may need support in identifying clear appeals processes.

         A parent or guardian may apply to a mental health agency on behalf of a child or youth for mental health treatment services for the child or youth pursuant to this section, if the parent or guardian believes the child or youth is at risk of out-of-home placement. The parent's or guardian's request for services described in this section may be done with assistance from a family advocate, family systems navigator, nonprofit advocacy organization, or county department; however, the state department is not obligated to pay for any services provided by entities with which they do not contract. In such circumstances, the mental health agency is responsible for evaluating the child or youth and clinically assessing the child's or youth's need for mental health services and, when warranted, to provide treatment services as necessary and in the best interests of the child or youth and the child's or youth's family. When evaluating a child or youth for eligibility, the mental health agency shall use a standardized risk stratification tool, in a manner determined by rule of the state department. Following the evaluation of the child or youth, the mental health agency shall provide a written notification to the child's or youth's parent or guardian that includes a comprehensive list of potential treatment providers, with a disclosure that the child's or youth's family may choose to seek services from the provider of their choice, including but not limited to the mental health agency. The written notification must also inform the child's or youth's family that they may request assistance from a family advocate, family systems navigator, nonprofit advocacy organization, or county department; however, the state department is not obligated to pay for any services provided by entities with which they do not contract. The state department shall maintain a list of available providers on a public website and shall update the website quarterly. The mental health agency is responsible for the provision of the treatment services and care management, including any residential treatment, community-based care, or any post-residential follow-up services that may be appropriate for the child's or youth's needs or his or her family's needs. A dependency or neglect action pursuant to article 3 of title 19 is not required in order to allow a family access to residential mental health treatment services for a child or youth.

         At the time of the assessment by the mental health agency, if requested services are denied, or at the time when the mental health agency has recommended that the child or youth be discharged from services, the mental health agency shall advise the family, both orally and in writing, of the appeal process available to them. The mental health agency shall have two working days within which to complete any internal appeal process. Within five working days after the mental health agency's final denial or recommendation for discharge, a parent or guardian may request an objective third party at the state department who is a professional person to review the action of the mental health agency. A family advocate, family systems navigator, nonprofit advocacy organization, or county department may assist a family in filing an appeal; however, the state department is not obligated to pay for any services provided by entities with which they do not contract. The review must occur within three working days of the parent's or guardian's request. The professional person shall determine if the requested services are appropriate.

Within ten working days after the referral, if assigned for an assessment by the county department, a representative of the mental health agency shall meet with the county department and the family. Upon referral to the county department, if assigned for an assessment, the county department shall proceed with the assessment to determine whether there is a sufficient basis to believe that physical or sexual abuse or neglect or some other form of abuse or neglect of a child's or youth's physical well-being has occurred.

       The general assembly finds and declares that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar69-s27-69-101ol11a">
         Colorado families and youth have difficulties navigating the mental and behavioral health, physical health, substance abuse, intellectual and developmental disabilities, education, juvenile justice, child welfare, and other state and local systems that are compounded when the youth has a behavioral, mental health, or co-occurring disorder;
        </li>
        <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar69-s27-69-101ol11b">
         Preliminary research demonstrates that family advocates and family systems navigators increase family and youth satisfaction, improve family participation, and improve services to help youth and families succeed and achieve positive outcomes. One preliminary study in Colorado found that the wide array of useful characteristics and valued roles performed by family advocates and family systems navigators, regardless of where they are located institutionally, provided evidence for continuing and expanding the use of family advocates and family systems navigators in systems of care.
        </li>
        <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar69-s27-69-101ol11c">
         Input from families, youth, and state and local community agency representatives in Colorado demonstrates that family advocates and family systems navigators help families get the services and support they need and want, help families to better navigate complex state and local systems, improve family and youth outcomes, and help disengaged families and youth to become engaged families and youth;
        </li>
        <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar69-s27-69-101ol11d">
         State and local agencies and systems need to develop more strengths-based, family-centered, individualized, culturally competent, and collaborative approaches that better meet the needs of families and youth;
        </li>
        <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar69-s27-69-101ol11e">
         A family advocate or a family systems navigator helps state and local agencies and systems adopt more strengths-based-targeted programs, policies, and services to better meet the needs of families and their youth with behavioral, mental health, or co-occurring disorders and improve outcomes for all, including families, youth, and the agencies they utilize;
        </li>
        <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar69-s27-69-101ol11f">
         The use of family advocates or family systems navigators as full partners in systems of care is a relatively new approach to helping meet the needs of families and youth in the state. It is essential that communities have the support to implement and sustain programs in a manner that best meets the needs of youth, families, and communities.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t27-mentalhealthandmentalhealthdisorders-ar69-s27-69-101ol12">
       It is therefore in the state's best interest to develop rules and standards and provide technical assistance and coordination for the family advocacy mental health juvenile justice programs for system-of-care family advocates and family systems navigators for behavioral or mental health juvenile justice populations who navigate across behavioral or mental health, physical health, substance abuse, intellectual and developmental disabilities, juvenile justice, education, child welfare, and other state and local systems to ensure sustained and thoughtful family participation in the planning processes of the care for their children and youth.

         The lack of medication consistency for individuals with behavioral or mental health disorders who are involved in the criminal and juvenile justice systems creates additional, often serious, problems for these individuals;

         By working cooperatively with the criminal and juvenile justice systems and mental health service providers, the state can help ensure medication consistency and also decrease overall state costs through the use of a common and agreed upon medication formulary and cooperative purchasing;

         Prior to its repeal in 2018, the medication consistency work group of the behavioral health transformation council identified mental health medications that are essential and preferred for a basic medication formulary that could be used across all public systems to increase medication continuity for individuals with behavioral or mental health disorders in the criminal and juvenile justice systems; and

         Increasing information sharing across systems and service providers about the importance of medication consistency and the use of a common and agreed upon medication formulary and cooperative purchasing will result in long-term benefits for the state and for individuals with behavioral or mental health disorders who are involved in the criminal and juvenile justice systems.

       The general assembly recognizes the character and pervasiveness of substance use disorders and that substance use disorders are serious problems. The general assembly further finds and declares that these problems have been very seriously neglected and that the social and economic costs and the waste of human resources caused by substance use disorders are massive, tragic, and no longer acceptable. The general assembly believes that the best interests of this state demand an across-the-board, locally oriented attack on the massive problems of drug abuse and substance use disorders. The attack includes prevention, education, and treatment, and this article 81 provides a base from which to launch the attack and reduce the tragic human loss.

       It is the policy of this state that persons with substance use disorders, persons intoxicated by alcohol, and persons under the influence of drugs should be afforded treatment so they may lead normal lives as productive members of society. The general assembly finds and declares that substance use disorders are matters of statewide concern.

        Due process considerations.
       </b>
       A judicial hearing as a prerequisite to commitment of a clearly dangerous intoxicated person would hinder the government's efforts in controlling alcohol abuse without providing additional procedural safeguards. Due process demands only that a neutral fact finder independently determine that the statutory requirements for commitment and release are satisfied. Due process does not dictate that the neutral and detached fact finder be law-trained or a judicial or administrative officer. Carberry v. Adams County Task Force on Alcoholism, 672 P.2d 206 (Colo. 1983).

       <b>
        Intent of subsection (1).
       </b>
       In enacting subsection (1), the general assembly did not intend the police to take into protective custody every intoxicated person they meet. Rather, the general assembly designated a specific class of intoxicated persons who are subject to emergency commitment and left the determination of whether a particular individual is clearly dangerous to the police. Therefore, the decision to take a person into protective custody is discretionary and protected by official immunity. Leake v. Cain, 720 P.2d 152 (Colo. 1986).

      <p>
       <b>
        Class of persons section was designated to protect.
       </b>
       Respondents-decedents are not included within the class of persons that subsection (1) was designated to protect, since the statutory intent was not to protect members of the public against intoxicated persons. Therefore, police officers had no duty to take defendant into "protective custody" or to escort him to his home. Leake v. Cain, 720 P.2d 152 (Colo. 1986).
      </p>

       The court may commit a person to the custody of the office of behavioral health upon the petition of the person's spouse or guardian, a relative, a physician, an advanced practice nurse, the administrator in charge of an approved treatment facility, or any other responsible person. The petition must allege that the person has a substance use disorder and that the person has threatened or attempted to inflict or inflicted physical harm on himself or herself or on another and that unless committed the person is likely to inflict physical harm on himself or herself or on another or that the person is incapacitated by substances. A refusal to undergo treatment does not constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment. The petition must be accompanied by a certificate of a licensed physician who has examined the person within ten days before submission of the petition, unless the person whose commitment is sought has refused to submit to a medical examination, in which case the fact of refusal must be alleged in the petition, or an examination cannot be made of the person due to the person's condition. The certificate must set forth the physician's findings in support of the petition's allegations.

       A court shall not accept a petition submitted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section unless there is documentation of the refusal by the person to be committed to accessible and affordable voluntary treatment. The documentation may include, but is not limited to, notations in the person's medical or law enforcement records or statements by a physician, advanced practice nurse, or witness.

A copy of the petition and the notice of the hearing, including the date fixed by the court, must be personally served on the petitioner, the person whose commitment is sought, and one of the person's parents or the person's legal guardian if the person is a minor. A copy of the petition and notice of hearing must be provided to the office of behavioral health, to counsel for the person whose commitment is sought, to the administrator in charge of the approved treatment facility to which the person may have been committed for emergency treatment, and to any other person the court believes advisable.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that facilities that provide treatment to individuals with a substance use disorder, including medication-assisted treatment, and clinics that provide obstetric and gynecological health care services would better serve pregnant and postpartum women if the services could be coordinated and provided to women at the same location. It is the intent of the general assembly to fund a pilot program to integrate these health care services at specified facilities and clinics and require the office of behavioral health to evaluate the pilot program and report the results of the pilot program to the general assembly.

          The general assembly hereby finds and declares that currently there are no juvenile detention facilities with commitment beds or locked detention beds in the southwest portion of Colorado and that the nearest such facility in the Grand Junction or Glenwood Springs area is as much as four hours away from some southwestern communities.

In addition, the general assembly finds and declares that the juvenile commitment population is expected to increase by forty-nine and nine-tenths percent by the year 2002. The general assembly finds and declares that the growth patterns on the western slope of the state have led to a growth in population of at-risk youth and increased crime and that the office of youth services accordingly has experienced a shortfall of both detention and commitment beds in the western part of the state.

        The general assembly recognizes that many of the individuals receiving services from department employees pursuant to title 26 or this title 27 are unable to defend themselves and are therefore vulnerable to abuse or assault. It is the intent of the general assembly to minimize the potential for hiring and employing persons with a propensity toward abuse, assault, or similar offenses against others for positions that would provide them with unsupervised access to vulnerable persons. The general assembly declares that, in accordance with section 13 of article XII of the state constitution, for purposes of terminating employees in the state personnel system who are finally convicted of criminal conduct, offenses involving moral turpitude include, but are not limited to, the disqualifying offenses specified in subsection (9) of this section.

The person's employment is conditional upon a satisfactory state and national fingerprint-based criminal history record check. A criminal history record check conducted pursuant to this subsection (4) must include but need not be limited to arrests, conviction records, and the disposition of any criminal charges. The department shall require the person to have his or her fingerprints taken by a local law enforcement agency or any third party approved by the Colorado bureau of investigation.
