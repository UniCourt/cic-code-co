       The general assembly declares that state and local policymakers and health and human services administrators recognize that the management of and the delivery system for health and human services have become complex, fragmented, and costly and that the health and human services delivery system in this state should be restructured to adequately address the needs of Colorado citizens.

      <li id="t25-administration-ar01-p01-s25.5-1-102ol12">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that a continuing budget crisis makes it unlikely that funding sources will keep pace with the increasing demands of health and human services.
      </li>
      <li id="t25-administration-ar01-p01-s25.5-1-102ol13">
       Therefore, the general assembly finds that it is appropriate to restructure principal departments responsible for overseeing the delivery of health and human services and to reform the state's health and human services administration and delivery system, using guiding principles and within the time frames set forth in article 1.7 of title 24, C.R.S., as said article existed prior to July 1, 1997. It is the general assembly's intent that the departments of public health and environment, health care policy and financing, and human services be operational, effective July 1, 1994.

         Uninsured, underinsured, and older Coloradans pay a disproportionately greater share of their income for prescription drugs. In many cases, current drug prices have the effect of denying residents access to necessary medical care, thereby threatening their health and safety.

        <li id="t25-prescriptiondrugs-ar2.5-p01-s25.5-2.5-102ol11b">

         Additionally, the new medicare prescription drug benefit restricts persons from purchasing insurance in order to fully cover their prescription drug needs. This restriction on a person's ability to purchase adequate coverage may threaten the person's health and safety.

      <li id="t25-prescriptiondrugs-ar2.5-p01-s25.5-2.5-102ol12">
       The general assembly, therefore, declares that it is important to make information available to the public concerning ways to purchase lower-cost generic and nonpatented prescription drugs through the "Colorado Cares Rx Act" in order to protect the health of uninsured, underinsured, and older Coloradans. The general assembly further declares that the state should continue to actively research cost-effective mechanisms or programs that may provide additional options to address this need in Colorado.

      . As a condition of eligibility for services under this part 1, a legal immigrant shall agree to refrain from executing an affidavit of support for the purpose of sponsoring an alien on or after July 1, 1997, under rules promulgated by the immigration and naturalization service, or any successor agency, during the pendency of such legal immigrant's receipt of services under this part 1. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect a legal immigrant's eligibility for services under this part 1 based upon such legal immigrant's responsibilities under an affidavit of support entered into before July 1, 1997.

       Under this statutory section, reimbursement may not be provided for an abortion that is not necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman. Therefore this section is consistent with section 50 of article V which expresses the intention of the people that no induced abortion shall be paid for by public funds unless necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman and unless every reasonable effort also has been made to preserve the life of the unborn child.

Urbish v. Lamm, 761 P.2d 756 (Colo. 1988).

       Rule promulgated by department of social services which provided that when a pregnant woman's life is endangered, public funds may be used for an abortion of a viable unborn child before term only in circumstances where every reasonable effort has been made to preserve the lives of both the mother and the unborn child is within the scope of the exception to the prohibition on the use of public funds to pay for abortions. In contrast, a rule which allowed the public funding of abortions of unborn children who would die of natural causes at or before birth even if the mother's life was not threatened by carrying the unborn child for a longer period was beyond the scope of the exception.

       "Comprehensive primary care" means the basic, entry-level health care provided by health care practitioners or non-physician health care practitioners that is generally provided in an outpatient setting. "Comprehensive primary care", at a minimum, includes providing or arranging for the provision of the following services on a year-round basis: Primary health care; maternity care, including prenatal care; preventive, developmental, and diagnostic services for infants and children; adult preventive services; diagnostic laboratory and radiology services; emergency care for minor trauma; pharmaceutical services; and coordination and follow-up for hospital care. "Comprehensive primary care" may also include optional services based on a patient's needs. For the purposes of this subsection (1) and subsection (2) of this section, "arranging for the provision" means demonstrating established referral relationships with health care providers for any of the comprehensive primary care services not directly provided by an entity. An entity in a rural area may be exempt from this requirement if it can demonstrate that there are no providers in the community to provide one or more of the comprehensive primary care services.

      It is the purpose of the "Colorado Medical Assistance Act" to promote the public health and welfare of the people of Colorado by providing, in cooperation with the federal government, medical and remedial care and services for individuals and families whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of such necessary services and to assist such individuals and families to attain or retain their capabilities for independence and self-care, as contemplated by the provisions of Title XIX of the social security act. The state of Colorado and its various departments, agencies, and political subdivisions are authorized to promote and achieve these ends by any appropriate lawful means, through cooperation with and the utilization of available resources of the federal government and private individuals and organizations.

The state department shall promulgate rules consistent with federal law that prescribe the circumstances under which the county or designated service agency may continue benefits if an appeal is filed after the effective date of the intended action. At a minimum, the rules must allow for continuing benefits when the recipient's health or safety is impacted, the recipient was not able to timely respond due to the recipient's disability or employment, the recipient's caregiver was unavailable due to the caregiver's health or employment, or the recipient did not receive the county's or designated service agency's notice prior to the effective date of the intended action.

The dispute resolution process must be consistent with rules promulgated by the state board pursuant to article 4 of title 24, C.R.S. The dispute resolution process shall include an opportunity for all clients to have a county conference, upon the client's request, and such requirement may be met through a telephonic conference upon the agreement of the client and the county department. The dispute resolution process need not conform to the requirements of section  24-4-105, C.R.S., as long as the rules adopted by the state board include provisions specifically setting forth expeditious time frames, notice, and an opportunity to be heard and to present information.

        Colorado's medicaid lien statute is not inconsistent with the anti-lien provisions of the federal Medicaid Act.

       It is consistent with the federal medicaid statute's anti-lien provisions as interpreted by the U.S. supreme court in Arkansas Dept. of Health & Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U.S. 268, 126 S. Ct. 1752, 164 L. Ed. 2d 459 (2006). I.P. ex rel. Cardenas v. Henneberry, 795 F. Supp. 2d 1189 (D.

       Department of health care policy and financing's lien on settlement proceeds from medicaid recipient's malpractice suit is tantamount to a forced assignment of the right to recover that portion of the settlement that represents payments for medical care, which, under Ahlborn, is consistent with both the third-party liability provisions and the anti-lien provisions in the federal medicaid statute. I.P. ex rel. Cardenas v. Henneberry, 795 F. Supp. 2d 1189 (D.

        Where section requires the department to establish an estate recovery program consistent with federal law
       </b>
       and federal standards require the state to adopt procedures under which individuals who will be affected by recovery will have the right to apply for an undue hardship waiver, the department's rule allowing for service of notice on the personal representative of the decedent's estate is reasonably calculated to give notice to the affected individuals. However, department's notice was fatally defective since it did not instruct the personal representative to forward the notice to affected individuals nor did it identify who should receive the notice.

       Under this statutory section, reimbursement may not be provided for an abortion that is not necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman. Therefore this section is consistent with section 50 of article V which expresses the intention of the people that no induced abortion shall be paid for by public funds unless necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman and unless every reasonable effort also has been made to preserve the life of the unborn child.

       Rule promulgated by department of social services which provided that when a pregnant woman's life is endangered, public funds may be used for an abortion of a viable unborn child before term only in circumstances where every reasonable effort has been made to preserve the lives of both the mother and the unborn child is within the scope of the exception to the prohibition on the use of public funds to pay for abortions. In contrast, a rule which allowed the public funding of abortions of unborn children who would die of natural causes at or before birth even if the mother's life was not threatened by carrying the unborn child for a longer period was beyond the scope of the exception.

        Colorado's abortion funding restriction violates Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17), because it is inconsistent with the basic objective of Title XIX, that is, to provide qualified individuals with medically necessary care.

       A state law that categorically denies coverage for a specific, medically necessary procedure except in those rare instances when the patient's life is at stake is not a "reasonable standard[] . . . consistent with the objectives of [the Act]", 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17), but instead contravenes the purposes of Title XIX.

           As of 2011, Colorado was one of only ten states that did not offer basic oral health services to adults under medicaid;

          <li id="t25-coloradomedicalassistanceact-ar05-p02-s25.5-5-207ol11aII">
           Research has shown that untreated oral health conditions negatively affect a person's overall health and that gum disease has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, strokes, kidney disease, dementia diseases and related disabilities, and even behavioral or mental health disorders;
          </li>
          <li id="t25-coloradomedicalassistanceact-ar05-p02-s25.5-5-207ol11aIII">
           Regular dental care and prevention are the most cost-effective methods available to prevent minor oral conditions from developing into more complex oral and physical health conditions that would eventually require emergency and palliative care;
          </li>
          <li id="t25-coloradomedicalassistanceact-ar05-p02-s25.5-5-207ol11aIV">
           Further, one in four adults has untreated tooth decay. Early detection and access to preventive and restorative treatments for oral health conditions can be up to ten times less expensive than treating those same conditions in an emergency setting.
          </li>
          <li id="t25-coloradomedicalassistanceact-ar05-p02-s25.5-5-207ol11aV">
           Research has also shown that good oral health improves medicaid beneficiaries' ability to obtain and keep employment. Employed adults lose more than one hundred and sixty-four million hours of work each year due to dental problems.

          <li id="t25-coloradomedicalassistanceact-ar05-p02-s25.5-5-207ol11aVII">
           Pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable adult populations that are without oral health benefits under medicaid. During pregnancy, the physical changes a woman's body undergoes can negatively affect oral health. Untreated decay and periodontal disease are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as increased risk for preeclampsia, pre-term labor, and low birth weight babies.

       The general assembly finds that many parents in Colorado who have experienced challenging circumstances because their children have significant mental health needs and who have attempted to care for their children or seek services on their behalf often are burdened with the excessive financial and personal costs of providing such care. Private insurance companies may not cover mental health services and rarely cover residential mental health treatment services; those that do seldom cover a sufficient percentage of the expense to make such mental health treatment a viable option for many families in need. The result is that many families do not have the ability to obtain the mental health services that they feel their children desperately need. The general assembly finds that it is in the best interests of these families and the citizens of the state to encourage the preservation of family units by making mental health treatment available to these children pursuant to article 67 of title 27, C.R.S.

       The general assembly finds that, because Colorado is faced with rising health care costs and limited resources, it is necessary to seek new ways to ensure the availability of high-quality, cost-efficient care for medicaid recipients. The general assembly further finds that disease management is a patient-focused, integrated approach to providing all components of care with attention to both quality of care and total cost. In addition, the general assembly finds that this approach may include coordination of physician care with pharmaceutical and institutional care. The general assembly further finds that disease management also addresses the various aspects of a disease state, including meeting the needs of persons who have multiple chronic illnesses. The general assembly declares that the improved coordination in disease management helps to provide chronically ill patients with access to the latest advances in treatment and teaches them how to be active participants in their health care through health education, thus reducing total health care costs.

The disease management programs shall target medicaid recipients who are receiving prescription drugs or services in an amount that exceeds guidelines outlined by the state department. The state department shall not restrict a medicaid recipient's access to the most cost-effective and medically appropriate prescription drugs or services. The state department may contract on a contingency basis for the development or implementation of the disease management programs authorized in this subsection (2).

Such report shall be made on or before February 1 of the year following the implementation of a disease management program and on or before each February 1 thereafter in which such program is in place.

       On or after January 1, 2002, face-to-face contact between a health care provider and a patient is not required under the statewide managed care system created in this part 4 for services appropriately provided through telemedicine, subject to reimbursement policies developed by the state department to compensate providers who provide health care services covered by the program created in section  25.5-4-104. Telemedicine services may only be used in areas of the state where the technology necessary for the provision of telemedicine exists. The audio and visual telemedicine system used must, at a minimum, have the capability to meet the procedural definition of the most recent edition of the current procedural terminology that represents the service provided through telemedicine. The telecommunications equipment must be of a level of quality to adequately complete all necessary components to document the level of service for the current procedural terminology fourth edition codes that are billed. If a peripheral diagnostic scope is required to assess the patient, it must provide adequate resolution or audio quality for decision-making.

        Once person was initially determined to be eligible for HCBS benefits, his right to continued receipt of the same was similar to "property" right for purposes of the application of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
       </b>
       Thus, he could be deprived of those continued benefits only by means of a procedure that complied with the tenets of due process of law. Weaver v. Dept. of Soc. Servs., 791 P.2d 1230 (Colo. App. 1990).

       and that, if the termination of benefits is not to be deemed arbitrary, a showing of some change in circumstances is required applies to the benefits under this section. Weaver v. Dept. of Soc. Servs., 791 P.2d 1230 (Colo. App. 1990).

        In the absence of a waiver of any defect in the form of the notice, a notice of adverse action that does not substantially comply with the federal and state requirements cannot provide the basis for a deprivation of benefits.

       The general assembly finds that many families who attempt to care for severely disabled or terminally ill children at home often are burdened with the excessive financial and personal costs of providing continuous care. Private insurance companies rarely support essential, long-term custodial services and often establish monetary limits that are well below the levels required by these disabled children. When coverage is available, care is frequently provided in a medical model that is marginally appropriate to the needs of the children and the family and usually more expensive to the payor. The resulting pressures often contribute to family disintegration and increased dependency on public programs. The general assembly finds that it is in the best interests of the citizens of the state to encourage the preservation of families with children with disabilities.

       The general assembly finds that there may be a more effective way to deliver home- and community-based services to the elderly, blind, and disabled; to disabled children; and to persons with spinal cord injuries, that allows for more self-direction in their care and a cost savings to the state. The general assembly also finds that every person that is currently receiving home- and community-based services does not need the same level of supervision and care from a licensed health care professional in order to meet his or her care needs and remain living in the community. The general assembly, therefore, declares that it is beneficial to the elderly, blind, and disabled clients of home- and community-based services, to clients of the disabled children care program, and to clients enrolled in the spinal cord injury waiver pilot program, for the state department to develop a service that would allow these people to receive in-home support.

Therefore, the general assembly declares that it is appropriate for the state department to develop a plan for expanding the availability of in-home support services to include these clients.

        The general assembly hereby finds and declares that a significant percentage of children are uninsured. This lack of health insurance coverage decreases children's access to preventive health care services, compromises the productivity of the state's future workforce, and results in avoidable expenditures for emergency and remedial health care. Health care providers, health care facilities, and all purchasers of health care, including the state, bear the costs of this uncompensated care.

        Court's power to act in absence of statutory authorization.
       </b>
       A district court acting in its probate capacity has the power in the absence of statutory authorization to act on a petition for sterilization of a mentally retarded minor. In re A.W., 637 P.2d 366 (Colo. 1981).

      <p>
       A court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction over incompetents may extend to decisions involving irrevocable consequences for the incompetent individual. In re A.W., 637 P.2d 366 (Colo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since statutory provisions concerning sterilization of mentally retarded persons do not address the issue of sterilization of a minor, it is within the district court's inherent authority to consider a petition for sterilization of a minor, and, in the absence of legislative pronouncement, it is proper and necessary for the supreme court to promulgate standards for determining the circumstances under which such a procedure may be performed. In re A.W., 637 P.2d 366 (Colo. 1981).

       <b>
        Preliminary determinations court must make.
       </b>
       In considering a petition to sterilize a mentally retarded minor, the district court must make the following preliminary determinations. First, while the mentally retarded person need not testify or be present at the proceedings if the person's presence would serve no useful purpose, the trial judge should talk with the person and observe the person's physical and mental condition. The wishes of the person, although not conclusive, are relevant, and a strong indication that the person does not wish to be sterilized must weigh heavily against authorizing the procedure. Second, the district court must determine that the person's capacity to make a decision about sterilization is unlikely to improve in the future. Third, the person for whom sterilization is requested must be proven capable of reproduction. In re A.W., 637 P.2d 366 (Colo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sterilization of mentally retarded minor must be medically necessary.
       </b>
       Once a district court determines preliminary matters relating to a petition to sterilize a mentally retarded minor, it must find by clear and convincing evidence that the sterilization is medically essential. A sterilization is medically essential if clearly necessary, in the opinion of experts, to preserve the life or physical or mental health of the mentally retarded person. In re A.W., 637 P.2d 366 (Colo. 1981).

       It is the intent of the general assembly that the service delivery system for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities emphasize community living for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities and provide supports to persons that enable them to enjoy typical lifestyles. One way to accomplish this is to recognize that families are the greatest resource available to persons who have an intellectual and developmental disability and that families must be supported in their role as primary care givers. The general assembly finds that supporting families in their effort to provide supports for their family members at home is more efficient, cost-effective, and humane than maintaining persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities in out-of-home residential settings. In recognition of the importance of families, the general assembly states that the following principles should be used as guidelines in developing programs to support a family that has a child with disabilities:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t25-children'sbasichealthplan-ar10-p03-s25.5-10-301ol11a">

        <li id="t25-children'sbasichealthplan-ar10-p03-s25.5-10-301ol11d">

       In addition, the general assembly recognizes that the state department has for several years developed and maintained a family resource service program that provides support services to families of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are at risk of out-of-home placement. Because of the success of this program the general assembly recommends that this valuable program be continued and expanded so that more families in this state are able to receive appropriate services, supports, and assistance needed to stabilize the family unit. In recognition of the basic goal to support families, on an individual family basis, in maintaining a person with an intellectual and developmental disability at home and in recognition of the principles stated in subsection (1) of this section, the general assembly declares that its purpose in enacting this part 3 is to create, subject to annual appropriation, a comprehensive statewide family support service program.
