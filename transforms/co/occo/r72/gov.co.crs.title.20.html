        Failure to file paperwork for oath with secretary of state in a timely fashion does not create a permanent vacancy.
       </b>
       No permanent vacancy is created if an elected district attorney misses the deadline to timely file the necessary paperwork for his or her oath and bond requirements with the secretary of state. Therefore, the elected district attorney is authorized to prosecute defendants during a period of a temporary defect. The district attorney acts as a de facto officer whose acts performed in the discharge of his or her official duties were valid and binding. People v. Scott, 116 P.3d 1227 (Colo. App. 2004).

    The district attorney, and not the attorney general, is the proper officer to institute proceedings in quo warranto in the inferior courts and he may also under this section follow the case into the supreme court, from which time the attorney general would at once be entitled to control its further progress.

    Proper procedure to be followed by one claiming to be imprisoned without legal authority is to file a civil action seeking a writ of habeas corpus, naming as respondent the person or persons in whose custody he is detained; the people of the state of Colorado is not a proper party to such proceedings since an application for a writ of habeas corpus is a civil action, independent of the criminal charge, and is not part of the inquiry based on the information.

     Duty to appear at grand juries.
    </b>
    This section not only gives the district attorney the right to appear at all sessions of grand juries, but makes it his duty to do so. People ex rel. District Att'y v. District Court, 75<cite class="co_code">Colo. 412</cite>, 225 P. 829 (1924).

     Purpose of section.
    </b>
    This right and duty of the district attorney to appear before grand juries is but a recognition and indorsement of a practice which has long prevailed, not only in many of the states, and in the federal courts, but in England. The presence of the prosecuting officer tends to expedite the work of the grand jury, and the knowledge of the facts there obtained is of advantage to him in the preparation and trial of the indictments returned. People ex rel. District Att'y v. District Court, 75<cite class="co_code">Colo. 412</cite>, 225 P. 829 (1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Mere presence of investigators from the district attorney's staff at grand jury sessions
    </b>
    may not in and of itself be sufficient to invalidate an indictment in a given case unless prejudice is shown. People v. Lewis, 183<cite class="co_code">Colo. 236</cite>, 516 P.2d 416 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Grand jurors must remain free to reach their own conclusions
    </b>
    based on the facts presented to them. People v. Meyers, 617 P.2d 808 (Colo. 1980).

      <p>
       <b>
     Prosecutor must exercise due care
    </b>
    to assure that he does not unduly influence the grand jury. People v. Meyers, 617 P.2d 808 (Colo. 1980).

       <b>
     And transcript released to defense where misconduct affects indictment or probable cause determination.
    </b>
    Only in cases where clear examples of inappropriate conduct by the district attorney may affect the validity of the defendant's indictment or the determination of probable cause should the trial court sacrifice the confidentiality of the grand jury proceedings and release a transcript of the grand jury colloquy between the district attorney and the grand jury to the defense counsel.

       A district attorney may only be disqualified in a particular case at the request of the district attorney or upon a showing that the district attorney has a personal or financial interest or finds special circumstances that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial. A motion to disqualify a district attorney shall be served upon the district attorney at least two weeks before the motion is heard. Such motion shall contain at least a statement of the facts setting forth the grounds for the claimed disqualification and the legal authorities relied upon by the movant and shall be supported by affidavits of witnesses who are competent to testify to the facts set forth in the affidavit. The district attorney may file a response in opposition to the motion and may appear at any hearing held on the motion. The judge shall review the pleadings and determine whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary. The motion shall not be granted unless requested by the district attorney or unless the court finds that the district attorney has a personal or financial interest or special circumstances exist that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial. The order disqualifying the district attorney shall be stayed pending any appeal authorized by this section.

        Disqualification for appearance of impropriety does not violate separation of powers.
       </b>
       Although appearance of impropriety is not specifically codified, it is an acceptable basis for disqualification. Once the decision to prosecute is made, it becomes a matter of judicial responsibility, not a matter of legislative declaration. Thus, there is no separation of powers problem. People v. Witty, 35 P.3d 69 (Colo. App. 2000).

     Purpose.
    </b>
    This section is designed to authorize the disqualification of a district attorney and to allow for the appointment of a special prosecutor only when the district attorney has an interest in the litigation apart from his professional responsibility of upholding the law. People v. District Court, 189<cite class="co_code">Colo. 159</cite>, 538 P.2d 887 (1975); People ex rel. N.R., 139 P.3d 671 (Colo. 2006).

       <b>
     The 2002 amendment to subsection (2) eliminates "the appearance of impropriety" as a basis for disqualification.
    </b>
    Under the current version of the statute, disqualification is proper only when (1) the district attorney requests his or her own disqualification, (2) the district attorney has either a personal or a financial interest in the prosecution, or (3) special circumstances exist that would make it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial. People v. Lincoln, 161 P.3d 1274 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     The fundamental inquiry is whether disqualification of a district attorney appears reasonably necessary to ensure
    </b>
    the integrity of the fact finding process, the fairness or appearance of fairness of trial, the orderly or efficient administration of justice, or public trust or confidence in the criminal justice system. People v. Palomo, 31 P.3d 879 (Colo. 2003); People v. Lee, 93 P.3d 544 (Colo. App. 2003) (decided under law in effect prior to the 2002 amendment).

       <b>
        Appointment is to avoid appearance of impropriety.
       </b>
       The most compelling rationale for requiring appointment of a special prosecutor is avoidance of the appearance of impropriety. People v. Stevens, 642 P.2d 39 (Colo. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any inconvenience to the prosecution resulting from appointment of a special prosecutor is but a small price to pay to avoid the appearance of impropriety. People v. Stevens, 642 P.2d 39 (Colo. App. 1981).

    The district court has authority, in certain cases specified in this and the following section, to appoint someone to discharge the duties of the office of district attorney.

     Interest requiring removal defined.

      <p>
       It is the district attorney's duty to hold himself under proper restraint and avoid violent partisanship, partiality, and misconduct in the performance of his duties which may result in false accusations, and it is equally his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to bring about a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to obtain a just conviction.

     Trial court erred in disqualifying district attorney
    </b>
    because none of the four grounds cited by the trial court constituted "special circumstances . . . that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial". The inquiry into whether an entire district attorney's office should be disqualified because of a prior representation by an individual prosecutor depends on whether confidential information gained from that prior representation has been or could be passed from the individual prosecutor to other members of the office who continue to prosecute the case. People v. Perez, 201 P.3d 1220 (Colo. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       District attorney who had previously represented defendant did not have confidential information that could have been passed on to prosecutors because district attorney did not recall prior representation of defendant, did not perform any substantive work on case, and never received any information from defendant. People v. Perez, 201 P.3d 1220 (Colo. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       District attorney's previous representation of potential witness and possible alternate suspect did not constitute a special circumstance. District attorney who aided preliminary investigation and who had previously represented potential witness and possible alternate suspect did not have confidential information and left the office before charges were filed. People v. Perez, 201 P.3d 1220 (Colo. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Discovery violation not a special circumstance warranting disqualification. For allegedly inadequate witness list, trial court should impose the least restrictive sanction that preserves the truth-finding process, restores a level playing field, and deters prosecutorial misconduct, not disqualification. People v. Perez, 201 P.3d 1220 (Colo. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, funding arrangement whereby district attorney's office billed department of corrections for costs related to prosecuting crimes committed in a prison and department then forwarding reimbursements to counties was not a "special circumstance". District attorney's office did not obtain any intentional financial gain nor was there any double-billing. People v. Perez, 201 P.3d 1220 (Colo. 2009).

       <b>
     Facts showing an appearance of impropriety are no longer relevant in court's determination whether to disqualify a district attorney.
    </b>
    The general assembly amended the statute, eliminating the "appearance of impropriety" as a ground for disqualifying a district attorney. People v. Loper, 241 P.3d 543 (Colo. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     The "special circumstances" justifying disqualification of a district attorney must be extreme and must render it unlikely that a defendant would receive a fair trial.
    </b>
    The suspicious manner in which the charges were brought and the involvement and possible influence on the district attorney by a probation officer employed by the judicial department raises concerns of potential impropriety, but this evidence does not bear on whether defendant would be unlikely to receive a fair trial. People v. Loper, 241 P.3d 543 (Colo. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Court erred in disqualifying district attorney based on finding of "special circumstances".
       </b>
       The appearance of impropriety is no longer a valid reason for disqualifying a district attorney, and the ordered defense disclosure did not constitute extreme circumstances under the statute. People v. Kendrick, 2017 CO 82, 396 P.3d 1124.

      <p>
       <b>
        Appointment of special prosecutor constituted an abuse of discretion
       </b>
       where the only fact relied upon by the court was that one of the deputy district attorneys, not assigned to the case, was the brother of a state trooper who would be testifying in the case. People v. County Court, Jefferson County, 902 P.2d 413 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Trial court abused its discretion in finding the present appearance of impropriety sufficient to warrant removal of the district attorney and the capital crimes unit.
    </b>
    Where there are other remedies for the trial court to consider when timely, the remedy of disqualification for the appearance of impropriety in relationship to the victim's medical records is too severe. People v. Palomo, 31 P.3d 879 (Colo. 2001).

        When an indictment is procured by or with the assistance of a prosecuting attorney who is disqualified to conduct the prosecution or when an information is presented by a disqualified prosecuting attorney, it is invalid.

       Once the disqualification of a district attorney is entered and the appointment of a special prosecutor becomes effective, the special prosecutor, and only the special prosecutor, is the authorized prosecuting attorney on the case. People v. Hastings, 903 P.2d 23 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The scope of a special prosecutor's responsibility to prosecute cases after being appointed pursuant to this section includes not only the guilt phase of a case
       </b>
       but also the means adopted to impose punishment upon an offender. Therefore, only the special prosecutor was authorized to make determinations regarding the necessity of filing a motion to revoke a deferred judgment and sentence. People v. Hastings, 903 P.2d 23 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trial court does not have discretion in ruling on the disqualification of a prosecuting attorney where the district attorney has confessed a disqualification and a special prosecutor has already been appointed.
       </b>
       Trial court should have granted defendant's motion to dismiss even though disqualified district attorney's term of office was due to expire before a motion to revoke a deferred judgment and sentence filed by the district attorney was heard on the merits. The district attorney was not authorized to act after special prosecutor was appointed and an abuse of discretion standard of review has no application under these circumstances. People v. Hastings, 903 P.2d 23 (Colo. App. 1994).

      <p>
       <b>
     Where district attorney seeks to disqualify himself or herself, no evidentiary showing is required.
    </b>
    The statute only requires the filing of a motion by the district attorney. However, the standard is different when a defendant seeks to disqualify a district attorney; in that case, the defendant must show that the district attorney has a personal or financial interest in the case or that there are special circumstances that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial.

     Knowledge of deputies imputed to district attorney.
    </b>
    Deputies and assistant district attorneys function only by virtue of the district attorney's authority, and their knowledge and official actions are imputed to the district attorney for purposes of the compulsory joinder statute. Corr v. District Court, 661 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Deputy district attorneys are not "every other officer" for purposes of art. XII, § 9, because they are appointed not elected; thus, subsection (3) controls.
       </b>
       Subsection (3) requires that deputy district attorneys must file their oaths with the secretary of state. Leske v. Golder, 124 P.3d 863 (Colo. App. 2005).

     Purpose of section.
    </b>
    The general assembly intended that district attorney's offices should be staffed with such employees as are reasonably necessary to perform the duties incumbent on the district attorney. Johnson v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 174<cite class="co_code">Colo. 350</cite>, 483 P.2d 1344 (1971).

     The term "stenographer"
    </b>
    as used in this section is descriptive and not exclusive. Johnson v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 174<cite class="co_code">Colo. 350</cite>, 483 P.2d 1344 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Review of hiring and salary set by district attorney.
    </b>
    It would be an unreasonable interpretation of subsection (2) to declare that the county commissioners must rubber-stamp the hiring of an employee or the salary of the employees appointed by the district attorney. Johnson v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 174<cite class="co_code">Colo. 350</cite>, 483 P.2d 1344 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     The burden is upon the board of county commissioners,
    </b>
    if they choose to challenge the wisdom of the district attorney's decision to employ personnel to staff his office in accordance with subsection (2), to show that there is no reasonable necessity for such employment and that in employing personnel the district attorney acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and abused his discretion in making such appointment and in setting the salary for such appointed employee. Johnson v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 174<cite class="co_code">Colo. 350</cite>, 483 P.2d 1344 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Position of clerk-typist approved.
    </b>
    From the record the supreme court finds that the county commissioners failed to sustain their burden of proof and did not establish that the district attorney acted arbitrarily and capriciously in appointing a clerk-typist and in fixing her salary. The district attorney of a district having a population of less than 100,000 under the provisions of subsection (2) can hire a clerk-typist, in addition to a stenographer. Johnson v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 174<cite class="co_code">Colo. 350</cite>, 483 P.2d 1344 (1971).
