                        Code funding scheme constitutional. The counties retain sufficient control over the funds raised by levy under the code to be deemed the taxing authorities so that, since the levies fall uniformly upon the same class of property within each county, the
                        funding scheme does not violate the constitutional provision requiring uniformity of taxation. State Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 697 P.2d 1 (Colo. 1985).

                        County is agent of state board. The legislative scheme embodied in the Colorado social services code contemplates the county being an agent of the state board of social services rather than a separate entity of sufficient independent identity to qualify

                        Section does not compel state board to adopt wage schedule submitted by a county for its social service employees. Evert v. Ouren, 37

                        Or to provide salaries identical to prevailing rate. This section does not require that the state board provide salaries in every respect identical with those prevalent in a particular area. Evert v. Ouren, 37

                    <p>
                        Section merely establishes a standard for the state board to follow in setting the salaries of social services employees, directing the state board to consider prevailing wages within each respective region as an initial or starting point for calculation.

                        It leaves to the state board the task of preparing wage schedules, and does not empower a county to do anything more than submit suitable data for the state board's consideration. Evert v. Ouren, 37

                        The state board is entrusted with the ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the fiscal affairs of the social services system. Evert v. Ouren, 37

                        Discretion of board. This section grants to the state board a considerable degree of discretion in determining wage schedules for employees of the social services system. Evert v. Ouren, 37

                        Factor in establishing wage schedules. If appropriations for the funds for the wages of county social services employees are insufficient in a given year, it is fully within the discretion accorded the state board in subsection (2) to consider this as
                        a factor in establishing wage schedules. Evert v. Ouren, 37

                        County board is arm of state. The county board of social services is set up as a subordinate agency or arm of the state. It is bound by, inter alia, the fiscal and personnel rules set up by the state board of social services. Martin v. District Court,

                        County board is without standing to challenge action of state board. In the absence of an express statutory right, the county board lacks standing or any other legal authority to obtain judicial review of an action of the merit system council. Martin

                        Right to judicial review limited. The right to judicial review of the final administrative actions of the state board of social services is limited to those parties to the proceeding before the administrative agency whose rights, privileges, or duties,

                        County is arm of state. A county, as used in this section, is assigned its traditional role as an arm of the state, existing only for the convenient administration of the state government and to carry out the will of the state. Bd. of County Comm'rs v.

                        It is clear that the county departments of social services, and the merit system council, are both functional divisions of the state department of social services for the convenient administration of the state program and are not independent entities
                        separate and distinct from the state. Nadeau v. Merit Sys. Council, 36

                        The county board of social services is set up as a subordinate agency or arm of the state. It is bound by, inter alia, the fiscal and personnel rules set up by the state board of social services. Martin v. District Court, 191

                        County has no standing to seek review of state board's action. A county department of social services has no standing to seek judicial review of action by the state board of social services by the merit system council. Nadeau v. Merit Sys. Council, 36

                        In the absence of an express statutory right, the county board lacks standing or any other legal authority to obtain judicial review of an action of the merit system council. Martin v. District Court, 191

                        Where the state board of social services is a party to judicial review proceedings, as a result of which a settlement agreement was reached, reinstating an employee suspended by a county department of social services, the county board and the county department,
                        as subordinates of the state agency, are bound by the state department's action settling the judicial review proceedings. Accordingly, the county board and the county department are without standing to seek judicial review of the
                        merit system council's order implementing the settlement agreement, and the board of county commissioners is likewise without standing to seek judicial review. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Merit Sys. Council, 662 P.2d 1093 (Colo. App.

                        county or form a district to provide such a merit system for its employees. The county department shall certify to the state department that the successor merit system of personnel administration used by the county is in conformance
                        with the federal standards. Prior to transferring county employees to a successor merit system, each county shall submit a transition plan to the state department outlining its plan for transferring such employees and for addressing
                        issues that may arise during the transfer, such as salary issues, retention, seniority rights, and appeal processes. The state department shall examine and approve the transition plan if the state department determines that the
                        transition plan is reasonable and that the merit system meets the federal standards. The county may not implement the transition plan or transfer employees to the successor merit system until the state department has approved the
                        transition plan. The state shall not unreasonably withhold approval. Any transition plan for transferring county employees from the state merit system to a successor merit system shall include protections for employees that allow
                        them to retain any accrued annual or sick leave benefits and that compensate such employees at the same or higher rate of salary. The state department shall provide assistance to counties regarding the transition of county employees
                        from the state merit system to a successor merit system. Nothing in this section shall preclude a county from reorganizing employee staff functions or abolishing positions to achieve greater efficiencies in operations.

                        Code funding scheme constitutional. The counties retain sufficient control over the funds raised by levy under the code to be deemed the taxing authorities so that, since the levies fall uniformly upon the same class of property within each county, the
                        funding scheme does not violate the constitutional provision requiring uniformity of taxation. State Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 697 P.2d 1 (Colo. 1985).

                        Financing provisions of social services code not violative of equal protection because a rational relationship exists between the requirement that local entities must support a portion of the costs of programs serving the disadvantaged within their localities

                        County's share of payments under this section are not a "subsidy." Attempted turnback by county of its responsibilities under human services code pursuant to art. X, § 20(9), of the state constitution was invalid because when a county (itself a political
                        subdivision of the state) attempts to subsidize the state, the state, through the county, contributes to itself. Romer v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, Weld County, 897 P.2d 779 (Colo. 1995).

                    Editor's note: This section was originally enacted in 2004; however section 2 of chapter 328, Session Laws of Colorado 2004, provided that this section would only take effect if the department of human services provided written notice to the revisor of
                    statutes that potential partners for a merger with the Colorado mental health institute were identified. No such notification was received by the revisor of statutes, therefore this section as it appeared in the 2004 Colorado Revised
                    Statutes did not take effect.

                        One of primary purposes of home care allowance program is to keep recipients independent and, if possible, to prevent their placement in nursing homes. Department of social services' new eligibility rules, which changed agency's longstanding interpretation
                        of subsection (2)(a), conflicted with both the letter and the intent of home care allowance statutes and were therefore ineffective. Adams v.

                        Evidence insufficient to establish deduction from pension. The production of records of the gross earnings of one other than the old age pension applicant and nothing more falls far short of evidence to establish the amount, if any, to be deducted from

                                        Completing the application process for federal disability benefits is onerous. The application is complex and requires applicants to compile past medical records from medical providers. Applicants must also navigate the process while contending with debilitating
                                        mental and physical health conditions, and, for aid to the needy disabled program participants, the additional barrier of extreme poverty.

                                        Despite the extreme need for federal disability benefits, applicants who are ultimately determined to be eligible for federal disability benefits are often denied multiple times;

                                        Delayed access to federal disability benefits often creates or prolongs homelessness or puts individuals at risk of homelessness. Fifty-seven percent of Colorado's chronically homeless population are persons with disabilities.

                                        Delayed access to federal disability benefits puts Coloradans with disabilities at increased risk of health crisis. Nationally, in federal fiscal year 2016, over ten thousand people died waiting to be approved for federal disability benefits.

                                        Assistance in applying for federal disability benefits significantly improves the rate of approval of initial applications and therefore reduces the time it takes for individuals to access federal disability benefits; and

                    (II) The state aid to the needy disabled program provides two hundred seventeen dollars per month to individuals who cannot work due to a severe disability while the individuals are applying for federal disability benefits. With only two hundred seventeen
                    dollars per month in income, aid to the needy disabled program participants struggle to meet their most basic needs. As a consequence, these participants are often homeless, in crisis, and unable to engage in sickness prevention or
                    health maintenance activities, resulting in high-cost emergency room visits or other high-cost medical treatment.

                                        Every county department or service delivery agency shall adopt procedures for the resolution of disputes arising between the county department or the service delivery agency and any applicant for or recipient of
                                        public assistance prior to appeal to the state department. Such procedures are referred to in this section as the "dispute resolution process". Two or more counties may jointly establish the dispute resolution process.

                                        program. The state board shall adopt rules setting forth what other issues, if any, may be appealed by an applicant or recipient to the state department. County notices to applicants or recipients shall inform them

                                        in the manner and form prescribed by the rules of the state department. Every county department or service delivery agency shall adopt procedures for the resolution of disputes arising between the county department
                                        or the service delivery agency and any applicant for or recipient of public assistance prior to appeal to the state department. Such procedures are referred to in this section as the "dispute resolution process".
                                        Two or more counties may jointly establish the dispute resolution process. The dispute resolution process shall be consistent with rules promulgated by the state board pursuant to article 4 of title 24, C.R.S. The

                        any increase in income, the recipient shall notify the county department of the possession of such property or receipt of such income, and the county department may either terminate the public assistance or alter the amount of
                        assistance payments in accordance with the circumstances and the rules of the state department. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, if the recipient is found to have committed an intentional program

                        for ordinary and necessary living expenses or would be against equity and good conscience. Overpayments in all cases involving a grant of aid to families with dependent children shall be recovered from the caretaker relative in

                        than thirty-five dollars. Where the overpayment amount owed by an individual no longer receiving public assistance is thirty-five dollars or more, the state department and the county departments may determine, consistent with the
                        six-year time limitation for the execution on judgments involving state debt, that it is no longer cost-effective to continue to pursue recovery of the overpayment. The state department and the county departments shall not pursue
                        overpayment collection activities against children who have been part of a Colorado works program assistance unit.

                    The state department is authorized to adopt rules and regulations for the provision of optional state supplementation to recipients of SSI benefits residing in the state, within available appropriations, in accordance with Title XVI of the social security
                    act and this part 2. Such benefits may be provided pursuant to part 1 of this article if the individual meets the eligibility requirements established under such part 1. SSI benefits received must be considered as income in determining
                    eligibility under part 1 of this article. Eligibility for and the amount of such payments shall be fixed by the state board. If the federal government makes a final determination that any such payments must be considered as income
                    in determining eligibility for SSI benefits, the state board shall terminate such payments.

                    than twenty percent.

                                Colorado has already demonstrated the value of transitional jobs through its successful HIRE Colorado initiative. Operated with federal funds from October 2009 through September 2010, HIRE Colorado provided transitional jobs to over one thousand seven
                                hundred unemployed Coloradans, enabling them to do productive, wage-paying work for local governments, nonprofit agencies, and for-profit employers. According to data from the Colorado department of human services, HIRE
                                Colorado helped nearly seventy-five percent of its participants to move into unsubsidized employment. In states whose transitional jobs programs focused on those with the most acute job search challenges, nearly fifty percent,
                                an unusually high success rate for such a population, moved into unsubsidized work.

                                While nationally unemployment is falling slowly and although Colorado's unemployment rate is better than the national average, Coloradans still face difficulty in finding full-time jobs. According to a recent analysis, nearly two hundred thousand Coloradans
                                are "officially" unemployed, but there are fewer than seventy-five thousand job openings. At the same time that unemployed and underemployed Coloradans struggle to find employment in the face of this job shortage, many
                                employers have found it difficult to fill the job vacancies they do have. Transitional jobs are part of the solution to both unemployment and unfilled job vacancies.

                        The general assembly finds and declares that individuals receiving care and services from persons employed in programs or facilities described in subsection (7) of this section or from persons appointed to be a conservator or guardian of an at-risk adult
                        are vulnerable to mistreatment, including abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It is the intent of the general assembly to minimize the potential for employment of, or appointment as conservators or guardians, persons with a history
                        of mistreatment of at-risk adults in positions that would allow those persons unsupervised access to these adults. As a result, the general assembly finds it necessary to strengthen protections for vulnerable adults by requiring
                        certain employers and the courts to request a CAPS check by the state department to determine if a person who will provide direct care to an at-risk adult or who may be appointed as a conservator or guardian for an at-risk adult
                        has been substantiated in a case of mistreatment of an at-risk adult. The general assembly also finds that it is necessary to require that certain employers cooperate with, and provide access to, county departments during county
                        investigations of mistreatment of at-risk adults pursuant to section 26-3.1-103 (1.3).

                        The general assembly finds and declares that increasing numbers of children in Colorado are spending a significant portion of their day in care settings outside their own homes. In addition, some children are placed in facilities for residential care
                        for their protection and well-being. The general assembly finds that regulation and licensing of child care facilities contribute to a safe and healthy environment for children. The provision of such environment affords benefits
                        to children, their families, their communities, and the larger society. The general assembly acknowledges that there is a need to balance accessibility and quality of care when regulating child care facilities. It is the intent
                        of the general assembly that those who regulate and those who are regulated work together to meet the needs of the children, their families, and the child care industry.

                        In balancing the needs of children and their families with the needs of the child care industry, the general assembly also recognizes the financial demands with which the department of human services is faced in its attempt to ensure a safe and sanitary
                        environment for those children of the state of Colorado who are in child care facilities. In an effort to reduce the risk to children outside their homes while recognizing the financial constraints placed upon the department, it
                        is the intent of the general assembly that the limited resources available be focused primarily on those child care facilities that have demonstrated that children in their care may be at higher risk pursuant to section 26-6-107.

                                Notwithstanding subsection (1)(a) of this section to the contrary, the availability of safe, affordable, and licensed family child care homes is a matter of statewide concern. Therefore, permitting fragmented regulation among jurisdictions impedes and
                                infringes upon the department's appropriate and consistent licensing and regulation of family child care homes throughout the state. Accordingly, local governing authorities shall treat family child care homes as residential
                                property use in the application of local regulations, including zoning, land use development, fire and life safety, sanitation, and building codes. Local governing authorities shall not impose any additional regulations
                                governing family child care homes that do not also apply to other residential properties, provided that the foregoing does not restrict an authority's ability to prohibit, on a case-by-case basis, the operation in immediately
                                adjacent residences of two or more large family child care homes, as that term is defined by rules by the department that governs the operation of family child care homes, or to manage the flow of traffic and parking related

                                        The general assembly hereby finds that an audit completed by the state auditor's office in 1995 reported that the state department had not properly and timely carried out all of its child care facility licensing functions due to insufficient staff. The
                                        general assembly further finds that, in an effort to use the state department's limited child care resources more effectively and efficiently, it passed legislation in 1996 implementing a risk-based approach to
                                        inspecting and monitoring child care facilities in place of the mandatory biennial reviews of every facility. The general assembly finds that it was determined in a follow-up audit conducted by the state auditor's
                                        office in 1998, that the state department was still at least one month late in conducting inspections of approximately twenty-two percent of the child care facilities in Colorado. In addition, of those facilities
                                        assigned a high risk factor and thereby requiring inspections more frequently than every twelve months, twenty-six percent were at least three months past due. In evaluating the implementation of the risk-based
                                        approach to inspection and monitoring of child care facilities, the general assembly finds that the implementation of this approach has actually increased the state department's workload by approximately sixteen
                                        percent. (2) (a) (I) The general assembly hereby finds that an audit completed by the state auditor's office in 1995 reported that the state department had not properly and timely carried out all of its child care
                                        facility licensing functions due to insufficient staff. The general assembly further finds that, in an effort to use the state department's limited child care resources more effectively and efficiently, it passed

                                        The general assembly further finds that a national study conducted by the center for career development in early care and education at Wheelock College concluded that Colorado's child care facility licensing staff had caseloads of approximately two hundred

                                        within the division greatly exceed the number of cases recommended by the national association for the education of young children, which organization has recommended that child care regulators' caseloads should

                                        the department is unable to respond promptly and conduct an on-site investigation of the complaint.

                                        The general assembly hereby determines that the health and safety of the children of the state of Colorado in child care facilities is of utmost concern and importance to the state. The general assembly further finds that the timely and proper inspection
                                        of child care facilities and prompt responses to serious complaints about a child care facility are priorities and that, in order to facilitate such timely inspections and responses to complaints, the state department

                                        that it is in the best interests of the citizens of the state of Colorado that the number of persons contracted for and charged with the duty of inspecting, monitoring, and responding to complaints in child care

                    is required to be licensed under this part 1. If the person does not have a valid license pursuant to this part 1, the person's license has been revoked pursuant to section

                    in violation of the law, then such person is providing unlicensed and illegal child care. At the time the department applies for an injunction, the department shall notify law enforcement of the injunction proceedings. If it is established
                    that the defendant has been or is so operating such facility without a valid license, the court shall enter a decree enjoining the defendant from further operating the facility unless and until the person obtains a license therefor.

                        The general assembly finds that changes in demographics and economic trends in Colorado have increased the need for high quality and affordable child care. The general assembly also recognizes that the provision of child care in this state and in the

                        care centers, family child care homes, and foster care homes that includes the adequate and full participation of parents, consumers, child care providers, and interested persons. The general assembly finds that such a review with

                                In Colorado, this additional cost burden has forced ten percent of the state's child care providers to close their doors since March 2020. Almost three-quarters of all child care providers indicate they have or will engage in layoffs, furloughs, or pay
                                cuts. For minority-owned or operated child care providers, this figure is even higher. More than twenty-five percent of existing child care providers report that closure is imminent without some kind of financial intervention.

                                Statewide, enrollment in child care for children less than five years of age has decreased by thirty-nine percent since the COVID-19 public health emergency began.

                        The general assembly hereby finds that, in order to adequately care for their newborns and young children, new mothers may often benefit from receiving professional assistance and information. Without such assistance and information, a young mother may
                        develop habits or practices that are detrimental to her health and well-being and the health and well-being of her child. The general assembly further finds that inadequate prenatal care and inadequate care in infancy and early
                        childhood often inhibit a child's ability to learn and develop throughout his or her childhood and may have lasting, adverse effects on the child's ability to function as an adult. The general assembly recognizes that implementation
                        of a nurse home visitor program that provides educational, health, and other resources for new young mothers during pregnancy and the first years of their infants' lives has been proven to significantly reduce the amount of drug,
                        including nicotine, and alcohol use and abuse by mothers, the occurrence of criminal activity committed by mothers and their children under fifteen years of age, and the number of reported incidents of child abuse and neglect.
                        Such a program has also been proven to reduce the number of subsequent births, increase the length of time between subsequent births, and reduce the mother's need for other forms of public assistance. It is the intent of the general
                        assembly that such a program be established for the state of Colorado, beginning with a limited number of participants and expanding by the year 2010 to be available to all low-income, first-time mothers in the state who consent
                        to receiving services.

                        The general assembly further finds that, to implement such a program efficiently and effectively and to promote the successful implementation of partnerships between state public entities and the private sector, responsibility for the program should be
                        divided between the state department, which shall be responsible for financial administration of the program, and a health sciences facility at the university of Colorado, which shall be responsible for programmatic and clinical
                        support, evaluation, and monitoring for the program, and such other responsibilities as described in this article. It is the intent of the general assembly that the state department and the health sciences facility work collaboratively
                        to share information in order to promote efficient and effective program implementation; however, neither entity is responsible for the other entity's statutorily prescribed duties.

                                        the state department for implementing subsection (2)(a.5) of this section shall not exceed two percent of the amount annually appropriated from the fund for the program, and the portion of such costs to compensate
                                        the health sciences facility under section 26-6.4-105 (3), as set forth in the scope of work in the contract between the state department and the health sciences facility, shall not exceed three percent of the amount
                                        annually appropriated from the fund for the program. In addition, if the total amount annually appropriated from the fund for the program exceeds nineteen million dollars, the state department and the health sciences
                                        facility shall assess whether a smaller percentage of the appropriated funds exceeding nineteen million dollars is adequate to cover their actual costs and shall jointly submit to the general assembly a report articulating
                                        their conclusions on this subject. The actual costs of the state department include state department personnel and operating costs and any necessary transfers to the department of health care policy and financing
                                        for administrative costs incurred for the medicaid program associated with the program. The actual costs of the health sciences facility include the facility's own actual program costs and those of its contractors
                                        and subcontractors. Any costs for time studies required to obtain medicaid reimbursement for the program may be paid from program funds and are not subject to the five percent limit in this section. Notwithstanding
                                        section 24-36-114, all interest derived from the deposit and investment of money in the fund shall be credited to the fund. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2)(b)(II) of this section, all unexpended and

                        The general assembly hereby finds and declares that there is a critical need to increase services for young children and their families, including those families with members who are entering the workforce due to Colorado's reform of the welfare system,
                        making the transition off of welfare, or needing child care assistance to avoid the welfare system. The statewide need includes increasing and sustaining the quality, accessibility, capacity, and affordability of services for children
                        and their parents to help parents raise their children to be successful at school, at work, and in the community.

                        Research demonstrates that there are positive outcomes for young children and their families who receive quality, integrated child care and related services in their early, preschool years, delivered through a comprehensive early childhood system that
                        includes quality care and education, family support, health, and mental health programs.

                        Providers of half-day preschool and full-day child care services have to overcome barriers and inflexible requirements of the various sources of funding in order to design and implement programs that are more responsive to the needs of working families.

                        Consideration of various state and federal funding sources would allow for an integrated delivery system of quality programs for young children and their families in Colorado's communities.

                    <li id="t26-ar6.5-s26-6.5-101ol15">
                        An integrated delivery system would further enhance the ability of the state department to identify the best practices relative to increasing and sustaining quality and to meeting the diverse needs of families seeking child care and other early childhood
                        services.

                        It is therefore in the state's best interest to establish a comprehensive system of early childhood councils to increase and sustain the availability, accessibility, capacity, and quality of early childhood services throughout the state, as provided in

                <p>
                    The state department shall develop and maintain a statewide voluntary child care credentialing system that recognizes the training and educational achievements of persons providing early childhood care and education. The use of the voluntary child care
                    credentialing system must include but need not be limited to the early childhood councils. The voluntary child care credentialing system is a multi-tiered system of graduated credentials that reflects the increased training, education,
                    knowledge, skills, and competencies of persons working in early childhood care and education services in the various councils. The voluntary child care credentialing system must award credit for the education and training of persons
                    working in early childhood care and education concerning the prevention of child sexual abuse. Such education and training includes understanding healthy child development, creating safe environments for children, recognizing signs
                    of abuse and problematic behaviors, and responsible methods of response to disclosures or concerns of abuse or potential abuse. The state board shall promulgate such rules as are necessary for the statewide implementation of the voluntary
                    child care credentialing system.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Subject to available appropriations, there is hereby created in the state department the Colorado infant and toddler quality and availability grant program. Grants are awarded through the Colorado shines system to improve quality in licensed infant and
                    toddler care and increase the number of low-income infants and toddlers served through high-quality early childhood education programs, as well as promote voluntary family partnerships, as determined for the Colorado shines system.
                    A program is considered "high-quality" if it is rated in the top three levels of the state's Colorado shines system. Early childhood councils may apply for money through the state department, which administers the program as part of
                    the Colorado shines system. An early childhood education program that is within the service area of an early childhood council may apply to the early childhood council for money that would allow the program to increase the number of
                    infants and toddlers living in low-income families served through high-quality early childhood education programs.

                                The general assembly hereby finds and declares that mentoring programs such as big brothers, big sisters, and partners have been active in Colorado for many years. The general assembly finds that national research has indicated that structured mentoring
                                programs are effective tools in combating youth substance abuse and youth crime and violence. The general assembly further finds, based upon recent national research results, that at-risk youth who are matched in a minimum
                                of year-long mentoring relationships are less likely to become involved in substance and alcohol abuse, less likely to be truant, less likely to commit violent acts against other persons, and more likely to show improvements
                                in academic performance and positive peer relations.

                                The general assembly further finds that, despite the positive results that may be achieved through structured youth mentoring programs, as many as thirty-eight counties in the state of Colorado do not have the organizational resources necessary to carry
                                out successful mentoring programs or lack the adult volunteers to establish such programs or both. The general assembly finds that even counties in which there are established youth mentoring programs, such programs are
                                unable to meet the demand for mentors and that such established programs have waiting lists that exceed two thousand youths.

                                and in the best interests of the citizens of the state of Colorado.

                        conflict, association with peers who commit crimes, residence in a single-parent household, exhibition of indicia of delinquent behavior, or being the victim of child abuse.

                    portion of the total number of incidents of domestic abuse; that a large percentage of police officer deaths in the line of duty result from police intervention in domestic abuse situations; and that domestic abuse is a complex problem
                    affecting families from all social and economic backgrounds. It is the purpose of this article to encourage the development of domestic abuse programs by units of local government and nongovernmental agencies.

                    The general assembly hereby finds that there are a growing number of persons in this state who lack the resources and the community ties necessary to provide for their own adequate shelter and who are likely to become homeless without community assistance.
                    The general assembly recognizes that women and children are the fastest growing group of the homeless and that a large percentage of the total homeless population consists of families. The general assembly therefore finds that it is
                    beneficial to the state to fund prevention activities programs to assist families and other persons who are likely to become homeless without some community assistance; that this article is enacted to provide a means by which such
                    programs may be financed through a voluntary contribution designation on state income tax return forms; and that it is desirable to encourage residents of this state to designate the amount of such contribution to help fund such prevention
                    activities programs on their state income tax return forms.

                        The general assembly hereby finds and declares that older Coloradans constitute a fundamental resource of this state. Often, their competence, experience, and wisdom are underutilized, and a means must be found to use their abilities more effectively
                        for the benefit of all Coloradans. The number of persons in this state sixty years of age or older is increasing rapidly, and, of these persons, the number of women, minorities, and persons seventy-five years of age or older is
                        expanding at an even greater rate. Among those persons seventy-five years of age or older, there is a higher incidence of functional disability. The social and health problems of older people are compounded by the lack of access
                        to existing services and by the unavailability of a complete range of services in all areas of the state. The ability of older people to maintain self-sufficiency and personal well-being with the dignity to which their years of
                        labor entitle them and to realize their maximum potential as creative and productive individuals are matters of profound importance and concern for all Coloradans.

                        The general assembly further declares that it is the policy of this state: To protect older Coloradans from abuse, neglect, or exploitation; to involve older Coloradans in the planning and operation of all programs and services that may affect them; to
                        encourage agencies at all levels of government, as well as in the private sector, to develop alternative services and forms of care that would provide a range of services to be delivered in the community and in the home and that
                        would facilitate access to other services which support independent living and prevent unnecessary institutionalization; to give priority in planning services and programs to those older Coloradans with the greatest economic need
                        or the greatest social need; and to facilitate and encourage joint program planning and policy development among state and local agencies which recognize and strengthen the community and personal support networks to which people
                        belong and on which they depend and which administer programs and deliver services to the older population.

                        There is hereby created in the state department the Colorado commission on the aging, referred to in this article as the "commission", which shall consist of seventeen members appointed by the governor, with the consent of the senate. Two members shall
                        be appointed from each congressional district of the state, one of whom shall be from each major political party, and, after July 1, 1976, and thereafter when a vacancy occurs, one of such members shall be from west of the continental
                        divide. A vacancy on the commission occurs whenever any member moves out of the congressional district from which he or she was appointed. Any member who moves out of such congressional district shall promptly notify the governor
                        of the date of such move, but such notice is not a condition precedent to the occurrence of the vacancy. The governor shall fill the vacancy as provided in subsection (2) of this section. Appointments made to take effect on January
                        1, 1983, shall be made in accordance with section 24-1-135, C.R.S. No more than nine members of the commission shall be members of the same major political party. One member shall be appointed from the state at large, one member
                        shall be appointed from among the membership of the senate, and one member shall be appointed from among the membership of the house of representatives. Appointments to the commission shall comply with the requirements of the rules
                        and regulations of the United States department of health and human services promulgated pursuant to Public Law 93-29, known as the "Older Americans Comprehensive Services Amendments of 1973", as such rules and regulations appear
                        in section 903.50 (c) of title 45 of the code of federal regulations. In making appointments to the commission, the governor is encouraged to include representation by at least one member who is a person with a disability, a family
                        member of a person with a disability, or a member of an advocacy group for persons with disabilities, provided that the other requirements of this subsection (1) are met.

                        appointments. Whenever a member of the senate or house of representatives serving as a member of the commission ceases to hold his office in the senate or house of representatives, a vacancy on the commission shall occur, and the
                        governor shall fill the vacancy by the appointment of a similarly qualified person who at the time is holding office, as the case may be, in the senate or house of representatives.

                        Section to be read in light of estate administration provisions. This section should be read in connection with the statutes relating to administration of estates, so that they may be harmonized, if practicable. In cases where inmates of the home have
                        died intestate, leaving no debts, and leaving articles of personal property of a value not sufficient to cover the cost of administration, the officers of the home doubtless were at a loss to know what to do with such property.
                        Lacking authority to pass title, they could not sell it. This section was intended to apply in such a situation. It was not intended to apply where the property left was sufficient to justify administration, particularly where
                        there are creditors. It is unreasonable to suppose that the general assembly intended, where an inmate leaves property of substantial value, that the property may be sold by the officers of the home and the proceeds, in default
                        of heirs, placed to the credit of the general fund of the home, regardless of the claims of creditors. In re Estate of McManis, 94

                        The general assembly hereby finds that while it is beneficial to the children of the state of Colorado to have procedures by which to enhance the establishment and enforcement of child support, some of which may include the collection and transmission
                        of certain informational data by electronic and other means, the general assembly also determines that it is equally important to prevent abuses of personal information and to safeguard the fundamental right of individuals to privacy.
                        To ensure the privacy of individuals against whom child support is to be established or enforced or on whose behalf it is to be collected, the general assembly hereby determines that it is appropriate that certain safeguards be
                        established.

                        The general assembly hereby declares that Colorado needs healthy and cohesive families at all income levels in order for the state to be economically viable. A number of families in communities throughout Colorado temporarily may not have access to the
                        basic necessities of life or to resources or services designed to promote individual development and family growth.

                        The general assembly further declares that many of Colorado's vulnerable families, individuals, children, and youth do not necessarily live in at-risk neighborhoods. Such persons may not have appropriate resources or sufficient income for adequate housing,
                        health care, or child care because the primary wage earners are unemployed, underemployed, or work at jobs that pay minimum wage or less. Further, many such persons not only live in poverty, but also experience divorce, domestic
                        violence, or are single parents. Children and youth who are raised in vulnerable families experience an increased risk of being abused, being illiterate, being undereducated, dropping out of school, becoming teen parents, abusing
                        drugs, and engaging in at-risk behaviors, including but not limited to criminal activities. Such children and youth are often influenced by and are likely to repeat behaviors that began with their parents.

                        Therefore, the general assembly finds that it is appropriate to establish a program to provide family resource centers in communities to serve as a single point of entry for providing comprehensive, intensive, integrated, and collaborative state and community-based
                        services to vulnerable families, individuals, children, and youth.

                    The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that a commission for the deaf, hard of hearing, and deafblind facilitates the provision of state and local government services to the deaf, hard of hearing, and deafblind while making government
                    more efficient. Under the federal "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990", 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101 et seq., as amended, Colorado has a duty to provide equivalent access to state government and public accommodations to the deaf, hard
                    of hearing, and deafblind. This duty requires state departments and agencies to provide auxiliary services, communications technology equipment, and other resources to ensure access. Centralizing and unifying such resources under a
                    Colorado commission creates cost savings for the state. In addition, the consolidation of resources facilitates quality control and increases the effectiveness of services while increasing access to services by the deaf, hard of hearing,
                    and deafblind.
