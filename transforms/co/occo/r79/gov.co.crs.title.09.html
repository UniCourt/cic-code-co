                    The purpose of this article is to prevent injury to persons and damage to property from accidents resulting from damage to underground facilities by excavation. This purpose shall be facilitated through the creation of a single statewide notification
                    system to be administered by an association of the owners and operators of underground facilities. Through the association, excavators shall be able to obtain crucial information regarding the location of underground facilities prior
                    to excavating and shall thereby be able to greatly reduce the likelihood of damage to any such underground facility or injury to any person working at an excavation site.

                    The alternative dispute resolution program must include mediation, arbitration, or other appropriate processes of dispute resolution. The issue of liability and amount of damages under Colorado law may be decided by an appointed arbitrator
                    or by the parties in mediation. Nothing in this section changes the basis for civil liability for damages.

                    At least ten days before beginning an excavation to remove an underground facility that is a gas transmission pipeline that has been abandoned or is unused and is not located in a public road, street, alley, or right-of-way dedicated to public use, the
                    excavator shall notify each owner of record and occupant of the real property where such underground facility is located. The notice shall state the commencement, extent, and duration of the excavation in addition to the information
                    required by section 9-1.5-103 (3)(c) and shall be served in the same manner as personal service under the Colorado rules of civil procedure; except that, if such personal service cannot be made through the use of due diligence, notice
                    may be served by mail to the owner's or occupant's last-known address. If a valid mailing address is not available through the use of due diligence, notice may be made by publication in a newspaper published in the county in which
                    the property is located. For purposes of this section, an underground facility is not considered abandoned or unused if it is in operation for its intended purpose or is being actively maintained with reasonable anticipation of a future
                    use.

                    The builder of any project regulated by this article shall create an implementation plan that guarantees the timely and evenly phased delivery of the required number of accessible units. Such plan shall clearly specify the number and type of units required

                    the jurisdiction having responsibility for enforcement may grant exceptions to this requirement. The implementation plan shall be approved by the governmental unit responsible for enforcement before a building permit is issued.

                    The general assembly hereby declares that the purpose of this article 7 is to provide for safety inspections to assure suitable control of the procurement of and access to explosives and, at the same time, to avoid undue limitations upon the manufacture,
                    sale, transport, or legitimate use of explosives. To avoid a duplication of supervision, inspection, and enforcement by various governmental agencies, no person, firm, partnership, or corporation that is subject to regulation under
                    articles 20 to 54 of title 34, C.R.S., or 30 CFR 56, 57, 75, or 77 shall be subject to this article 7. Fireworks subject to part 20 of article 33.5 of title 24 shall not be subject to regulation under this article 7.
