        Definition of "motor vehicle" in this section did not apply to road grader operating on highway and fell within the motor vehicle exception to the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act.

       Definition of "motor vehicle" in this section includes a snowplow.

       A vehicle does not have to transport both "persons and property" to meet the definition of "motor vehicle" in this section.
       
       Such an interpretation would exclude a vehicle that only transports people or that only transports property over the public highways, which would be absurd and unreasonable. A vehicle that transports either persons or property over the public highways may qualify as a "motor vehicle". Roper v. Carneal,

       Use of "county" with "municipal" indicates intent for county to have police powers.
       
       The fact that the term "county" was included in this section along with "municipal" units indicates that the general assembly intended such county governmental units, functioning through their boards of county commissioners, to have at least certain police powers.

      In any administrative proceeding for a revocation of a driver's license pursuant to article 2 of this title, where the hearing officer is engaged in finding facts and applying law for an incident or offense reported directly to the department by a law enforcement officer, and where the revocation was not triggered in whole or in part by a record of a conviction, the driver may challenge the validity of the law enforcement officer's initial contact with the driver and subsequent arrest of the driver. If a driver so challenges the validity of the law enforcement officer's initial contact, and the evidence does not establish that the initial contact or arrest was constitutionally and statutorily valid, the driver is not subject to license revocation.

       The general assembly finds, determines, and declares that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t42a02p01s42-2-105.5ol11a">
         Teenage drivers, in order to become safe and responsible drivers, need behind-the-wheel driving experience before they can begin to drive without restrictions;

        <li id="t42a02p01s42-2-105.5ol11b">
         Providing additional behind-the-wheel training with a parent, guardian, or other responsible adult before obtaining a minor driver's license is the beginning of the young driver's accumulation of experience;

        <li id="t42a02p01s42-2-105.5ol11c">
         Once a teenage driver begins to drive without a parent, guardian, or other responsible adult in the vehicle, it is necessary to place restrictions on a teenage driver who holds a minor driver's license until such driver turns eighteen years of age in order to give that driver time to exercise good judgment in the operation of a vehicle while keeping that driver, his or her passengers, and the public safe;
        </li>
        <li id="t42a02p01s42-2-105.5ol11d">
         Penalties for the violation of these restrictions on minor drivers under eighteen years of age, including the assessment of points where they may not otherwise be assessed, should be sufficient to ensure that chronic violations would result in swift and severe repercussions to reinforce the importance of obeying the driving laws in order to keep the minor driver, his or her passengers, and the public safe.

        Legislative intent.
       </b>
       While granting minors under the age of 18 the opportunity to gain experience in driving an automobile and granting them the privilege of using the public highways, the general assembly sought by this section to safeguard against the indiscretions of the inexperienced, youthful driver by requiring a financially responsible adult to assume the liability for accidents negligently or willfully caused by the youth. This was done, first, with the hope, that, having assumed the liability, the parent or guardian would exercise some degree of control over the minor's driving habits, and, second, to insure that the innocent victim of such negligence would be compensated for his injuries. Bilsten v. Porter, 33 Colo. App. 208, 516 P.2d 656 (1973); Lahey v. Benjou, 759 P.2d 855 (Colo. App. 1988).

       The notification provisions of Colorado's traffic code are no more burdensome on nonresidents than residents and do not treat similarly situated classes of drivers differently. Accordingly, a nonresident driver is not denied equal protection of the laws by these provisions. Klingbeil v. State, Dept. of Rev., 668 P.2d 930 (

If service is personally made under this subsection (4), proof of such service of any notice or order may be made by sending a written notification of service in any form to the department. Such notification shall be an official record of the department under section 42-2-121.

       Due process standard for using penalty assessment as conviction.
       
       Through the provisions of subsection (3), the general assembly has mandated a minimum standard of due process which must be followed before payment of a penalty assessment may be used as a conviction for purposes of suspension or revocation of a driver's license pursuant to § 42-2-123 (1)(a).

        The term "convicted"
       </b>
       is specifically defined by statute as meaning "a sentence imposed following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or a verdict of guilty by the court or a jury." Rogers v. Dept. of Rev., 841 P.2d 369 (Colo. App. 1992).

       <b>
        Number of assessed points on summons deemed minimum standard of due process.
       </b>
       The requirement that the number of points to be assessed be stated in the summons is a minimum standard of due process established by the general assembly and applies to a municipal summons when a fine was paid before the municipal traffic violations bureau. Dunn v. Tice, 43 Colo. App. 55, 598 P.2d 530 (1979).

      <p>
       Failure of penalty assessment to contain statement of number of points

        Inadequate notices.
       </b>
       Where there is no statement in the penalty assessment notices advising defendant that his signature and payment of the fine constitute a plea of guilty or an acknowledgment of guilt, the notices do not comply with the mandatory requirements of this section, and defendant's acceptance of the notices in the form tendered and his payment of the fines stated therein may not be considered a conviction for which points may be assessed.

        Court must state points assessable before guilty plea.

       A traffic violation conviction is insufficient for the purpose of assessing points against the licensee where municipal court summons fails to state the number of points which could be assessed upon a plea of guilty. Dunn v. Tice, 43 Colo. App. 55, 598 P.2d 530 (1979).

       When points not assessable.

        Factors considered in suspension of motorist's license.

       The department of revenue did not err in considering both the municipal court conviction and the traffic points resulting therefrom in determining whether the motorist's license should be suspended, the length of that suspension, and whether a probationary license should be granted.

The department shall hold the hearing not less than thirty days after receiving such license and request through a hearing commissioner appointed by the executive director of the department, which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 24-4-105, C.R.S. After such hearing, the licensee may appeal the decision of the department to the district court as provided in section 42-2-135.

       Although under the implied consent law a person refusing to submit to a chemical test is subject to a mandatory revocation without any opportunity for a probationary license, while a person actually convicted of driving under the influence is subject to a mandatory revocation but nonetheless may apply for a probationary license, this disparity in treatment does not violate equal protection of the laws.

       The implied consent statute serves the distinct governmental purpose of facilitating citizen cooperation in achieving traffic safety by the use of the administrative sanction of revocation upon a refusal to submit to a test, while the statutory authorization for a probationary license is expressly directed towards the "alcohol and drug traffic driving education or treatment" of the convicted traffic offender.

        The phrase "without additional testimony" precludes a judgment on the grounds that the department of revenue failed to file a brief.

       Statute proscribing driving with a blood alcohol content in excess of set limit provides sufficient notice of proscribed conduct and is not unconstitutionally vague or violative of due process.
       
       The fact of having consumed a quantity of alcohol notifies a person he is in jeopardy of violating the law. Abundant available information tells amount of alcohol consumption necessary to reach specific blood alcohol content levels. Smith v. Charnes, 728 P.2d 1287 (

       Revocation occurred because defendant refused to take the test for blood alcohol and not because of the level of alcohol in his bloodstream.

       Classification of 18- to 21-year-olds not violative of equal protection.
       
       Where licensees assert that they have been denied the equal protection of the laws in violation of the fourteenth amendment because Colorado allows drivers in the age group of 18 to 21 years to accumulate only eight points prior to suspension, while drivers over 21 years are allowed 12 points before their licenses are suspended, and further assert that there is no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare of Colorado in the different treatment, statistical analyses of all accidents in Colorado in 1973, analyzed by age, fully justifies the different treatment mandated by the general assembly, and these figures clearly support the determination by the general assembly that drivers in the lower age groups demand closer supervision, to protect the public health and safety.

      Upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or a verdict of guilty by the court or a jury, to DUI or DUI per se, or, for a person under twenty-one years of age, to DUI, DUI per se, DWAI, or UDD, the court shall require the offender to immediately surrender the offender's driver's, minor driver's, or temporary driver's license or instruction permit to the court. The court shall forward to the department a notice of plea or verdict, on the form prescribed by the department, together with the offender's license or permit, not later than ten days after the surrender of the license or permit. Any person who does not immediately surrender the license or permit to the court, except for good cause shown, commits a class 2 misdemeanor traffic offense.

       Suspension of Colorado driving privileges applies to nonresident licensed elsewhere.
       
       A nonresident with a valid driver's license issued by his state of residence, whose Colorado driver's license or privilege to drive has been suspended, is not extended a privilege to drive in Colorado until the period of suspension has expired and the restoration fee has been paid.

        Driving status of "denied" continues until conditions met.
       </b>
       Before a person against whom an order of denial has been entered is entitled to operate a motor vehicle, he must reapply for a new license at the end of the period of denial, pay the restoration fee required by subsection (3), file proof of financial responsibility as required by § 42-7-406(1), and must be in receipt and possession of the new license. Unless and until these conditions are satisfied, his driving status as "denied" continues and he is subject to prosecution under § 42-2-130(1)(a) for driving under denial. People v.

       Right to drive does not automatically return following suspension.

       Court may not nullify limitation on right to postpone suspension.
       
       Where the general assembly, in the interest of public safety, has provided a reasonable limitation upon the right to secure postponement of the effective date of suspension of a driver's license by the director of revenue, requiring a showing of irreparable injury, the courts have no power to nullify by procedural rule the limitations so imposed, the function of the courts being limited to a review of the acts of the directors.

       Court's discretion limited to determination of irreparable injury.
       
       Under Rule 106(a)(4), C.R.C.P., the district court has no discretion whatever to determine that a driver has a right to a postponement of the effective date of a suspension order even though he makes no showing of irreparable injury. The only discretion the district court has under these circumstances is to determine whether "irreparable injury" would result if the director's order remains in effect pending review. Where no showing whatever is made on this question, there is nothing before the district court upon which its discretion could operate. Theobald v. District Court, 148

       Court's allowance of injunction would be in derogation of department's constitutional authority.
       
       By virtue of the authority of the constitution, it is the duty of the department of revenue to carry into effect the provisions of the revenue law which it is required to execute. They are of a governmental character. The sole object of the action commenced in the district court is to obtain an injunction to restrain the department from performing its duties. If this should be permitted in a direct proceeding, the result would be to directly subject executive officials to the jurisdiction of the courts when acting within their province and strip them of their constitutional powers. This is an authority that the judicial department cannot exercise in this manner, for the obvious reason that to concede it would be an assumption that the judicial was of superior authority to the executive department.

The risk remains present when the reason for a vehicle's inoperability is a temporary condition that can be quickly remedied. The "reasonably capable of being rendered operable" standard distinguishes between a vehicle that has simply run out of gas and one that is in a condition that renders it "totally inoperable".

       No court shall accept a plea of guilty to another offense from a person charged with a violation of subsection (1) of this section; except that the court may accept such a plea upon a good faith representation by the prosecuting attorney that there is not a prima facie case for the original offense.

       Upon receipt of notice of a conviction or deferred sentence under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall immediately suspend the commercial driver's license for the maximum period set forth in the United States federal regulations governing violations of out-of-service orders for commercial drivers and section 42-2-403 (1).

The department, upon notice to the person, shall hold a hearing as soon as practicable at the district office of the department closest to the residence of the person; except that, at the discretion of the department, all or part of the hearing may be conducted in real time by telephone or other electronic means in accordance with section 42-1-218.5.

         The only issues at such hearing are whether the driver was convicted of or received a deferred sentence for a violation of subsection (1) of this section and the appropriate length of suspension. If the driver was convicted, the license shall be suspended. The hearing officer may reduce the period of suspension based on findings at the hearing, including without limitation the circumstances of the violation, the prior driving record, and aggravating and mitigating factors. A hearing officer shall not reduce the suspension period below the minimum disqualification period imposed by 49 CFR 383.51.

       The purpose of requiring the name of the owner in the registration of a motor vehicle
       
       is for the proper identification of the registrant; it follows that a person is more readily identified by the name he habitually uses, and a regulation which requires an applicant to use a first name rather than an initial, which would actually hinder identification, contravenes the legislative intent and is unlawful.

And this section provides that the owner, upon filing an application for "registration", shall pay, among other fees, the "annual specific ownership tax on the vehicle for which the license is to issue". So, payment of the specific ownership tax is thereby necessarily tied into the act of filing an application for registration. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. E. J. Rippy &amp; Sons, 161

       Since § 42-3-106 is similar to § 42-3-106 as it existed prior to the 2005 amendment to article 3 of title 42, which resulted in the relocation of provisions, relevant cases construing that provision and its predecessors have been included in the annotations to this section.

        The facial disparity in this section and § 42-3-107 between ownership tax rates applicable to interstate and intrastate vehicles ten years old and older violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution
       </b>
       where trucking company was able to show that the statutes discriminated against interstate commerce by unfairly imposing an economic disadvantage upon interstate carriers that operated vehicles subject to the tax. Riverton Produce Co. v. State, 871 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1994).

       <b>
        The court concluded that the discriminatory provisions of this section and § 42-3-107 were severable from the remainder of the statutes
       </b>
       where the discrimination in tax rates was not "inextricably intertwined" with the valid provisions and where severing the disparity between interstate and intrastate vehicles would not frustrate the legislature's efforts to raise revenue for the maintenance of its roads and highways.

       Specific ownership tax is in lieu of ad valorem taxes.
       
       The so-called specific ownership tax on motor vehicles and trailers authorized by this section is a tax directly fixed according to a prescribed method with reference to each particular vehicle by the statute itself, and is in lieu of any and all ad valorem taxes.

       The registration of vehicles is primarily a taxing scheme
       
       whereby the owner of a vehicle is assessed an annual fee in lieu of an ad valorem tax on his vehicle. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186

       Taxing scheme applies to vehicles to be operated on Colorado highways.
       
       The taxing scheme applies, with some exceptions, to all vehicles which are owned by Colorado residents and are primarily designed to be operated on Colorado highways. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186

       How this section implements taxing scheme.
       
       To implement the taxing scheme, this section provides for a pro rata credit of the registration tax when an owner of a registered vehicle transfers his interest in the vehicle. This transfer can be by operation of law. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186

        Annotator's note.
       </b>
       Since § 42-3-116 is similar to § 42-3-127 as it existed prior to the 2005 amendment to article 3 of title 42, which resulted in the relocation of provisions, relevant cases construing that provision and its predecessors have been included in the annotations to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Legislative intent in adopting subsection (1)
       </b>
       was to accommodate dealers by not requiring registration of each vehicle in the dealer's inventory and to permit dealers to operate their vehicles upon highways with the ease of transferring one license plate from one vehicle to another. Dept. of Rev. v. A &amp; A Auto Wrecking, Inc., 625 P.2d 1021 (Colo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There was no violation when a dealer illegally gave a purchaser a dealer plate.
       </b>
       The statute was enacted to collect taxes and not to protect the public. Liebelt v. Bob Penkhus Volvo-Mazda, Inc., 961 P.2d 1147 (Colo. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Department may not limit number of dealer licenses to one dealer.
       </b>
       A department of revenue regulation, limiting the number of dealer license plates that may be issued to an automobile dealer, is inconsistent with this section and is, therefore, invalid. A &amp; A Auto Wrecking, Inc. v. Dept. of Rev., 43 Colo. App. 85, 602 P.2d 10 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Dealer may not obtain unlimited number of plates.
       </b>
       Subsection (1) does not provide that a dealer may obtain an unlimited number of dealer plates, nor would such an interpretation lead to a just and reasonable result. Dept. of Rev. v. A &amp; A Auto Wrecking, Inc., 625 P.2d 1021 (Colo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Colorado appellate decisions support the proposition that nondelivery of the certificate of title to a motor vehicle does not prevent a change of ownership,
       </b>
       and that delivery of possession constitutes a transfer of ownership as between the parties involved. Hall v. Hong Seung Gee, 725 P.2d 1164 (Colo. App. 1986).

       in violation of this section, the troopers had a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was occurring. Although after stopping the vehicle, the troopers could see the plates well enough to discern that they were current, the continued obstruction of the plate constituted an ongoing license plate violation and thus a reasonable purpose for the stop. Because the troopers had a reasonable suspicion and a reasonable stop, they properly initiated an investigatory stop. People v. Altman, 938 P.2d 142 (Colo. 1997).

       </b>
       Since § 42-3-307 is similar to § 42-3-135 as it existed prior to the 2005 amendment to article 3 of title 42, which resulted in the relocation of provisions, a relevant case construing a former provision similar to that section has been included in the annotations to this section.

     <p>
      The general assembly recognizes the many conflicts which presently exist between the state's traffic laws and many of the municipal traffic codes, which conflicts lead to uncertainty in the movement of traffic on the state's highways and streets. These conflicts are compounded by the fact that today's Americans are extremely mobile and that while this state enjoys a large influx of traffic from many areas, there is some lack of uniformity existing between the "rules of the road" of this state and those of other states of the nation. The general assembly, therefore, declares it the purpose of this article to alleviate these conflicts and lack of uniformity by conforming, as nearly as possible, certain of the traffic laws of this state with the recommendations of the national committee of uniform traffic laws and ordinances as set forth in the committee's "Uniform Vehicle Code".

Courts should limit their inquiry to the relationship between the conduct of the emergency operator prior to the accident and the circumstances surrounding the conduct and important factors include, but are not limited to, the legal speed limit in the area, the speed at which the operator was driving, the conditions of the road, and the type of area in which the operator was driving.

       Since § 42-4-110 is similar to § 42-4-108 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42 as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing that provision have been included with the annotations to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section recognize the necessity for certain supplemental municipal traffic regulations
       
       and are a specific grant of authority to other than home-rule cities to impose additional controls not in conflict therewith where deemed locally necessary. City of Aurora v. Mitchell, 144
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 526

      </p>
      <p>
       Authority for home-rule city to regulate traffic constitutional.
       
       The authority for a home-rule city to regulate traffic speeds and penalize offenders is not found in the laws of the general assembly, but rather, is a matter of state constitutional law, under § 6 of art. XX, Colo. Const. People v. Hizhniak, 195
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 427
       </cite>
       , 579 P.2d 1131 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       State statute superseded by local ordinance in home-rule city.
       
       Assuming without deciding that a careless driving ordinance lacks conformity with the state statute, the latter is inoperative within the limits of the home-rule city. The ordinance has preempted the field in a "local and municipal matter" and the statutes of the state have been "superseded" by the ordinance adopted by the city. City of Aurora v. Mitchell, 144
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 526
       </cite>
       , 357 P.2d 923 (1960); People ex rel. City of Aurora v. Thompson, 165

       </cite>
       , 437 P.2d 537 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the home-rule amendment, once a matter is determined to be a matter of local and municipal concern, any local ordinance in a home-rule city addressing the matter will supersede a conflicting state statute. People v. Hizhniak, 195
       <cite class="co_code">

       <b>
        Local authority under subsection (1)(c).
       </b>
       As to those streets which are not state highways, a local authority may, pursuant to subsection (1)(c), adopt and enforce a local traffic ordinance which is in conflict with a state statutory traffic regulation covering the same subject matter. Mobell v. City &amp; County of Denver, 671 P.2d 433 (Colo. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Procedural protections.
       </b>
       Subsection (2) does no more than grant a municipality the authority to prosecute violations of its traffic ordinances through its own court system under a penalty scheme of its own choosing, but always consistent with the procedural protections accorded a defendant charged with violating a state statute proscribing the same conduct. City of Greenwood Vill. v. Fleming, 643 P.2d 511 (Colo. 1982).

      <p>
       "The same or similar offenses".
       
       Careless driving in violation of a municipal ordinance and driving under the influence in violation of a state statute do not constitute "the same or similar offenses" under subsection (3). Martinez v. People, 174

       The state's interests include consistent application of statewide laws to avoid patchwork bicycle regulations that may frustrate residents statewide as well as potentially affecting tourism, and the interests in improving the state's bicycle transportation infrastructure. On the other hand, municipalities have a valid interest in controlling traffic on their local streets. Webb v. City of Black Hawk, 2013 CO 9, 295 P.3d 480.

       This section permits all local authorities to regulate the speed of vehicles
       
       even though the state has its own statutes thereon except those highways designated as connecting links in the state highway system. Wiggins v. McAuliffe, 144

       This section does not give municipality the right to punish.
       
       This section recognizes the power of municipalities to regulate in particular areas of traffic and acknowledges the right of a municipality to regulate on subjects such as parking of vehicles, flow of traffic through control signs, creation of one-way streets, regulating speed and traffic at intersections, but it does not specifically approve the right of a municipality to punish the operator of a vehicle who drives without a license. Consequently, we must conclude that this authority has been preempted by the state and has been withheld from a municipality. Davis v. City &amp; County of Denver, 140

       Validity of legislation giving unrestricted discretion to local police.
       
       As a qualification of the general rule, where the discretion to be exercised relates to police regulations for the protection of public morals, health, safety, or general welfare, and it is impracticable to fix standards without destroying the flexibility necessary to enable the administrative officials to carry out the legislative will, legislation delegating such discretion without such restrictions may be valid.

       To be operated on a road, every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, and pole trailer and any other vehicle that is being drawn at the end of a train of vehicles must be equipped with at least one tail lamp mounted on the rear, which, when lighted as required in section 42-4-204, emits a red light plainly visible from a distance of five hundred feet to the rear; except that, in the case of a train of vehicles, only the tail lamp on the rear-most vehicle need actually be seen from the distance specified, except as provided in section 42-12-204. Furthermore, every vehicle registered in this state and manufactured or assembled after January 1, 1958, must be equipped with at least two tail lamps mounted on the rear, on the same level and as widely spaced laterally as practicable, which, when lighted as required in section 42-4-204, comply with this section.

        Question of fact as to whether failure to clean reflectors is negligent.
       </b>
       In an action for damages resulting from a collision between a stopped truck and an oncoming automobile, the question of whether, after passing beyond the rain area and before reaching the point of the accident, the driver of the truck had an opportunity to park off of the paved portion of the highway and again clean his reflectors and whether in failing so to do, he was guilty of negligence, at most presented a question of fact for the determination of the jury.

       <b>
        The plain language of this section indicates that "safety belt system" refers to all of the safety belts that have been installed in a motor vehicle
       </b>
       to restrain drivers and front seat passengers. The language of this section reflects that a motor vehicle may contain any number, type, or combination of belts within its "safety belt system". The term "safety belt system" does not mean the belts at a particular seat. Rather, a "safety belt system" is comprised of the many belts contained within a motor vehicle to restrain drivers and front seat passengers. Carlson v. Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because the language of subsection (2) does not include the term "system", the general assembly intended "safety belt" to refer to the belts that have been installed in a particular seat
       </b>
       pursuant to federal motor vehicle safety standards. Carlson v. Ferris, 85 P.3d 504 (Colo. 2003).

      <p>
       Driver is required to fasten all safety belts included in a motor vehicle's safety belt system

       A jury instruction regarding the affirmative defense of failure to wear a seatbelt

       State law does not take away city's power to regulate traffic.
       
       If a city has power under the state constitution to pass ordinances regulating vehicular traffic upon its streets, it cannot be deprived of that power by the passage of a state law. And if there is a conflict between statute and ordinance the ordinance controls. City &amp; County of Denver v. Henry, 95

        Question of contributory negligence measured by requirements of city ordinance.

       Thus, in action for injuries sustained in automobile accident at an intersection, the question of plaintiff's contributory negligence must be measured by the requirements of the city ordinance relating to right-of-way at intersections and not by this section, where there was a conflict.

       Insufficient evidence to charge contributory negligence.
       
       To properly apply the "look but not see" rule, as a matter of law, it is elemental that the approaching vehicle must be plainly visible and that the view of it must be unobstructed. If the evidence on these points is not clear or is disputed, then it remains a fact question for the trier of the facts to resolve. The effect of these findings by the trial court is that the evidence was insufficient to charge the defendant with contributory negligence when plaintiff negligently failed to yield right-of-way.

       This section contemplates two lines of traffic,
       
       and a main traveled roadway sufficient in width for their accommodation. The statute by its terms clearly requires the yielding, as nearly as possible, by each of two vehicles approaching each other, of at least one-half of the main traveled portion of the roadway. So far as the statute is explicit, the main traveled portion may be in the center, or on either side of the roadway. One-half of such traveled portion is exacted of each traveler, if it is possible to be given; if not, then as nearly as possible. Parrish v. Smith, 102
       <cite class="co_code">

       A situation might arise in which a strict compliance with these statutory requirements would be impossible.
       
       The reasonable provisions are indicated for roadways, and of course no fixed application thereof could be made to parts of a road under construction, where changing conditions would not permit orderly travel under established rules. Parrish v. Smith, 102
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which strict compliance with these statutory requirements would be impossible,
       
       then the ordinary rules are suspended. An ordinarily prudent traveler with any warning at all, in approaching a place of construction is bound to know that all rules of the road are suspended, and upon entering such an area be prepared -- for his own safety and that of others -- to submit to, and be governed by, conditions as he finds them. In such circumstances he cannot rely upon written traffic rules. Parrish v. Smith, 102

      </p>
      <p>
       Suspension of rules is question for jury.
       
       The question as to whether the physical condition of the roadway and its width were sufficient to permit a truck to yield one-half of the roadway to an automobile, as required by this section, is properly submitted to the jury. Parrish v. Smith, 108

       Forward automobile not required to turn further to right.

       Vehicles approaching an intersection must remain in or return to the right lane within 100 feet to remain free of negligence per se.
       
       Since operators of motor vehicles often make left turns at intersections and vehicles traveling in the same direction which attempt to pass the turning vehicle on its left may collide with it. This is true whether the passing vehicle is "driven to" or is "driven on" the left side of the highway; within 100, 200, or 300 feet before reaching the point of impact -- the intersection.

       Where the plaintiff, by his own admission was following a truck closer than 300 feet but his pickup truck was hit in the rear by another truck, the violation of this section was not actionable negligence unless it was a proximate cause of the accident. Gossard v. Watson, 122

        Speeding classifications constitutional.
       </b>
       Decision to treat higher rates of speeding as more serious making them criminal acts is within legislature's discretion and does not create a suspect class or infringe on a fundamental right. Drawing a distinction based on speed is rationally related to legislative purpose of safety and fuel conservation. People v. Lewis, 745 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the legislative intent of the general assembly in enacting the provisions of this section effective January 24, 1974,
       
       to fix a speed limit of 55 miles per hour for the period during which federal restrictions, as originated in the emergency highway energy conservation act, continued under the federal aid highway amendments of 1974, until such time as the general assembly took further action.

      </p>
      <p>
       The general assembly clearly intended to enact an enforceable 55 mile-per-hour maximum speed limit, because maintenance of federal highway funding was contingent upon enactment of such a statute. Olinyk v. People, 642 P.2d 490 (Colo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The policy considerations behind the enactment of this section
       
       prohibiting the driving of a vehicle in excess of the maximum speed of 55 miles per hour is that a driver must be charged as a matter of public policy, with the responsibility of ensuring that his vehicle is safe, so as to minimize the risk inherent in travel on our public highways.

      <p>
       <b>
        Speed limit is enforceable.
       </b>
       Since the penalty applicable to violation of the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit charged by complaint and summons is ascertainable, the speed limit is enforceable. Olinyk v. People, 642 P.2d 490 (Colo. 1982).

       Speed should be no greater than is reasonable and prudent.

       Crime irrespective of intent or scienter.
       
       Although the absence of a specified "culpable mental state" in this section is not conclusive on the issue, it is well settled that the general assembly may make a prohibited act a crime, irrespective of the elements of intent or scienter, when public policy so requires. People v. Caddy, 189

       Lack of culpable mental state no defense.
       
       Even though defendant presented evidence at trial that his speedometer reflected a speed 10 miles per hour below the true speed of his vehicle, and that he had no knowledge that the speedometer reading was in error, or that he should have known of the defective speedometer, his lack of a culpable mental state was not a defense to the charge of speeding.

       Since § 42-4-1105 is similar to § 42-4-1005 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42 as enacted by SB 94-1, a relevant case construing that provision has been included with the annotations to this section.

       This section is sufficiently definite to meet the constitutional requirements of due process of law.

      <p>
       Subsection (1) forbids
       
       intentional participation in operating motor vehicles competitively to test the swiftness of the vehicles involved. It further prohibits an individual's deliberate drawing of public attention to the vehicle's quality for swiftness. People v. Heckard, 164

      </p>
      <p>
       "Speed" and "acceleration" are related terms.
       
       The former refers to the act or state of moving swiftly, while "acceleration" means the act of increasing the speed. People v. Heckard, 164

      </p>
      <p>
       The speed or acceleration must occur under circumstances of a "contest" or "exhibition"
       
       on a highway. The terms employed in the instant statute give a clear and meaningful definition by virtue of their relation to each other. People v. Heckard, 164

      <p>
       "Contest" and "exhibition" imply.
       
       A "contest" ordinarily implies a plurality of participants in a deliberate, competitive act (here of speed or acceleration), while an "exhibition" implies a person's display, for the purpose of attracting public attention, of the same acts. People v. Heckard, 164

       In addition to any other liability provided for in this article, the owner of a motor vehicle who is engaged in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles is liable for payment of a parking violation fine unless the owner of the leased or rented motor vehicle can furnish sufficient evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, in the care, custody, or control of another person. To avoid liability for payment the owner of the motor vehicle is required, within a reasonable time after notification of the parking violation, to furnish to the prosecutorial division of the appropriate jurisdiction the name and address of the person or company who leased, rented, or otherwise had the care, custody, or control of such vehicle. As a condition to avoid liability for payment of a parking violation, any person or company who leases or rents motor vehicles to another person shall attach to the leasing or rental agreement a notice stating that, pursuant to the requirements of this section, the operator of the vehicle is liable for payment of a parking violation fine incurred when the operator has the care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle. The notice shall inform the operator that the operator's name and address shall be furnished to the prosecutorial division of the appropriate jurisdiction when a parking violation fine is incurred by the operator.

          (I) If at such time the defendant's BAC was 0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence of alcohol and that the defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle or vehicle was not impaired by the consumption of alcohol.
         </p>
         <p>
          (II) If at such time the defendant's BAC was in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, such fact gives rise to the permissible inference that the defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle or vehicle was impaired by the consumption of alcohol, and such fact may also be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether or not the defendant was under the influence of alcohol.

         The limitations of this subsection (6) shall not be construed as limiting the introduction, reception, or consideration of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or whether or not the defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle or vehicle was impaired by the consumption of alcohol.

The department of public health and environment may, by rule, determine that, because of the reliability of the results from certain devices, the collection or preservation of a second sample of a person's blood, saliva, or urine or the collection and preservation of a delayed breath alcohol specimen is not required.

        Since § 42-4-1301 is similar to § 42-4-1301 as it existed prior to its 2002 amendment and § 42-4-1202 as it existed prior to the 1994 amending of title 42 as enacted by SB 94-1, relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.

        Procedural due process violated when guilty plea to serious offense entered in summary proceeding.
        
        In view of the serious consequences which follow the entry of a plea of guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, the summary disposal immediately after arrest, notwithstanding the belief of the officer, evidenced by the fact that he filed the charge, that the accused was under the influence of liquor, constitutes a serious deprivation of the constitutional right of the accused to a fair trial. It is axiomatic that justice delayed is justice denied, but there are limits to the acceleration process, and the instant procedure was so unjustifiably sudden as to constitute a violation of the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process of law.

         A first-time charge of driving while ability impaired is not a petty offense.
        </b>
        The general assembly's placement of numerous alcohol and drug-related offenses in a single statute demonstrates an intention to not treat first-time driving while ability impaired offenses as petty offenses. The penalties are dependant upon circumstances that may not be known by the court at the time of arraignment. The penalties for a first-time offense may easily exceed those of a petty offense under § 16-10-109. Therefore, defendants are not required to file with a court under § 16-10-109 to obtain a trial by jury. Byrd v. Stavely, 113 P.3d 1273 (Colo. App. 2005).

         Subsection (2) authorizes only a permissive inference that defendant was under the influence of alcohol.
        </b>
        Because of the constitutional conflicts which arise with the use of presumptions in criminal cases and because of the central purposes behind the legislature's enactment of the presumption, subsection (2)(c) is properly construed to authorize only a permissive inference that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol. Barnes v. People, 735 P.2d 869 (Colo. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction which told jurors that they "must accept the presumption as if it had been factually established by the evidence" and that they could reject this presumption only if it was "rebutted by evidence to the contrary" created a mandatory and not a permissive presumption that the petitioner was under the influence of alcohol.

       <p>
        Subsection (2)(c) is very specific in limiting the use of its presumption to the misdemeanors

        Defendant's ability to attack validity of presumption

         Jury could infer that the defendant was under the influence at the time of the offense

        where the prosecution presented evidence that approximately three hours after the accident, defendant's blood alcohol level was above the statutory percentage. Because the circumstances at issue permitted the jury to make such inference, the extrapolation evidence offered to establish a still higher blood alcohol level was neither necessary nor relevant and the admission thereof was harmless error. People v. Emery, 812 P.2d 665 (Colo. App. 1990).

        Presumption that defendant was under influence specifically does not limit the introduction, reception, or consideration of other competent evidence

        Thus, moving pictures and their sound are admissible.
        
        Moving pictures and their sound, which are relevant and which allegedly show the demeanor and condition of a defendant charged with driving under the influence of either alcohol or drugs, taken at the time of the arrest or soon thereafter, are admissible in evidence even though they show the defendant's refusal to take sobriety and coordination tests, when properly offered in order to show the defendant's demeanor, conduct and appearance, and to show why sobriety and coordination tests were not given.

        The plain language of subsection (1) compels the conclusion that the general assembly intended prior DUI or DWAI offenses to constitute elements of felony DUI that do more than increase the penalty
        
        of the crime. Therefore, to obtain a conviction, a prosecutor must prove prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Transforming a misdemeanor into a felony does far more than simply increase the potential punishment; it changes the very nature of the offense because felony trials have important procedural distinctions and collateral consequences that misdemeanor cases do not.

        Prior convictions are a sentence enhancer,

        Subsection (4) only intended to increase punishment for substantive offense.
        
        The guilt of a substantive offense and the proof of prior convictions are clearly severable. Proof of prior convictions or the adjudication that the defendant is an habitual criminal do not involve substantive offenses, but merely provide for increased punishment of those whose prior convictions fall within the scope of these statutes. The important relation between the primary offenses and the prior convictions charged is, therefore, the sentence to be imposed, and the jury does not participate in that. Righi v. People, 145

        Former convictions must be in separate counts of the information,

        The federal constitution does not prohibit the states from requiring a driver to submit to chemical testing of his blood shortly after a valid arrest. People v. Gillett, 629 P.2d 613 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not violate constitutional standards because the statute does not expressly require an evidentiary hearing on the issue of any alleged refusal to submit to some form of test to determine the alcohol content of a driver's breath or blood. The statutory requirement of a specific averment by the arresting officer that the driver refused to submit to an appropriate chemical analysis test makes the issue of refusal a question of fact, permitting the driver to present evidence contrary to such an averment and requiring the hearing officer to make a finding on such a factual issue based on all of the evidence. DuPuis v. Charnes, 668 P.2d 1 (Colo. 1983).

        Under statute's plain language, a paramedic need not be supervised by a physician or nurse to withdraw blood.
        
        The statute describes five categories of individuals authorized to withdraw blood: physicians, nurses, paramedics, emergency medical service providers, and other persons "whose normal duties include withdrawing blood samples under the supervision of a physician or registered nurse". To apply the "under the supervision of a physician or registered nurse" requirement to any of the categories of individuals other than the last category would lead to an absurd result requiring physicians and nurses to be supervised.

       One may be said to be guilty of wanton behavior when,
       
       although the defendant may not have deliberately intended to injure anyone, he consciously chooses a dangerous course of action which to a reasonable mind creates a strong probability that injury to others will result. Martin v. People, 179

       Both reckless and careless driving offenses consist of two elements: (1) The act of driving a motor vehicle; and (2) the state of mind in "disregard" of or "without due regard" for safety. People v. Chapman, 192

      <p>
       In both reckless and careless driving statutes the essence of the mental element is disregard of safety in driving. In both it is the absence of care which renders the driving criminal. People v. Chapman, 192

        While the legislature has clearly not barred the holder of legal title from maintaining liability coverage,

       it has nevertheless compelled a conditional vendee with an immediate right of possession to provide the statutorily required coverage and subjected the vendee to personal liability and criminal sanctions for failing to do so. Sachtjen v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 49 P.3d 1146 (Colo. 2002).

        It is not the prosecution's burden to prove,
       </b>
       as an element of the offense, that an officer requested proof of insurance before an offender may be convicted under subsection (2). Rather, the prosecution's burden is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender was driving and that he or she had no insurance. People v. Martinez, 179 P.3d 23 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because subsection (6) enacts a safeguard to protect drivers who have insurance but who are unable to produce evidence of it when stopped by an officer, and since the defendant never asserted or suggested during trial that he had insurance, the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant was guilty under subsection (2).

       A defendant may be charged with multiple offenses of eluding a police officer arising from a single criminal episode

       defendant's four convictions for vehicular eluding do not merge with one another, and defendant's four convictions for eluding a police officer do not merge with one another because each officer was eluded during separate times at separate locations. People v. McMinn,

       is not exclusively a local matter. Infractions of these provisions are of general public concern. Moreover, these requirements do not necessarily relate to traffic control, but provide certain necessary actions on the part of the motorist involved to be taken after an accident occurs to protect the life and property of the injured. When these offenses are charged they come under the general police power of the state and do not necessarily relate to regulation of motor vehicle traffic of a "local or municipal" nature, although occurring in a municipality.

Nor may it be concerned about the extent of injuries to persons or damage to property resulting from an accident made the basis of such a prosecution. Those questions are referable to a prosecution under a different statute, or to a civil action for damages. It is not the accident, as such, therefore, that constitutes the offense. Weiderspon v.

       Every hearing in county court for the adjudication of a traffic infraction, as provided by this article, shall be held before a county court magistrate appointed pursuant to part 5 of article 6 of title 13, C.R.S., or before a county judge acting as a magistrate; except that, whenever a crime and a class A or class B traffic infraction or a crime and both such class A and class B traffic infractions are charged in the same summons and complaint, all charges shall be made returnable before a judge or magistrate having jurisdiction over the crime and the rules of criminal procedure shall apply. Nothing in this part 17 or in part 5 of article 6 of title 13, C.R.S., shall be construed to prevent a court having jurisdiction over a criminal charge relating to traffic law violations from lawfully entering a judgment on a case dealing with a class A or class B traffic infraction.

The district attorney or the district attorney's deputy may, in the district attorney's discretion, enter traffic infraction cases for the purpose of attempting a negotiated plea or a stipulation to deferred prosecution or deferred judgment and sentence but shall not be required to so enter by any person, court, or law, nor shall the district attorney represent the state at hearings conducted by a magistrate or a county judge acting as a magistrate on class A or class B traffic infraction matters. The magistrate or county judge acting as a magistrate shall be permitted to call and question any witness and shall also act as the fact finder at hearings on traffic infraction matters.

        Unless §§ 42-2-201 to 42-2-208 are implicated, evidence of a driver's prior traffic convictions is not admissible in a civil action,
       </b>
       even if such convictions caused the driver's license to be suspended at the time of the accident that is the subject of the civil action. Absent an adjudication by the department of revenue that the driver was an habitual offender, the convictions are inadmissible for any purpose, including to show that the prior convictions giving rise to the suspension indicated a habit, practice, and pattern of disregard for traffic regulations.

        Highly speculative assertion in personal injury action that plaintiff's decedent would have been convicted of driving under suspension had he survived, and thus qualify as an habitual offender under §§ 42-2-201 to 42-2-208, does not meet the exception in this section.
       </b>

       Section prohibits admission of evidence of charge of violation.
       
       By this section, the general assembly obviously intended, by prohibiting the admission in evidence in a civil action of the record of conviction of any person for violation of the traffic laws, to prohibit also the asking questions as to whether or not the plaintiff had been charged in justice's court with a violation of the state traffic laws. Ripple v. Brack, 132

      <p>
       No prejudice to defendant.
       
       The medical witness stated: "An auto hit him in the back and he got a ticket for reckless driving." The statement is ambiguous; for that reason it was proper to clarify since the plaintiff did not receive a ticket, and the defendant's counsel did not move to strike the statement. The facts do not bring the motion for mistrial within the ambit of the proscription of the statute, since the statement made no mention of a "conviction", nor was any effort made to introduce a "record of the conviction of any person". There was no prejudice to the defendant. Thompson v. Tartler, 166

       Since § 42-4-1812 is similar to § 42-4-1813 as it existed prior to the 2002 amendment to part 18 of article 4 of title 42, which resulted in the relocation of provisions, relevant cases decided under former provisions similar to that section have been included in the annotations to this section.

       Section not applicable to parties in collision of two automobiles.
       
       Where two automobiles were involved in a collision at an intersection, none of the parties to an action arising out of the collision are within the purview of this section; for the intent of the enactment was neither exclusively, nor in part, to protect any interest of either of them. Any violation of it did not constitute a breach of any statutory duty owed, either to the violator or to the other party. Its provisions, therefore, are not determinative of any action between them.

       Presence of school bus not determinative of negligence as matter of law.
       
       The presence of the school bus at the intersection was a factor the jury could properly consider when making its determinations on the questions of the negligence of the respective parties to this case, under ordinary negligence principles; but its presence, and the existence of the statute regulating it, was not determinative, as a matter of law, of the issue of negligence.

       Violation only makes one liable to person in class protected by section.
       
       A statute or ordinance may, because of its title, preamble, history or otherwise, be construed as intended to protect only the interests of a particular class of individuals. If so, a violation of the enactment can make the actor liable only to a person of that class. Hamilton v. Gravinsky, 28 Colo.

       The state board of education, by and with the advice of the executive director of the department, shall adopt and enforce regulations not inconsistent with this article to govern the operation of all school buses used for the transportation of schoolchildren and to govern the discharge of passengers from such school buses. Such regulations shall prohibit the driver of any school bus used for the transportation of schoolchildren from discharging any passenger from the school bus which will result in the passenger's immediately crossing a major thoroughfare, except for two-lane highways when such crossing can be done in a safe manner, as determined by the local school board in consultation with the local traffic regulatory authority, and shall prohibit the discharging or loading of passengers from the school bus onto the side of any major thoroughfare whenever access to the destination of the passenger is possible by the use of a road or street which is adjacent to the major thoroughfare. For the purposes of this section, a "major thoroughfare" means a freeway, any U.S. highway outside any incorporated limit, interstate highway, or highway with four or more lanes, or a highway or road with a median separating multiple lanes of traffic. Every person operating a school bus or responsible for or in control of the operation of school buses shall be subject to said regulations.

Such sale shall be made to a licensed motor vehicle dealer or wholesaler, or wholesale motor vehicle auction dealer, or through a classified newspaper advertisement published in Colorado. For purposes of this section, a sale shall not be considered commercially reasonable if the vehicle's appraisal value is more than three hundred fifty dollars and the vehicle is sold to an officer or partner of the operator that has possession of the vehicle or to any other person with a proprietary interest in such operator.

        A certificate of title shall be prima facie evidence of the matters contained therein; a certificate of registration is presumptive evidence of ownership of an automobile, but the presumption is rebuttable.

       A certificate of title does not represent conclusive proof of ownership. To overcome this presumption, a debtor must demonstrate that title alone does not determine ownership. Hill v. Koching, 338 B.R. 463 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2005); In re Smith, 535 B.R. 374 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2015).

       Issuance of the title certificate to a repossessor involves no deprivation of due process

       Regulation of possible abuse is legislative matter.
       
       It may be that repossession of automobiles or any other property sold on time payment with an express agreement permitting such repossession without notice may be resulting in great abuses, and controls are needed. If so, the regulation of this abuse is a matter for the general assembly, not the courts. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186

       Activity of the director of revenue in the issuance of a new title to a repossessor of a motor vehicle is strictly limited
       
       to the ministerial duty of providing prima facie evidence of what has already occurred by purely private action, namely, the transfer of title from the debtor to the creditor in a manner specifically provided for by their agreement. It does not in any meaningful way involve the director in the repossession and subsequent transfer of ownership to the repossessor. Sifuentes v. Weed, 186

       Purpose of this section
       
       is to insure that purchasers of automobiles, whether individual citizens or dealers, as well as lenders who finance automobile purchases, can readily and reliably ascertain the status of the seller's title to the automobile without recourse to other official state records.

       Intent of section.
       
       This section is intended to hold in abeyance both the seller's power to transfer and the purchaser's right to receive any right, title, or interest in the automobile to be sold until such time as the certificate of title is delivered to the purchaser.

      <p>
       The statutes are designed to provide a method whereby the licensing authorities may check and control the chain of title
       
       as it passes from one private purchaser to another, to the end that bogus or illegal transactions may more easily be detected. Codding v. Jackson, 132

       Showing of mortgages on title certificates.
       
       The mobility of motor vehicles and their frequent sale in states far distant from the county of the mortgage filing has resulted in a new method of protection by means of showing mortgages on the title certificate, which can be carried with the car, rather than by record in the files of a distant and probably unknown county. Under the policy of our law the requisite of clear title is the possession of a certificate free of lien. Title depends on receipt of such a certificate, and ignorance of mortgages must be proven by the certificate. First Nat'l Bank v. Chuck Lowen, Inc., 128

       , the recognition of a foreign mortgage in Colorado depends not upon its being filed for record, but upon its appearing on the certificate of title. That section must be construed together with this section which provides that except in cases not here applicable no person shall sell a motor vehicle without delivering a certificate of title and that no purchaser shall acquire any right, title, or interest in a motor vehicle unless he shall first obtain from the transferor the certificate of title thereto. By virtue of that section, on failure of an out-of-state dealer to deliver such certificate, whether because it showed a mortgage on its face or because it was deposited with the mortgagee, the purchaser could acquire no title as against prior mortgagees, and his rights are subordinate to such as are valid.

       Requirements for divestment of ownership and possession.
       
       Where a party executes a formal transfer of title by subscribing his name before a notary public at a bank, and then delivers the title and possession of the vehicle upon receipt of the funds, he completely divests himself of ownership of the vehicle and any right to possession thereof.

       An endorsement in blank of a certificate of title to a motor vehicle gives an immediate transferee the implied authority to insert his name as the purchaser,
       
       and its transferability is limited to the surrender thereof to the proper licensing authority for the purpose of issuing a new certificate to such transferee. Codding v. Jackson, 132

Under § 4-9-315, the bank was left with a security interest only in the proceeds of the sale. Therefore, a credit union that financed the purchase of the vehicle from the dealer had a security interest that prevails against the bank, even though the certificate of title was not conveyed to the credit union at the time of sale.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      After a mortgage on a motor or off-highway vehicle has been filed in the authorized agent's office, the authorized agent shall mail, deliver, or electronically transfer to the director the certificate of title or other evidence of ownership satisfactory to the director as specified in rules adopted under section 42-6-104 that the authorized agent has filed in the record. The director shall maintain completed electronic records transferred by the authorized agent. The director shall issue a new certificate of title containing, in addition to the other matters required to be set forth in certificates of title, a description of the mortgage and all information respecting the mortgage and the filing of the mortgage that appear in the certificate of the authorized agent, and the director or the director's authorized agent shall then dispose of the new certificate of title containing the notation as provided in section 42-6-124. When a motor or off-highway vehicle is subject to an electronic mortgage or lien, the certificate of title for the motor or off-highway vehicle is considered to be physically held by the mortgagee or lienholder for all legal purposes, including compliance with state or federal odometer disclosure requirements.

       On and after July 1, 1977, a person who takes a junior mortgage on a motor or off-highway vehicle for which a Colorado certificate of title has been issued or filed may file the mortgage for public record and have the existence of the mortgage noted or filed on the certificate of title with like effect as in other cases, as required by this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t42a06p01s42-6-129ol12">
       The junior mortgagee or the holder of the mortgage shall file the mortgage as required by section 42-6-121 with the authorized agent of the county where the mortgagor of the motor or off-highway vehicle resides or where the vehicle is located with a written request to have the existence of the mortgage noted or filed on the certificate of title records of the authorized agent pertaining to the vehicle covered by the junior mortgage. Upon the filing of the mortgage, the authorized agent shall note in the record of the vehicle the day and hour when the mortgage was received by the agent, shall make and deliver a receipt for the mortgage to the person filing the mortgage, and shall file the mortgage as required under section 42-6-122. If there is more than one mortgage or lien on the motor or off-highway vehicle, the department's authorized agent may electronically transmit the mortgage or lien to the first mortgage or lienholder and notify the first mortgage or lienholder of any additional mortgages or liens.

      <li id="t42a06p01s42-6-129ol13">
       The director's authorized agent, by registered mail, return receipt requested, shall make a written demand on the holder of the certificate of title, addressed to such person at the person's address as the same may appear in said written request, that such certificate be delivered to the authorized agent for the purpose of having noted on the certificate such second or junior mortgage. Within fifteen days after the receipt of such demand, the person holding such certificate shall either mail or deliver the same to such director's authorized agent or, if the person no longer has possession of the certificate, shall so notify the agent and, if the person knows, shall likewise inform the agent where and from whom such certificate may be procured. Upon the receipt of such certificate, the director's authorized agent shall complete an application for a new title and record the number thereof on the mortgage, as in the case of a first mortgage, and shall, as in the case of a first mortgage, issue and file a new certificate of title on which record the existence of all mortgages on the motor vehicle, including such second or junior mortgage, have been noted.

       If a person lawfully in possession of a certificate of title to a motor or off-highway vehicle, upon whom demand is made for the delivery to the authorized agent, fails to deliver or mail the certificate of title to the authorized agent, the person is liable to the holder of the junior mortgage for all damage sustained by reason of the omission.

If the certificate of title for the vehicle bears any notation adequate to apprise a purchaser, creditor, lienholder, or mortgagee of the existence of a mortgage or lien at the time a third party acquires a right in the motor vehicle, the mortgage or lien and the rights of the holder of the mortgage or lien are enforceable in this state as though the mortgage were filed in Colorado and noted on the certificate of title or noted in the record of the authorized agent for the vehicle under section 42-6-121.

       Purpose, application, and limitations of section.
       
       The purpose of this section, being to apprise a local purchaser of the existence of a foreign lien, it applies only to a regular and nonfraudulent foreign title, and its operation is limited to the protection of a local innocent purchaser where a foreign title is issued without notation of lien.

       Refusal to give effect to mortgage filed for record in foreign state.
       
       In the first sentence of this section the general assembly has changed the prior law by refusing to give effect to a mortgage that is filed for record in a foreign state and nothing more, at least in a state which uses the system of certificates of title. Federico v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 140

      </p>
      <p>
       Modified by second sentence of section.
       
       If taken literally, the first sentence of this section would indicate that no foreign mortgage shall be enforceable against a subsequent purchaser for value in Colorado. However, the second sentence of the same section refers to the "certificate of title for such vehicle ... under the laws of ... any other state". Thus, it would appear that the second sentence modifies and thus limits the first sentence to application to mortgages originating in certificate of title states. Doenges-Glass, Inc. v. GMAC, 175

       The general assembly is acutely aware of the toll in human suffering and loss of life, limb, and property caused by negligence in the operation of motor vehicles in our state. Although it recognizes that this basic problem can be and is being dealt with by direct measures designed to protect our people from the ravages of irresponsible drivers, the general assembly is also very much concerned with the financial loss visited upon innocent traffic accident victims by negligent motorists who are financially irresponsible. In prescribing the sanctions and requirements of this article, it is the policy of this state to induce and encourage all motorists to provide for their financial responsibility for the protection of others, and to assure the widespread availability to the insuring public of insurance protection against financial loss caused by negligent financially irresponsible motorists.
      </li>
      <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12">
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12a">
         The general assembly hereby finds that motor vehicle accidents cause a substantial economic impact in lost wages, medical bills, and property destruction exacerbated by the following:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12aI">
           Some negligent motorists are uninsured or flee the scene of an accident.
          </li>
          <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12aII">
           Negligent motorists often attempt to avoid financial responsibility by means such as fleeing the state, concealing their whereabouts, or failing to update the address on their driver's license with the department of revenue, thereby frustrating service of process and preventing the innocent victim from accessing either the negligent driver's liability insurance policy or the uninsured motorist coverage the victim has purchased.
          </li>
          <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12aIII">
           When innocent traffic accident victims cannot access either the negligent driver's automobile liability policy or their own uninsured motorist coverage, the burden of the uncompensated losses are borne by the taxpayer in the form of taxes for medicaid, by trauma facilities in the form of uncompensated hospital-related costs, and by the innocent victim.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12b">
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12bI">
           The state of Colorado encourages the widespread availability of uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance by requiring every motor vehicle liability policy delivered or issued in this state to contain uninsured motorist coverage unless the named insured rejects such coverage in writing.
          </li>
          <li id="t42a07p01s42-7-102ol12bII">
           Because insurance benefits have been paid for by either the negligent driver or the innocent victim for the purpose of compensating the innocent victim for injuries or losses, the general assembly declares that it is necessary to simplify the process for an innocent victim to access the negligent driver's liability insurance policy or his or her own uninsured motorist coverage in order to prevent the burden from being borne by the taxpayer or the health care system.

       Before a person against whom an order of denial has been entered is entitled to operate a motor vehicle, he must reapply for a new license at the end of the period of denial, pay the restoration fee required by § 42-2-124 (3), file proof of financial responsibility as required by subsection (1) of this section, and must be in receipt and possession of the new license.

No fraud, misrepresentation, or other act of the insured in obtaining or retaining any such policy, or in adjusting a claim under any such policy, and no failure of the insured to give any notice, forward any paper, or otherwise cooperate with the insurance carrier shall constitute a defense as against the judgment creditor on any such judgment.

Unless the contract or policy of insurance provides for a shorter period of notice, said notice shall be so delivered or mailed to the address shown in the policy not less than thirty days prior to the date of cancellation.

       Purpose and provisions of section.
       
       The purpose of this section is to foster and promote insurance coverage or, in the event of accident, a bond to insure financial responsibility. Its ultimate object is to provide compensation for innocent persons who might be injured through faulty operation of motor vehicles. Toward these ends, it provides inter alia that: (1) The insurance carrier's liability shall become absolute whenever loss or damage covered by the policy occurs; (2) that attempted satisfaction of final judgment by insured shall not be a condition precedent to the obligation of carrier to make payment; (3) that fraud, misrepresentation or other act of insured in obtaining the policy shall not constitute a defense available to the insurer against a judgment creditor; and (4) limitations upon the cancellation of a policy.

       In an action by judgment creditors of the insured against the insurer on an automobile liability policy, where the policy sued upon was not issued in consequence of the insured's previous accident record under the provisions of this section, but was issued by the insurer upon the false representations of the insured with respect to his previous record, this section has no application and it is error to direct a verdict for plaintiffs.

        Annotator's note.
       </b>
       Since this section is similar to repealed CSA, C. 16, § 48(1), a relevant case construing CSA, C. 16, § 48(1), has been included in the annotations to this section.

      <p>
       The reason for this section
       
       obviously is for the protection of persons within the border who may have reason to enforce liability upon the person so entering the state and using the highways thereof. Such a provision is not necessary, and does not apply to a person entering the state for the purpose of residing here in connection with an employment within the state, as obtains from the facts herein disclosed. For all purposes here material, the person so situated and residing within the state is in the same class as lifelong residents, and if such person is involved in an accident in this state and leaves the state shortly thereafter, it is immaterial.

      <p>
       Nonresident subject to act and secretary of state is his attorney for service of process.
       
       The provisions of this section were intended to, and do, clearly indicate that whenever a resident of some other state crosses the border line into this state, whether on a drive across the country, or for a short sojourn, he has subjected himself to the provisions of the statute, and by such entry made the secretary of state his true and lawful attorney upon whom service may be had if the person is involved in any accident or collision upon the public highway while operating a motor vehicle thereon. If the time involved is only one hour or less in crossing a corner of the state, or into and out thereof, such appointment is in full force and effect. Warwick v. District Court, 129

      <p>
       The general assembly hereby finds and determines that the operation of a motor vehicle in commerce has important statewide ramifications for commercial diesel vehicle operators because the transportation of people and property is not confined to one jurisdiction. Therefore, the general assembly hereby declares that idling standards are a matter of statewide concern.

     <p>
      It is hereby determined and declared that nuclear materials create a potential risk to the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state of Colorado. As an origination point of nuclear waste and a corridor state through which nuclear materials pass, the state has a duty to protect its citizens and environment from all hazards created by the transportation of nuclear materials within its borders. State and public participation in planning for the transport of nuclear materials and in the development of a plan to cope with all phases of the nuclear materials problem is essential in order to adequately prepare for potential nuclear incidents. To that end, it is the purpose of this part 4 and part 5 of this article to require safe and environmentally acceptable methods of transporting nuclear materials within this state in a manner consistent with the laws of the United States and the rules and regulations promulgated by agencies of the United States.

        Any person who commits any of the acts enumerated in subsection (3) of this section is subject to the civil penalty listed in said subsection (3). Officers of the Colorado state patrol have the authority to issue civil penalty assessments for the enumerated violations. At any time that a person is cited for a violation enumerated in subsection (3) of this section, the person in charge of or operating the motor vehicle involved shall be given a notice in the form of a civil penalty assessment notice. The notice shall be tendered by the officer of the Colorado state patrol and must contain the name and address of the person, the license number of the motor vehicle involved, if any, the number of the person's driver's license, the nature of the violation, the amount of the penalty prescribed for the violation, the date of the notice, a place for the person to execute a signed acknowledgment of his or her receipt of the civil penalty assessment notice, a place for the person to execute a signed acknowledgment of liability for the cited violation, and such other information as may be required by law to constitute the notice as a complaint to appear in court should the prescribed penalty not be paid within ten days. Every cited person shall execute the signed acknowledgment of his or her receipt of the civil penalty assessment notice. The acknowledgment of liability shall be executed at the time the cited person pays the prescribed penalty. The person cited shall pay the civil penalty specified in subsection (3) of this section for the violation involved at the office of the department of revenue either in person or by postmarking such payment within ten days of the citation. The department of revenue shall accept late payment of any penalty assessment up to twenty days after the payment becomes due. If the person cited does not pay the prescribed penalty within ten days of the notice, the civil penalty assessment notice shall constitute a complaint to appear in court unless payment for the penalty assessment has been accepted by the department of revenue as evidenced by receipt, and the person cited shall, within the time specified in the civil penalty assessment notice, file an answer to this complaint with the county court for the county in which the penalty assessment was issued. The attorney general shall represent the Colorado state patrol if so requested by the Colorado state patrol.
