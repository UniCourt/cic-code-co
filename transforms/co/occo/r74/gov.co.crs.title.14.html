        </b>
        Since § 14-1-101 is similar to repealed § 4-1-13, CRS 53, a relevant case construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary purpose of this section is expressed in the first sentence:
        
        "Any person desiring to adopt a person over 21 years of age as heir-at-law ....". Martin v. Cuellar, 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 117
        </cite>
        , 279 P.2d 843 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The name of the person adopted under this section
        
        need not be changed. Martin v. Cuellar, 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 117
        </cite>
        , 279 P.2d 843 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        No obligation whatsoever is placed upon the person adopted with respect to the adoptive parent,
        
        and he is granted no rights whatever, other than the acquisition of an heir-at-law, who may or may not even bear his name. Martin v. Cuellar, 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 117
        </cite>
        , 279 P.2d 843 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is merely a means of giving effect to a personal transaction
        
        mutually agreeable between two adults. Martin v. Cuellar, 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 117
        </cite>
        , 279 P.2d 843 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        No rights of the natural parents of the person adopted are taken from them,
        
        or even mentioned, where the purpose of the adoption is to acquire an adult "heir-at-law". Martin v. Cuellar, 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 117
        </cite>
        , 279 P.2d 843 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Certainly the rights of the natural parents of such person so adopted
        
        may not be lost in a proceeding of which they receive no notice, and there is no requirement of service of notice upon them. Martin v. Cuellar, 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 117
        </cite>
        , 279 P.2d 843 (1955).

         The effect of an adult adoption and a child adoption are different.
        </b>
        A person adopts an adult to make such person his or her intestate heir. Matter of Trust created by Belgard, 829 P.2d 457 (Colo. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         This section requires the trial court to grant an adult adoption
        </b>
        when there is valid service and the adoptee consents to such adoption. There is no additional requirement that there be a minimum age differential between the adoptor and the adoptee nor is adoption precluded based upon the prior relationship of the parties. In re P.A.L. von R., 5 P.3d 390 (Colo. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         It does not violate public policy of state to permit a person to adopt his or her own adult sibling.
        </b>
        In re P.A.L. von R., 5 P.3d 390 (Colo. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one over the age of 21 years is adopted as an heir-at-law by another person,
        
        such adoptive parent is without legal status to maintain action under the wrongful death statute for the death of such adopted person. Martin v. Cuellar, 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 117
        </cite>
        , 279 P.2d 843 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Considering the circumstances at the time the trust was executed and the settlor's reasonable expectations,
        </b>
        the phrase "persons legally adopted" was held to include adopted children only, not adults. The court held that the respondent was using the adult adoption statute to entitle his wife to a remainder of the trust estate, contrary to the settlor's intent as set forth in the instrument. Matter of Trust created by Belgard, 829 P.2d 457 (Colo. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The general assembly's desire to place adopted and natural children on par with one another does not extend
        </b>
        to permit adult adoptions for the purpose of giving them an interest in property already specifically designated. Such an adoption decree did not have the power to affect the disposition of such interests, it only granted the right to inherit through intestacy. Matter of Trust created by Belgard, 829 P.2d 457 (Colo. App. 1991).
       </p>

        Section 19-4-104 (1) (now § 19-5-215), relating to confidentiality of records, applies to adult adoption proceedings under this section. In re W.D.A. v. City &amp; County of Denver, 632 P.2d 582 (Colo. 1981).

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who has cohabited with another to whom he or she is not legally married in the good faith belief that he or she was married to that person is a putative spouse until knowledge of the fact that he or she is not legally married terminates his or her status and prevents acquisition of further rights. A putative spouse acquires the rights conferred upon a legal spouse, including the right to maintenance following termination of his or her status, whether or not the marriage is prohibited under section 14-2-110, declared invalid, or otherwise terminated by court action. If there is a legal spouse or other putative spouses, rights acquired by a putative spouse do not supersede the rights of the legal spouse or those acquired by other putative spouses, but the court shall apportion property, maintenance, and support rights among the claimants as appropriate in the circumstances and in the interests of justice.

       </b>
       in matters apart from the domestic duties of the wife pertaining strictly to the household and the family, may be entered into by the wife as if she were sole, and for this reason such contract cannot be held to be against public policy. Tuttle v. Shutts, 43 Colo. 534, 96 P. 260 (1908).

        Contracts between a husband and his wife are not presumptively void.

      <p>
       <b>
        Since some contracts between parties in fiduciary relations to each other are valid, and some are voidable or void,
       </b>
       and some contracts between strangers are valid, and some are void, no definite conclusion can be drawn as to the validity or invalidity of a contract from the fact that the parties to it occupied a fiduciary relation to each other. Daniels v. Benedict, 97 F. 367 (8th Cir. 1899).

        A promissory note given by a married woman and her husband, for property purchased by her as a sole trader, is valid in law,

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Since under this section the rights of the wife to manage and control her individual property are well established,
       </b>
       the relation of debtor and creditor may exist between husband and wife as fully as if both were sole, and the wife may deal with the husband as with a stranger, and in case of the insolvency of the husband, he may pay the wife to the exclusion of other creditors, but the existence of the individual property and the bona fides of the debt must, as in other cases, be fully established. Knapp v. Day, 4 Colo. App. 21, 34 P. 1008 (1893).

      <p>
       <b>
        Under this section a husband is deprived of all interest in the labor of his wife rendered to third persons,

       <b>
        It may be contended that the words "on her sole and separate account", in the first clause of this section
       </b>
       restrict the woman's right to cases in which she declares her intention to appropriate the proceeds of her labor to her own use. But there is little room for such construction, because it must be presumed that every one who labors for hire is seeking his own personal emolument, for men do not sow that others may reap, and the highest claim to the fruits of labor is vested in him who performs it, and none other need be asserted. Allen v. Eldridge, 1 Colo. 287 (1871).

       While it was true that because of the married women's acts, married women could successfully maintain actions for interference with their rights to consortium
       
       which arose from intentional, malicious, or direct action by an outsider, nevertheless, the prevailing opinion and great weight of authority denied such an action to a married woman for indirect, remote, or consequential loss, and thus, a married woman had no right to recover for the loss of consortium alone occasioned by the negligent acts of third persons.

       (2)(d) does not require a "valid agreement" to be in writing, in harmonizing the statutes, subsection (1) of this section must be given effect.

       Home excluded from marital property where husband conveyed the home to wife as her separate property through an interspousal transfer deed with the intent to make it her separate property.
       
       Although not a marital agreement under this act, because it was not signed by both parties, transfer was upheld because husband conveyed the property to wife as her sole property, admitting that this was his intent and that he was familiar with the concept of separate property. A conveyance is different from an agreement to convey. Therefore, the interspousal transfer deed did not have to meet the requirements and formalities of this act. In re Blaine,

        Annotator's note.
       </b>
       Since § 14-2-309 is similar to § 14-2-307 as it existed prior to the 2013 repeal and reenactment of this part 3, relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations for this section. For cases dealing with the validity of marital agreements prior to 1986, see the annotations to §§ 14-10-112 and 14-10-113.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A trial court must find that the maintenance provisions of an otherwise valid antenuptial agreement are unconscionable
       </b>
       at the time a divorce decree is entered in order to award maintenance to a party. In re Dechant, 867 P.2d 193 (Colo. App. 1993) (decided under law in effect prior to amendment effective July 1, 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining unconscionability, the terms "appropriate employment" and "reasonable needs" are not to be interpreted so narrowly as to require a spouse to establish that he or she lacks the minimum resources to sustain life. In re Dechant, 867 P.2d 193 (Colo. App. 1993) (decided under law in effect prior to amendment effective July 1, 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trial court may review a waiver of attorney fees in a marital agreement for unconscionability at the time of dissolution,
       </b>
       because an unconscionable waiver violates the public policy interest behind protecting spouses and thus is not a valid contract term under § 14-2-304. In re Ikeler, 161 P.3d 663 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Standards for determining unconscionability.
       </b>
       Generally, an agreement under this section is unconscionable if it is not fair, reasonable, and just. In re Christen, 899 P.2d 339 (Colo. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Speculation about possible future events, such as unemployment, disability, and remarriage, do not indicate that the agreement is at present unconscionable. In re Christen, 899 P.2d 339 (Colo. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the parties enter into an agreement that provides for maintenance to be paid year-to-year in an amount calculated in accordance with a formula agreed upon by the parties and accepted as not unconscionable by the court, the trial court acts within its discretion in not setting forth an exact amount of maintenance in its decree of dissolution and permanent orders. In re Christen, 899 P.2d 339 (Colo. App. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In order for agreement for binding Rabbinical arbitration to be enforceable,
       </b>
       it must be conscionable and must be entered into by the parties voluntarily after full disclosure. In re Popack, 998 P.2d 464 (Colo. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Waiver of attorney fee provision
       </b>
       in an antenuptial agreement is voidable on the grounds of unconscionability. In re Dechant, 867 P.2d 193 (Colo. App. 1993) (decided under law in effect prior to amendment effective July 1, 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Marital agreement need not be approved by the court nor a complete agreement
       </b>
       as to the disposition of all of the parties' property to be enforceable. In re Goldin, 923 P.2d 376 (Colo. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But marital agreement must contain a fair and reasonable disclosure of property and financial obligations of the party seeking to enforce it,
       </b>
       and prenuptial agreement that was blank at the time wife signed it was unenforceable by husband. In re Seewald, 22 P.3d 580 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Agreement entered into just prior to marriage and a subsequent agreement entered into just prior to filing petition for dissolution
       </b>
       were correctly considered not to be enforceable agreements under the Colorado Marital Agreement Act. Trial court correctly determined that the premarital agreement was not an enforceable premarital agreement because the parties were not contemplating marriage when they entered into it. Similarly, the later agreement was not an enforceable marital agreement because it was signed after wife petitioned for dissolution of marriage and because the parties were not on an equal emotional or economic footing. In re Green, 169 P.3d 202 (Colo. App. 2007).

        There is hereby established in the state treasury the family violence justice fund, hereafter referred to as the "fund". Pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the state court administrator is authorized to make grants from the fund directly to qualifying organizations providing civil legal services to indigent residents of the state of Colorado.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a04s14-4-107ol12">
        Grants from the fund shall be used to fund qualifying organizations to provide legal advice, representation, and advocacy for and on behalf of indigent clients who are victims of family violence. Moneys from the fund may be provided for services that include, but are not limited to:
        <ol type="a">
         <li id="t14a04s14-4-107ol12a">
          The provision of direct legal representation to victims of family violence in resolving their civil legal matters and removing impediments to the elimination of family violence. Such representation may include, but need not be limited to, representation in any protection order proceeding; action for dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or declaration of invalidity of marriage; action for dissolution of a civil union, legal separation, or declaration of invalidity of a civil union; paternity action; child custody action; proceeding to establish or enforce child support; administrative hearings; or any other judicial actions in which family violence is an issue or in which legal representation is necessary to protect the interests of a victim of family violence.

         <li id="t14a04s14-4-107ol12b">

        A qualifying organization seeking to receive a grant from the fund shall submit an application each year to the state court administrator on a form provided by such administrator. The application form shall request any information which the administrator may need in determining the qualifications of the organization for receipt of a grant. Commencing July 1, 1999, and quarterly thereafter, the state court administrator shall distribute grants from the fund, subject to available appropriations, to a qualifying organization for each county or city and county based upon the following formula:
        <ol type="a">
         <li id="t14a04s14-4-107ol13a">

          If there is more than one qualifying organization within a county or city and county, the proportionate share of the fund for such county or city and county disbursed to each such qualifying organization shall be allocated in proportion to the number of indigent family violence clients served by each qualifying organization or its predecessor in the preceding year.

          The moneys in the fund shall be subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly for the direct and indirect costs associated with the administration of this section. The state court administrator of the judicial department, subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly, is authorized to expend moneys appropriated to the department from the fund to qualifying organizations for the purposes described in this section; except that the amount expended for indirect costs associated with the administration of this section shall not exceed three percent of the moneys appropriated to the fund in any fiscal year. All investment earnings derived from the deposit and investment of the moneys in the fund shall be credited to the fund.

     </ol>
     <p>
      In 1950 the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), now more commonly referred to as the Uniform Law Commission (ULC), began a series of uniform acts dealing with cases involving establishment, enforcement, and modification of orders for "any duty of support" across state lines. This evolving process started with a revolutionary idea entitled the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), promulgated in 1950, and amended in 1952 and 1958. Further amendments in 1968 were so significant that the act was renamed the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (RURESA). Ultimately, all the states enacted one or more versions of the reciprocal support enforcement acts. A comprehensive history of the creation process from 1950 through 1968 is provided by William J. Brockelbank &amp; Felix Infausto, Interstate Enforcement of Family Support (Bobbs-Merrill Co., 2d ed. 1971). As with most revolutions, without it subsequent development would not have been possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      By 1988, however, problems had arisen regarding the application of RURESA in practice. After four iterations that lasted over four decades, revisiting the subject was deemed necessary. A drafting committee began to prepare amendments for RURESA, but the task proved more formidable than expected. The result was the promulgation of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, UIFSA (1992), which was designed to serve as a complete replacement for URESA and RURESA. In 1993 Arkansas and Texas were the first to enact the new act, and within three years thirty-five states had adopted it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The year 1996 was an eventful one for UIFSA. First, a drafting committee was convened in spring 1996 in response to requests from representatives of employer groups for specific statutory directions regarding interstate child-support income withholding orders. Second, the child-support community (especially the state programs funded under title IV-D of the Social Security Act) requested a substantive and procedural review. As a result, the NCCUSL at its annual conference in July adopted significant amendments and promulgated UIFSA (1996). Less than one month later, the U.S. Congress assured that nationwide acceptance of the amended Act was virtually certain. In the "welfare reform" legislation passed in August 1996, officially known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), the enactment of UIFSA, as amended, was mandated as a condition of state eligibility for the federal funding of child support enforcement and even under exigent circumstances to continued receipt of subsidies for TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Sec. 321. Adoption of Uniform State Laws (42 U.S.C. § 666) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
     </p>
     <p>
      (f) Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. In order to satisfy (42 U.S.C. § 654(20)(A)), on and after January 1, 1998, each state must have in effect the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, as approved by the American Bar Association on February 9, 1993, together with any amendments officially adopted before January 1, 1998, by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), Pub. L. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105 (1996), as amended by the Welfare Reform Technical Corrections Act of 1997.
     </p>
     <p>
      In accordance with this "federal mandate," all states enacted UIFSA (1996).
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2000 the child-support community again requested that the act be reviewed and amended as appropriate in the light of the years of experience with the 1992 and 1996 versions. Further, beginning in 1993 there had been an extraordinary amount of comprehensive training on the act by the child-support enforcement agencies throughout the nation and associated agencies and organizations of those agencies, e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE); National Child Support Enforcement Association (NCSEA); Eastern Regional Interstate Child Support Association (ERICSA); and Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement Council (WICSEC). A significant consequence of this attention was that the provisions of UIFSA were far more familiar to those who administered it than ever was true of its predecessor acts, URESA and RURESA.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drafting committee meeting in 2001 led to several substantive and procedural amendments, which clarified and extended the act without making any fundamental change in the earlier policies and procedures. The widespread acceptance of UIFSA has been due primarily to the fact that representatives of the child support enforcement community mentioned above participated actively in the drafting of every version of the act, including UIFSA (2008).
     </p>
     <p>
      When Congress mandated that UIFSA (1996) must be in place in all states by 1998, most interested parties viewed that action as an unalloyed benefit for the promulgation of the uniform act. Although all states promptly adopted UIFSA (1996), in retrospect, the federal action became a mixed blessing when it partially froze further development of the act. Through the development of consecutively promulgated versions of the act,
      <i>
       i.e.
      </i>
      , UIFSA (2001) and UIFSA (2008), UIFSA (1996) was withdrawn by NCCUSL as being no longer appropriate for enactment. The federal mandate, however, remains and as of January 1, 2015, UIFSA (1996) was in force in twenty five (25) states. The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) routinely granted waivers to any state requesting authority to enact UIFSA (2001), or, with a deferred effective date, UIFSA (2008). Using the waiver authority, as of January 1, 2015, seventeen states had enacted UIFSA (2001), and twelve states had approved UIFSA (2008), contingent upon the United States' ratification of the 2007 Convention. The current expectation is that all states, or at least a substantial majority of the remaining states will enact this version, UIFSA (2008), by the end of 2015.

      In sum, the original act, UIFSA (1992), was followed by two sets of amendments in 1996, and 2001.

This version is the third set of significant amendments to the act, referred to in these comments as UIFSA (2008).

       A. URESA and RURESA; Minimal Attention to International Orders
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      URESA (1950, 1952, and 1958) did not take into account enforcement of child-support or spousal-support orders that involved a foreign country. "State" was defined as one of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. The 1958 amendments to URESA expanded the definition to "any state, territory or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia in which this or a substantially reciprocal law has been enacted."
     </p>
     <p>
      RURESA (1968) made a significant change to the complete absence of attention to international support orders by expanding the definition of "state" to "any foreign jurisdiction in which this or substantially similar reciprocal law is in effect." Contemporaneous commentary indicated that the beneficiary of this amendment would be Canada, or at least certain Canadian provinces. The thought was expressed that the United States Department of State might negotiate a treaty with Canada, or that under a redefinition of the term "state" several Canadian provinces would be included as jurisdictions that would reciprocally enforce U.S. support orders.

       B. UIFSA (1992) (1996); Minor Changes in Treatment of International Orders
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The basic approach of UIFSA (1992) was to maintain the RURESA provision quoted above with the following minor modification: "State . . . includes a foreign jurisdiction that has established procedures for issuance and enforcement of support orders which are substantially similar to the procedures under this [Act]." UIFSA (1996) continued the basic provisions by adding that the foreign jurisdiction might have enacted a law that was also "substantially similar" to URESA or RURESA. Further, an amendment to Section 304 recognized that courts in Canadian provinces entered provisional orders for support to accompany their outgoing requests for establishment and enforcement, and required a provisional order from a state of the United States in order to establish a support order in Canada.
     </p>

      <b>
       C. UIFSA (2001); Bilateral Agreements Recognized
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In August 1996 PRWORA was enacted just three weeks after the promulgation of UIFSA (1996), which continued the approach of RURESA and UIFSA (1992), i.e., define "state" as including a foreign country with a "substantially similar" law to UIFSA. Indeed, this approach remains the law on the statute books of those U.S. jurisdictions that continue UIFSA (1996) in effect. UIFSA (2001) deleted the reference to a foreign country having a "substantially similar law" to URESA or RURESA. Although the revised act did specifically recognize the existence of bilateral agreements between the United States and foreign countries or their political subdivisions, UIFSA (2008) is specifically designed to accommodate U.S. domestic law to international family support orders, especially those resulting under the new Hague Convention of November 23, 2007.
     </p>
     <p>
      In short, the attention paid in the uniform support acts to issues involving foreign support orders initially was relatively limited until the advent of UIFSA (2001). Previously, in 1996 PRWORA tied the significant federal subsidy for child-support enforcement to the universal enactment of UIFSA (1996), and also laid the groundwork for greatly increased federal activity for reaching bilateral agreements on child support enforcement with foreign countries. The federal act authorized the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to enter into international agreements with foreign reciprocating countries with support enforcement procedures substantially in conformity with such procedures in the United States. Individual U.S. states were also encouraged to enter into reciprocal arrangements with the foreign jurisdictions with which they had the greatest number of international cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response, the U.S. State Department formed teams of negotiators to provide for bilateral agreements with a variety of foreign countries. Between 1998 and 2008, the United States entered into bilateral agreements with thirteen nations and eleven Canadian provinces (the federal government in Canada lacks jurisdiction over child-support orders).

     </p>
     <p>
      To accommodate the new world of bilateral orders on the federal level, UIFSA (2001) redefined "state" to encompass foreign countries with bilateral agreements with the United States. Despite repeated requests to Congress to mandate adoption of that version in order to facilitate increased international activity in child-support enforcement, no congressional action was taken through the end of 2008;

      Section 102(26),
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      , for the text of UIFSA (2001) and the entirely new approach in UIFSA (2008).
     </p>
     <p>
      As of June 1, 2003, there were several child support enforcement agreements among countries. One widely accepted agreement, which is largely hortatory and without practical effect, was sponsored by the United Nations in 1956 and referred to as the New York Convention. In addition, there are four agreements promulgated by The Hague Conference on Private International Law (HccH), two covering enforcement of child-support orders in 1958 and maintenance orders in 1973, and two dealing with applicable law in 1956 and 1973 (a civil law concept). These conventions operate primarily between European nations, and came to be viewed by HccH as out-of-date and relatively ineffective. In addition, there are a welter of regional agreements regarding enforcement of family maintenance orders. The United States is not a party to any of these multilateral agreements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beginning in June 2003, and continuing through November 2007, more than 70 countries met in The Hague, Netherlands, in five separate negotiating sessions to forge a new Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The United States delegation, headed by the U.S. State Department and including members from OCSE and other experts, was a crucial participant throughout the term of negotiations. It was clearly a goal of all the parties engaging in the negotiations that the United States be an active party and ultimately adopt the Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a first step, the Convention was signed by the United States at The Hague, Netherlands, on November 23, 2007. In context, this initial signature represents a commitment by the executive branch of the federal government to make a good faith effort to bring the Convention into force. The Senate has given its advice and consent to the Convention. When it is signed by the President, and the appropriate documents are filed in The Hague, the federal preemption of the issue via the treaty clause will be sufficient to make the Convention "the law of the land."
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      U.S. Const. art. VI. cl. 2. However, because this multilateral treaty is not self-executing, additional federal or state statutory enactments are necessary to enable the treaty and make it readily accessible to bench and bar. Because establishment, enforcement, and modification of family support are basically matters of state law, from the perspective of the Uniform Law Commission the vehicle for the acceptance into force of the new Convention is a revision of UIFSA (2001), hereafter called UIFSA (2008). In time, it is anticipated the new Hague Maintenance Convention will achieve a high level of integration with many other countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       III. Drafting Principles for UIFSA (2008)
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The basic principles underlying the drafting of UIFSA (2008) anticipated a strictly limited revision of the act in order to integrate the appropriate provisions of the new Convention into state law. Because UIFSA (2001) had such a wide influence on the text of the new Convention, in very many instances the principles, and sometimes almost the exact text, of the Convention were already contained in UIFSA (2001). The clear drafting goal was to integrate the Convention into state law, and not to revise UIFSA (2001) in a substantive manner. Most frequently the amendment to the existing text was merely to add "or a foreign country" to the directives about how a "tribunal of this state" should deal with an order or another action of a "state." Correspondingly, the definition of "state" no longer contains the legal fiction that a foreign country is a state of the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, a significant portion of the language of the Convention need not be included in state law because that text speaks to the "Contracting States," that is, to the countries in which the Convention will come into force. A substantial percentage of the articles in the Convention are directed to the agreement between nation states or their political subdivisions, which do not implicate state tribunals. A majority of the provisions, however, do speak to the "competent authorities," which means to those tribunals charged with the obligation of applying the Convention to actual support orders. In sum, with relatively minimal amendments, the text of UIFSA (2008) combines the principles of UIFSA and the Convention with the required actions of a state tribunal to put the Convention into effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are some instances in which the text of UIFSA (2008) and the Convention differ in a manner that cannot be reconciled by fiat. On these occasions it is necessary to accommodate the Convention language to state law in order to avoid conflict between the Convention and the uniform state law. A choice had to be made; either substantially amend the text of UIFSA (2001), or create an independent set of rules to accommodate the differences between UIFSA and the Convention. The latter was the preferred decision. An all-new Article 7 constitutes a stand-alone portion of the act designed to direct a "tribunal of this state" on limited special practices and handling deemed to be necessary for establishing or enforcing a Convention support order. This decision was based on the conclusion that a limited number of specialized rules for Convention orders would result in a simpler, smoother transition than attempting to integrate new rules into the millions of existing child- support orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      UIFSA (2008) also may supply answers to some of the questions that the Convention leaves unresolved. This is particularly apt with regard to modification of existing orders when parties have moved from the issuing state or foreign country, or other factual circumstances have changed significantly. Regarding modification of orders, the Convention has only limited application, while UIFSA makes modification the subject of significant statutory effect.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      §§ 609-16.
     </p>
     <p>
      In sum, UIFSA (2008) constitutes a limited, rather than comprehensive, revision of the act. It is designed to integrate the Convention into state law, and not to amend UIFSA (2001) in any significant manner. The drafting principles are relatively simple:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14a05ol2D1">
       integrate the requirements of the Convention into the current text of UIFSA articles 1 through 6 by adding "or a foreign country" when the desired actions and goals of both acts are congruent;
      </li>
      <li id="t14a05ol2D2">
       adapt the language of the Convention to the current text of UIFSA articles 1 through 6 in order to make that language more comprehensible to the American bench and bar;
      </li>
      <li id="t14a05ol2D3">
       draft a stand-alone article in UIFSA to direct a "tribunal of this state" on do's and don'ts unique to the Convention support orders containing issues only applicable under the Convention; and,
      </li>
      <li id="t14a05ol2D4">
       omit the Convention text that need not be included in state law because it speaks only to "Contracting States," i.e., the United States and the other Convention countries.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The function of the comments to the act is not to serve as an annotated version of UIFSA (2008), but rather to provide the history and process involved in the drafting of the four iterations of a uniform act, one of which is in force in every jurisdiction of the United States. Other than key constitutional cases, most of the citations found in previous comments to earlier iterations of the act have been omitted.

       IV. Federal Action Implicating UIFSA (2008)

     <p>
      The usual course for treaties entered into by the United States pursuant to the treaty power, U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and which are not "self-executing," is for the treaty to be implemented through federal legislation. The states are, of course, required to comply with the treaty and the federal legislation, but, as noted above, the establishment, enforcement, and modification of family support orders are basically matters of state law. As UIFSA is the familiar and widely used tool for support determinations in cross-border situations, the Uniform Law Commission (ULC), in close consultation with the Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), incorporated applicable provisions of the Hague Maintenance Convention of November 23, 2007 into state law through amendments to UIFSA, now UIFSA (2008). In fact, the United States' negotiations team at The Hague included ULC representatives, and the 2007 treaty, in many important respects, parallels the UIFSA model of inter- jurisdictional cooperation.
     </p>
     <p>
      While it includes specific new features for international case processing, UIFSA (2008) incorporates substantial provisions of state law which will already be familiar to attorneys, courts, support enforcement agencies, and litigants. Congress, which funds state child support programs through title IV-D of the Social Security Act has, since 1996, deemed it appropriate to require all states to adopt UIFSA as a condition for the continued receipt of federal funds. Adoption of UIFSA (2008) by the states, will ensure uniformity in implementation of the treaty throughout the country and will enable the United States to be in compliance with the Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Obviously, federal action is also required, both to ratify the treaty and bring it into force. With respect to the Convention, federal legislation was necessary to implement parts of the Convention which do not directly implicate state tribunals, such as the provisions of Convention Chs. II and III dealing with Central Authorities, use of the Federal Parent Locator Service, and collection of past- due support in international cases by offset of federal tax refunds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The United States signed the treaty on November 23, 2007, signifying its intention to make good faith efforts to have the treaty adopted and implemented in this country. On September 29, 2010 the United States Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of the treaty. Federal legislation which included provisions pertaining to the treaty was passed by both the House and Senate and was signed by the President on September 29, 2014, as Public Law 113-183. This legislation requires all states to adopt UIFSA (2008). The law further requires that UIFSA (2008) be in effect in each state no later "than the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first regular session of the State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this Act." If a state has a 2-year legislative session, "each year of the session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State legislature." All states have regular legislative sessions during 2015 and, thus, all states must enact UIFSA (2008) in 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immediately following enactment of P.L. 113-183, the Commissioner of OCSE signed a policy Action Transmittal directed to all State Agencies Administering Child Support Plans under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. This transmittal reiterates the legislative requirement that each state must have in effect the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, "including any amendments adopted as of September 30, 2008." The transmittal is set forth in full below.
     </p>
     <p>
      Adoption of UIFSA(2008) by the states is not only essential to the continued federal funding of state child support programs but is key to the United States' showing of good faith implementation of the Convention and the entry into force of the Convention in this country. That implementation will help assure that American support orders are fully and expeditiously accepted and enforced in other countries. At the beginning of 2015, thirty-two countries had already ratified, acceded to the Convention, or were bound by a Regional Economic Integration Organization mandate (i.e. the European Union's means of implementation of the Convention).

      SUBJECT: P.L. 113-183 UIFSA 2008 Enactment
     </p>
     <p>
      On September 29, 2014 President Obama signed Public Law (P.L.) 113-183, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act. This law amends section 466(f) of the Social Security Act, requiring all states to enact any amendments to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act "officially adopted as of September 30, 2008 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws" (referred to as UIFSA 2008). Among other changes, the UIFSA 2008 amendments integrate the appropriate provisions of The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance, which was adopted at the Hague Conference on Private International Law on November 23, 2007, referred to as the 2007 Family Maintenance Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 301(f)(3)(A) of P.L. 113-183 requires that UIFSA 2008 must be in effect in every state "no later than the effective date of laws enacted by the legislature of the State implementing such paragraph, but in no event later than the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first regular session of the State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this Act." If a state has a 2-year legislative session, "each year of the session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State legislature."
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2008, after the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the UIFSA 2008 amendments, several states asked OCSE if their state legislatures could enact UIFSA 2008. At that time, section 466(f) of the Social Security Act required states to adopt UIFSA 1996, a previous version to UIFSA 2008. OCSE issued DCL-08-41, which permitted states to enact UIFSA 2008 verbatim with a provision that the effective date of its enactment be delayed until the 2007 Family Maintenance Convention is ratified and the United States deposits its instrument of ratification. States that chose to follow this process did not need to request an exemption from OCSE. Eight states passed UIFSA 2008 using the effective date language described in DCL-08-41.
     </p>
     <p>
      Due to the specific requirement in P.L. 113-183 that states enact UIFSA 2008 in their next state legislative session, OCSE rescinds DCL-08-41. The eight states that enacted UIFSA 2008 with a delayed implementation date must take the necessary legislative or administrative steps for UIFSA 2008 to be effective as directed in P.L. 113-183.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now that the President has signed P.L. 113-183, the following steps must occur before the 2007 Family Maintenance convention can enter into force for the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      o All states must enact UIFSA 2008 verbatim by the effective date noted in P.L. 113-183. Where UIFSA 2008 has bracketed language, states may use terminology appropriate under state law. In addition, P.L. 113-183 requires states to make minor revisions to the state plan which OCSE will address in forthcoming guidance.
     </p>
     <p>
      o The President must sign the instrument of ratification.
     </p>
     <p>
      o Once these activities are completed, the United States will be able to deposit its instrument of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is the depositary for the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important to note that, once UIFSA 2008 is in effect in your state, international cases will not be processed under Article 7 of UIFSA 2008 until the 2007 Family Maintenance Convention enters into force for the United States. Once this occurs, Article 7 of UIFSA 2008 will be in effect for all cases transmitted and received under the 2007 Family Maintenance Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      OCSE expresses our sincere thanks to the entire child support community for the collaborative and monumental effort taken to reach this important milestone. We look forward to working together to enact UIFSA 2008 in all states, and to implement the 2007 Family Maintenance Convention in the United States.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The terms defined in UIFSA receive a major makeover in the now-realized expectation that the Convention will enter into force in the United States at a future time. Six definitions of terms are completely new, sixteen existing definitions are amended to a greater or lesser degree, seven definitions remain basically untouched albeit six of these are renumbered, and one term is deleted because it no longer appears in the act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many crucial definitions continue to be left to local law. For example, the definitions provided by subsections (1) "child," and (2) "child-support order," refer to "the age of majority" without further elaboration. The exact age at which a child becomes an adult for different purposes is a matter for the law of each state or foreign country as is the age at which a parent's duty to furnish child support terminates. Similarly, a wide variety of other terms of art are implicitly left to state law. The new Convention provides a more explicit definition of "child" that is entirely consistent with the laws of all states.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a divergence of opinion among the several states regarding the appropriate age for termination of child support. The overwhelming number of states set ages 18 (legal adulthood for most purposes), or 19, or one of those two ages and high-school graduation, whichever comes later. Relatively few states have retained the formerly popular age of 21. And, some states extend the support obligation past age 21 if the person to be supported is engaged in higher education. Allegedly some support enforcement agencies and some tribunals have been reluctant to enforce an ongoing child support obligation past age 21, but under UIFSA it is the law of the issuing state or foreign country that makes the determination of the appropriate age for termination of support from an obligor. Because the order has been established with personal jurisdiction over the parties, it is fully enforceable under the terms of the act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the terms of the Convention, the standard obligation of a responding tribunal to enforce a child-support order is for a person "under the age of 21 years."
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Convention art. 2. Scope. However, a contracting nation may make a reservation to limit enforcement of a child- support order to "persons who have not attained the age of 18 years." Id. This possibility will not affect this act domestically because the United States does not intend to make such a reservation. Currently states will enforce another jurisdiction's order even if such an order could not have been obtained in the responding state because the child was over 18. There is no requirement to establish an order for a child over the age of 18 if that cannot be done under the local jurisdiction's law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (3) "Convention," identifies the Hague Maintenance Convention, the basis on which UIFSA (2008) was drafted. The text of the Convention may be accessed on the website of the Hague Convention on Private International Law, www.hcch.net/index. As noted above, the Convention was the result of negotiations involving more than 70 foreign nations or, in some instances political subdivisions of a foreign nation, conducted in a series of meetings from May 2003 to November 2007.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (4) "Duty of support," means the legal obligation to provide support, whether or not that duty has been the subject of an order by a tribunal. This broad definition includes both prospective and retrospective obligations to the extent they are imposed by the relevant state law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definitions in subsections (5) "foreign country," (6) "foreign support order," and (7) "foreign tribunal," are all new to UIFSA, and must be read in conjunction with the prior and the new definition of "state," now in subsection (26). Formerly, under certain circumstances a foreign country or political subdivision was declared to be a "state." Defining a foreign country or a political subdivision thereof, e.g., a Canadian province, as a "state" may be traced back to 1968, where this approach first appeared in the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (RURESA). That fiction created confusion because a foreign support order is not entitled to full faith and credit. Indeed, such orders of the sister states of the United States were only relatively recently accorded that treatment after congressional action in 1994 with the advent of the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA), 28. U.S.C. § 1738 B. Thus, constitutional analysis is not required for enforcement of foreign support orders; only state statutory issues are involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term "foreign judgment" is used only once in UIFSA (1996) and (2001) in a context that clearly intends to mean "from a sister state." If an international construction is intended, the text in UIFSA (2001) is uniformly "foreign country or political subdivision." The new definitions in UIFSA (2008) are fine-tuned to avoid ambiguity in order to ensure that "foreign" is used strictly to identify international proceedings and orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (5) requires additional careful reading; under the act "foreign country" by no means includes all foreign nations.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 102(5)(A)-(D). Countries identified by three of the four subdivisions are reasonably ascertainable. The list of reciprocating countries that have negotiated an executive agreement with the United States as described in subdivision (5)(A), known as bilateral agreements, is found on the website of the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) at http://www. acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/international/index.html.
     </p>
     <p>
      The countries described in Section 102(5)(B) have entered into an agreement with the forum state, which presumptively is known to officials of that state. A combined list of all such agreements of all states is not readily available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Countries subject to Section 102(5)(C) theoretically could require individualized determinations on a case-by-case basis. An alternative might be for each state to create an efficient method for identifying foreign countries whose laws are "substantially similar" to UIFSA. On the other hand, the "substantially similar" test to measure the laws of foreign nations has been around since 1968 without eliciting much controversy.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the future, assuming that there will be a number of countries with the Convention in force with the United States under Section 102(5)(D), the list of those countries will be well publicized.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, there are very many foreign nations that do not, and will not, fit any of the definitions of "foreign country" established in the act. At present, there are 192 member states in the United Nations. Recognition and enforcement of support orders from nations that do not meet the definition of "foreign country" may be enforceable under the doctrine of comity.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 104.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (6) "foreign support order," (7) "foreign tribunal," and (12) "issuing foreign country" set down parallel tracks for a foreign support order, foreign tribunal, and foreign issuing country throughout the act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (17) "obligor," and subsection (16) "obligee," are denominated in the Convention as "debtor" and "creditor." The terms inherently contain the legal obligation to pay or receive support, and implicitly refer to the individuals with a duty to support a child. "Obligor" includes an individual who is alleged to owe a duty of support as well as a person whose obligation has previously been determined. The one-order system of UIFSA can succeed only if the respective obligations of support are adjusted as the physical possession of a child changes between parents or involves a third-party caretaker. This must be accomplished in the context of modification, and not by the creation of multiple orders attempting to reflect each changing custody scenario. Obviously this issue is of concern not only to interstate and international child-support orders, but applies to intrastate orders as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (18) "outside this state," requires careful reading. This phrase is used in the act when the application of the provision is to be as broad as possible. Rather than limit the application of certain provisions of the act to other states, foreign countries as defined in subsection (5), or even countries whose orders are entitled to comity under Section 104, all nations and political subdivisions are truly "outside this state." For example, that term is found in Sections 316 through 18, which allow a tribunal of this state to accept information or assistance from everywhere in the world (in the court's discretion as to its effect).
     </p>
     <p>
      The definitions in subsections (23) "responding state," and (24) "responding tribunal," accommodate the direct filing of a petition under UIFSA without the intervention of an initiating tribunal. Both definitions acknowledge the possibility that there may be a responding state and a responding tribunal in a situation where there is no initiating tribunal. Under current practice, the initial application for services most often will be generated by a support enforcement agency or a central authority of a foreign country and sent to the appropriate support enforcement agency in the responding state.
     </p>
     <p>
      As discussed above in connection with subsections (5) through (7), the amended definition in subsection (26) "state," eliminates the legal fiction that a foreign country can be a state of the United States, and clarifies and implements the purpose of the act to enforce an international support order under state law. In UIFSA (2008), the term clearly is intended to refer only to a state of the United States or to other designated political entities subject to federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The vast bulk of child support establishment, enforcement, and modification in the United States is performed by the state Title IV-D agencies.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Part IV-D, Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 651 et seq. Subsection (27) "support enforcement agency," includes not only those entities, but also any other state or local governmental entities, or private agencies acting under contract with such agencies, charged with establishing or enforcing child support. A private agency falls within the definition of a support enforcement agency only as an outsource of a Title IV-D agency or specifically identified as such under Section 103.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (28) "support order" is another definition that requires more careful reading than might be immediately clear. Virtually every financial aspect of a support order regarding child support or spousal support is covered. Throughout the act "support order" means both "child support" and "spousal support." "Child support" is used when the provision applies only to support for a child. The single provision applicable solely to spousal support is Section 211. Other forms of support that might be classified as "family support," are not dealt with by UIFSA.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (29) "tribunal," takes into account that a number of states have delegated various aspects of child-support establishment and enforcement to quasi-judicial bodies and administrative agencies. The term accounts for the breadth of state variations in dealing with support orders. This usage is standard in the child-support enforcement community; private practitioners who, only rarely, are involved in such cases may still find the term unfamiliar.

      Subsection (a) provides for the identification of the tribunal or tribunals to be charged with the application of this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) performs the same function for the support enforcement agency or agencies. By its terms it indicates the legislature may designate more than one entity as authorized to enforce a support order, including a private agency. To clarify, federal law and regulations require that each state designate a "single and separate organizational unit" as the state agency that is charged with administration of the state plan and is authorized, and funded under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. Known throughout the United States as the as the "IV-D agency," it may delegate any of its functions to another state or local agency or may purchase services from any person or private agency. The IV-D agency, however, retains responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Title IV- D state plan. Moreover, by virtue of the receipt of a federal subsidy, the agency is subject to federal regulations. The legislature may also decide to provide services unrelated to, or not funded by the Title IV-D system. For example, the state legislature could identify (and fund) a private agency authorized to enforce a spousal-support order not involving child support, or could fund a public defender system to provide counsel for indigent defendants in IV-D cases.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The existence of procedures for interstate establishment, enforcement, or modification of support or a determination of parentage in UIFSA does not preclude the application of the general law of the forum. Even if the parents live in different states, for example, a petitioner may decide to file an original proceeding for child support (and most likely for other relief as well) directly in the state of residence of the respondent and proceed under that forum's generally applicable support law. In so doing, the out-of-state petitioner submits to the personal jurisdiction of the forum and, for the most part, is unaffected by UIFSA. Once a child-support order has been issued, this option is no longer available to interstate parties. Under UIFSA, a state may not permit a party to proceed to obtain a second support order; rather, in further litigation the tribunal must apply the act's provisions for enforcement of an existing order and limit modification to the strict standards of UIFSA.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section facilitates the recognition and enforcement of a support order from a nation state that is entitled to have its orders recognized by comity, but is not a "foreign country" under Section 102(5). The insertion of the term "foreign support order" to replace "support order of a foreign country or political subdivision" in subsection (a) helps clarify application of "comity" for support enforcement cases. In UIFSA, four types of nation states are defined as "foreign countries": (1) Convention countries; (2) countries with bilateral agreements with the federal government; (3) countries with bilateral agreements with particular states; and (4) countries with similar support laws. However, orders of countries that do not fall within this definition may nevertheless be enforced under "comity". Applying comity to enforce a support order of a tribunal of another nation state intends courtesy and good will, and extends due regard for the legislative, executive, and judicial acts of another nation which is not a "foreign country" as defined in Section 102.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the determination by the United States Department of State that a foreign nation is a reciprocating country is binding on all states, recognition of a support order through comity is dependent on the law of each state. The reference to "remedies under other law" is intended to recognize the principle of comity as developed in the forum state by statutory or common law, rather than to create a substantive right independent of that law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b)(1) gives notice that UIFSA is not the only means for establishing or enforcing a support order with an interstate aspect. A potential child-support obligee may voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of another state to seek the full range of desired relief under the law of that state using intrastate procedures, rather than resorting to the interstate procedure provided by UIFSA. A nonresident married parent may choose to file a proceeding in the forum state for dissolution of the marriage, including property division and spousal support, and in conjunction seek an order regarding child custody and visitation and child support. A parent may submit to the jurisdiction of another state for a determination of parentage and child support. A support order resulting from each of these scenarios implicates UIFSA. Invariably the issuing tribunal will have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its controlling child support or spousal-support order as provided by Sections 205, 207, and 211,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      , with all of the attendant application of the act to those orders. Likewise, the order or judgment of another state can be enforced without the necessity of registration under UIFSA by resort to other post-judgment enforcement remedies, such as lien, levy, execution, and filing claims in probate or bankruptcy actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, subsection (b)(2) makes clear that jurisdiction to establish child custody and visitation orders is distinct from jurisdiction for child-support orders. For the former, jurisdiction generally rests on the child's connection with the state rather than personal jurisdiction over the respondent.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      UCCJEA § 201; May v. Anderson, 345 U.S. 528 (1953) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Under the Supreme Court's case law, jurisdiction to establish a child-support order requires personal jurisdiction over the respondent.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Kulko v. Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84 (1978). If the child-support order is sought under the authority of UIFSA, the most important aspect of this rule is that a child-support obligee utilizing the provisions of UIFSA to establish child support across state lines submits to jurisdiction for child support only, and does not submit to the jurisdiction of the responding state with regard to child custody or visitation.

After the Convention comes into force in the United States, a body of case law may develop if it becomes necessary to resolve unanticipated differences between this act and the Convention.

        General Jurisdictional Principle:
       </i>
      </b>
      Sections 201 and 202 contain what is commonly described as long-arm jurisdiction over a nonresident respondent for purposes of establishing a support order or determining parentage. Read together, subsections (a) and (b) provide the basic jurisdictional rules established by the act for interstate application of a support order, and are designed to be as broad as is constitutionally permissible. To sustain enforceability of a family support order in the United States the tribunal must be able to assert personal jurisdiction over the parties.
      <i>
       See
      </i>

        Long-arm Provisions:
       </i>
      </b>
      Inclusion of this long-arm provision in this interstate act is justified because residents of two separate states are involved in the litigation, both of whom must be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the forum. Thus, the case has a clear interstate aspect, despite the fact that the substantive and procedural law of the forum state is applicable to a lawsuit in what is a one-state case. This rationale is sufficient to invoke additional UIFSA provisions in an otherwise intrastate proceeding.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Sections 202, 316, and 318, as pertaining to special rules of evidence and discovery for UIFSA cases. The intent is to ensure that every enacting state has a long-arm statute that is as broad as constitutionally permitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      In situations in which the long-arm statute can be satisfied, the petitioner (either the obligor or the obligee) has two options: (1) utilize the long-arm statute to obtain personal jurisdiction over the respondent, or, (2) initiate a two-state proceeding under the succeeding provisions of UIFSA seeking to establish a support order in the respondent's state of residence. Of course, a third option is also available that does not implicate UIFSA; a petitioner may initiate a proceeding in the respondent's state of residence by filing a proceeding to settle all issues between the parties in a single proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under RURESA, multiple support orders affecting the same parties were commonplace. UIFSA created a structure designed to provide for only one support order at a time. The new one-order regime is facilitated and combined with a broad assertion of personal jurisdiction under this long- arm provision. The frequency of a two-state procedure involving the participation of tribunals in both states has been substantially reduced by the introduction of this long-arm statute.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       <i>
        Subsection by subsection analyses:
       </i>
      </b>
      Subsections (1) through (8) are derived from a variety of sources, including the Uniform Parentage Act (1973) § 8, Texas Family Code § 102.011, and New York Family Court Act § 154.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (1) codifies the holding of Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604 (1990), which reaffirms the constitutional validity of asserting personal jurisdiction based on personal service within a state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (2) expresses the principle that a nonresident party concedes personal jurisdiction by seeking affirmative relief or by submitting to the jurisdiction by answering or entering an appearance. However, the power to assert jurisdiction over an issue involving child support under the act does not necessarily extend the tribunal's jurisdiction to other matters. As noted above, family law is rife with instances of bifurcated jurisdiction. For example, a tribunal may have jurisdiction to establish a child-support order based on personal jurisdiction over the obligor under Section 201, but lack jurisdiction over child custody, which is a matter of status adjudication usually based on the home state of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (3) through (6) identify specific fact situations justifying the assertion of long-arm jurisdiction over a nonresident. Each provides an appropriate affiliating nexus for such an assertion, when judged on a case-by-case basis with an eye on procedural and substantive due process. Further, each subsection does contain a possibility that an overly literal construction of the terms of the statute will overreach due process. For example, subsection (3) provides that long-arm jurisdiction to establish a support order may be asserted if "the individual resided with the child in this state." The typical scenario contemplated by the statute is that the parties lived as a family unit in the forum state, separated, and one of the parents subsequently moved to another state while the other parent and the child continued to reside in the forum. No time frame is stated for filing a proceeding; this is based on the fact that the absent parent has a support obligation that extends for at least the minority of the child (and longer in some states).
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, suppose that the two parents and their child lived in State A for many years and then decided to move the family to State B to seek better employment opportunities. Those opportunities did not materialize and, after several weeks or a few months of frustration with the situation, one of the parents returned with the child to State A. Under these facts, a tribunal of State A may conclude it has long-arm jurisdiction to establish the support obligation of the absent parent. But, suppose that the family's sojourn in State B lasted for many years, and then one parent unilaterally decides to return to State A. It is reasonable to expect that a tribunal will conclude that assertion of personal jurisdiction over the absent parent immediately after the return based on subsection (3) would offend due process. Note the provisions of UIFSA are available to the returning parent to establish child support in State B, and that state will have long-arm jurisdiction to establish support binding on the moving parent under Section 201.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      also Section 204 for the resolution of simultaneous proceedings provided by the act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The factual situations catalogued in the first seven subsections are appropriate and constitutionally acceptable grounds upon which to exercise personal jurisdiction over an individual. Subsection (7) is bracketed because not all states maintain putative father registries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, subsection (8) tracks the broad, catch-all provisions found in many state statutes, including Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 410.10 (1973), and Tex. Family Code § 102.011. Note, however, that the California provision, standing alone, was found to be inadequate to sustain a child-support order under the facts presented in Kulko v. Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84 (1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       <i>
        Limit on Asserting Long-arm Jurisdiction to Modify Child-Support Order:
       </i>
      </b>
      Subsection (b) elaborates on the principle by providing that modification of an existing child-support order goes beyond the usual rules of personal jurisdiction over the parties. Amended in UIFSA (2001), subsection (b) makes clear long-arm personal jurisdiction over a respondent, standing alone, is not sufficient to grant subject matter jurisdiction to a responding tribunal of the state of residence of the petitioner for that tribunal to modify an existing child-support order.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      the extended commentaries to Sections 609 through 616. The limitations on modification of a child-support order provided by Section 611 must be observed irrespective of the existence of personal jurisdiction over the parties.
     </p>
     <p>
      For tribunals of the United States, these sections integrate the concepts of personal jurisdiction and its progeny, continuing jurisdiction, and controlling orders. Note that the long-arm provisions of UIFSA (1992) were originally written with only domestic cases in mind. If the tribunal of a state has personal jurisdiction over an individual residing in another state (or, by implication, a foreign country), the application of local law is entitled to recognition and enforcement.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, a.k.a. FFCCSOA, 28 U.S.C. § 1738B. Integrating this federal law based on the Constitution with the statutory rule of subject matter jurisdiction for modification of an existing child-support order is a major accomplishment of UIFSA. Obviously, the federal act is applicable to a child-support order issued by a state tribunal, but is not applicable to a foreign support order. Nor does FFCCSOA in any way affect a foreign country, which will apply its local law of recognition, enforcement, and modification to a child-support order originating from a state of the United States. When the Convention enters into force, the integration of UIFSA and the law of some foreign countries will be international in scope. At that time the jurisdictional rules of all concerned become significantly more complex.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 708. Nonetheless, it seems likely the complexity will be more theoretical than actually troublesome.

       <i>
        Applicability of Long-Arm Jurisdiction to Spousal Support:
       </i>
      </b>
      Although this long-arm statute applies to a spousal-support order, almost all of the specific provisions of this section relate to a child-support order or a determination of parentage. This derives from the fact that the focus of UIFSA is primarily on child support. Only subsections (1), (2), and (8) are applicable to an action for spousal support asserting long-arm jurisdiction over a nonresident. The first two subsections are wholly noncontroversial insofar as an assertion of personal jurisdiction is concerned. Moreover, as a practical matter, an assertion of personal jurisdiction under UIFSA will almost always also yield jurisdiction over all matters to be decided between the spouses, including division of property on divorce. Thus, the most obvious possible basis for asserting long-arm jurisdiction over spousal support, i.e., "last matrimonial domicile," is not included in Section 201 to avoid the potential problem of another instance of bifurcated jurisdiction. This restraint avoids a situation in which UIFSA would arguably grant long-arm jurisdiction for a spousal-support order when the forum state has no correlative statute for property division in divorce.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       <i>
        Potential Application of Long-arm Jurisdiction to Foreign Support Order:
       </i>
      </b>
      If the facts of a case warrant, whether in an interstate or an international context, a state tribunal shall apply long-arm jurisdiction to establish a support order without regard to the physical location or residence of a party outside the United States. Interestingly, under certain fact situations involving a request to recognize and enforce or modify a foreign support order, a state tribunal may be called upon to determine the applicability of long-arm jurisdiction under UIFSA to the facts of the case in order to decide the enforceability of the foreign support order.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, a challenge to a request for enforcement of a foreign support order may be made by a respondent based on an allegation that the foreign issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the respondent. A respondent may acknowledge that the obligee or the child resides in France, and that a French tribunal issued a support order. But, in the
      <i>
       Kulko
      </i>
      decision the Court accepted the respondent's allegation that under the state law then available there was no nexus between himself and California and therefore no personal jurisdiction over him as required by the opinion. From the perspective of the French tribunal under the facts above, an asserted lack of personal jurisdiction is of no consequence. Under the law of France, like the law of virtually all other foreign nations, the child-based jurisdiction stemming from the residence of the obligee or child is sufficient to sustain a child-support order against the noncustodial parent. But, meshing the world-wide system of child-based jurisdiction with the U.S. requirement of
      <i>
       in personam
      </i>
      jurisdiction presented an easily resolved challenge to the drafters of the new Hague Maintenance Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thus, under the Convention, a state tribunal may be called upon to determine whether the facts underlying the support order would have provided the issuing foreign tribunal with personal jurisdiction over the respondent under the standards of this section. In effect, the question is whether the foreign tribunal would have been able to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Section 201. The foregoing fact situation illustrates that it is for the state tribunal to determine if the order of the French tribunal would have complied with UIFSA Section 201 on the facts of the case. If so, the foreign support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement. For example, the facts of the case may show that the father lived with the child in France, supported the mother or child in France, or perhaps was responsible for, or agreed to the movement of the child to France.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, if the issuing French tribunal would have lacked personal jurisdiction over the respondent if Section 201 had been applicable, the support order cannot be enforced because there was no nexus between France and the respondent. The United States will make a reservation to Convention article 20, declining to recognize or enforce a foreign support order on child-based jurisdiction founded solely on the location or residence of the obligee or the child in the foreign country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interestingly, if the responding state tribunal finds the French tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the respondent, additional action may be taken. In a Convention case, the responding state tribunal may establish a child-support order if it has personal jurisdiction over the respondent without requesting a separate application for establishment of a new order.

      It is a useful legal truism after a tribunal of a state issues a support order binding on the parties, which must be based on personal jurisdiction by virtue of
      <i>
       Kulko v. Superior Court
      </i>
      , 436 U.S. 84 (1978) and
      <i>
       Vanderbilt v. Vanderbilt
      </i>
      , 354 U.S. 416 (1957), jurisdiction in personam continues for the duration of the support obligation absent the statutorily specified reasons to terminate the order. The rule established by UIFSA is that the personal jurisdiction necessary to sustain enforcement or modification of an order of child support or spousal support persists as long as the order is in force and effect, even as to arrears,
      <i>

      </i>
      Sections 205-207, 211,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      . This is true irrespective of the context in which the support order arose, e.g., divorce, UIFSA support establishment, parentage establishment, modification of prior controlling order, etc. Insofar as a child-support order is concerned, depending on specific factual circumstances a distinction is made between retaining continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify an order and having continuing jurisdiction to enforce an order,

      Sections 205 and 206,

      This section identifies the two roles a tribunal of the forum may serve: acting as either an initiating or a responding tribunal.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Sections 304 and 305 for the duties and powers of the tribunal in each of these capacities. Under UIFSA, a tribunal may serve as a responding tribunal even when there is no initiating tribunal. This accommodates the direct filing of a proceeding in a responding tribunal by a nonresident of the forum, whether residing in a state or anywhere else in the world. Note, however, that the section does not deal with whether an initiating tribunal of a state may forward a proceeding to a tribunal in a foreign country, which may be left to the individual support enforcement agency.

     <p>
      Under the one-order system established by UIFSA, it was necessary to provide a procedure to eliminate the multiple orders so common under RURESA and URESA. This requires cooperation between, and deference by, state tribunals in order to avoid issuance of competing support orders. To this end, tribunals are expected to take an active role in seeking out information about support proceedings in another state or foreign country concerning the same child. Depending on the circumstances, one of the two tribunals considering the same support obligation should decide to defer to the other. The inclusion of a foreign country in this investigation facilitates the goal of a "one-order world" for a support obligation.
     </p>
     <p>
      UIFSA (1992) took a significant departure from the approach adopted by the UCCJA (1986) ("first filing"), by choosing the "home state of the child" as the primary factual basis for resolving competing jurisdictional disputes. Not coincidentally, this had previously been the choice for resolving jurisdiction conflicts of the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C. Section 1738A (1980). Given the pre-emptive nature of the PKPA, and the possibility that custody and support will both be involved in some cases, the PKPA/UIFSA choice for resolving disputes between competing jurisdictional assertions was followed in 1997 by the decision of NCCUSL to replace the UCCJA with the UCCJEA. If the child has no home state, however, "first filing" will control.

      This section is perhaps the most crucial provision in UIFSA. Consistent with the precedent of the federal PARENTAL KIDNAPPING PREVENTION ACT, 28 U.S.C. § 1738A, except in very narrowly defined circumstances the issuing tribunal retains continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a child-support order, commonly known as CEJ. First introduced by UIFSA in 1992, this principle is in force and widely accepted in all states. Indeed CEJ is fundamental to the principle of one-child-support-order-at-a-time.
     </p>
     <p>
      As long as one of the individual parties or the child continues to reside in the issuing state, and as long as the parties do not agree to the contrary, the issuing tribunal has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its child-support order which in practical terms means that it may modify its order. The statute takes an even-handed approach. The identity of the party remaining in the issuing state obligor or obligee does not matter. Indeed, if the individual parties have left the issuing state but the child remains behind, CEJ remains with the issuing tribunal. Even if the parties and the child no longer reside in the issuing state, the support order continues in existence and is fully enforceable unless and until a modification takes place in accordance with the requirements of Article 6,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      . Note, however, that the CEJ of the issuing tribunal over a spousal-support order is permanent,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Section 211,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a)(1) states the basic rule, and subsection (a)(2) states an exception to that rule. First, the time to measure whether the issuing tribunal has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order, or whether the parties and the child have left the state, is explicitly stated to be at the time of filing a proceeding to modify the child-support order. Second, the term in subsection (a)(1) "is the residence" makes clear that any interruption of residence of a party between the date of the issuance of the order and the date of filing the request for modification does not affect jurisdiction to modify. Thus, if there is but one order, it is the controlling order in effect and enforceable throughout the United States, notwithstanding the fact that everyone at one time had left the issuing state. If the order is not modified during this time of mutual absence, a return to reside in the issuing state by a party or child immediately identifies the proper forum at the time of filing a proceeding for modification. Although the statute does not speak explicitly to the issue, temporary absence should be treated in a similar fashion. Temporary employment in another state may not forfeit a claim of residence in the issuing state. Of course, residence is a fact question for the trial court, keeping in mind that the question is residence, not domicile.
     </p>
     <p>
      From the beginning of the implementation of the CEJ principle, questions have been raised about why a tribunal may not modify its own order if the parties agree that it should do so even after the parties have left the state. The move of the parties and the child from the state may have been of a very short distance and, although the parties no longer reside in the issuing state, they may prefer to continue to have the child-support order be governed by the same issuing tribunal because they continue to have a strong affiliation with it. For example, the child-support order may have been issued by a tribunal of Washington, D.C. Subsequently the obligee and child have moved to Virginia, the obligor now resides in Maryland, and perhaps one or both parties continue to be employed in Washington. Subsection (a)(2) authorizes retention of CEJ by the issuing state when the parties reasonably may prefer to continue to deal with the issuing tribunal even though the state is "not the residence" of the parties or child as an exception to the general rules of CEJ for modifications of a support order.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other side of the coin follows logically. Just as subsection (a) defines the retention of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, by clear implication the subsection also identifies how jurisdiction to modify may be lost. That is, if all the relevant persons the obligor, the individual obligee, and the child have permanently left the issuing state, absent an agreement the issuing tribunal no longer has an appropriate nexus with the parties or child to justify the exercise of jurisdiction to modify its child-support order. Further, the issuing tribunal will have no current evidence readily available to it about the factual circumstances of anyone involved, and the taxpayers of that state will have no reason to expend public funds on the process. Note, however, that the original order of the issuing tribunal remains valid and enforceable. That order is in effect not only in the issuing state, but also in those states in which the order has been registered. The order also may be registered and enforced in additional states even after the issuing tribunal has lost its power to modify its order, see Sections 601-604,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      . In sum, the original order remains in effect until it is properly modified in accordance with the narrow terms of Sections 609-612,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b)(1) explicitly provides that the parties may agree in a record that the issuing tribunal should relinquish its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify so that a tribunal in another state may assume CEJ to modify the child-support order. It is believed that such consent seldom occurs because of the almost universal desire of each party to prefer his or her local tribunal. The principle that the parties should be allowed to agree upon an alternate forum if they so choose also extends to a situation in which all the parties and the child have left the issuing state and are in agreement that a tribunal of the state in which only the movant resides shall assume modification jurisdiction,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Section 611.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although subsections (a) and (b) identify the methods for the retention and the loss of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction by the issuing tribunal, this section does not confer jurisdiction to modify on another tribunal. Modification requires that a tribunal have personal jurisdiction over the parties and meet other criteria as provided in Sections 609 through 615,

      <p>
       This section is the correlative of the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction described in the preceding section. It makes the relatively subtle distinction between the CEJ "to modify a support order" established in Section 205 and the "continuing jurisdiction to enforce" established in this section. A keystone of UIFSA is that the power to enforce the order of the issuing tribunal is not "exclusive" with that tribunal. Rather, on request one or more responding tribunals may also exercise authority to enforce the order of the issuing tribunal. Secondly, under the one-order-at-a-time system, the validity and enforceability of the controlling order continues unabated until it is fully complied with, unless it is replaced by a modified order issued in accordance with the standards established by Sections 609-616. That is, even if the individual parties and the child no longer reside in the issuing state, the controlling order remains in effect and may be enforced by the issuing tribunal or any responding tribunal without regard to the fact that the potential for its modification and replacement exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) authorizes the issuing tribunal to initiate a request for enforcement of its order by a tribunal of another state if its order is controlling,
       <i>
        see
       </i>
       Section 207, or to request reconciliation of the arrears and interest due on its order if another order is controlling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) reiterates that the issuing tribunal has jurisdiction to serve as a responding tribunal to enforce its own order at the request of another tribunal.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the introduction of the concepts of one-order and continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in Section 205, another dramatic founding principle of UIFSA was to establish a system whereby the multiple orders created by URESA and RURESA could be reconciled in the transition from a world with multiple child-support orders to a one-order-at-a-time world. This principle introduced by Section 207 was subsequently incorporated into the requirements of 28 USC 1738B, Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders, a.k.a. FFCCSOA.
     </p>
     <p>
      The combination of FFCCSOA becoming effective on October 20, 1994 and the adoption of UIFSA (1996) being mandated for all states by January 1, 1998, has made this section almost never used. The existence of multiple, valid orders for ongoing support have all but disappeared.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sections 209-210, and especially Section 207, are designed to span the gulf between the one-order system created by UIFSA and the multiple-order system previously in place under RURESA and URESA. These transitional procedures necessarily must provide for the eventual elimination of existing multiple support orders in an expeditious and efficient manner. Although FFCCSOA was effective October 20, 1994 and all U.S. jurisdictions enacted UIFSA by 1998, considerable time is required to pass before its one-order system could be completely in place. For example, multiple 21-year child-support orders issued for an infant in 1996 and 1997 would, by their terms, not end the conflict until the first expires 2017 absent resolution of the conflict by a tribunal under this section. Nonetheless, at least on the appellate level, the problem of multiple orders is fast disappearing. This section provides a relatively simple procedure to identify a single viable order that will be entitled to prospective enforcement in every state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) declares that if only one child-support order exists, it is to be denominated the controlling order, irrespective of when and where it was issued and whether any of the individual parties or the child continue to reside in the issuing state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) establishes the priority scheme for recognition and prospective enforcement of a single order among existing multiple orders regarding the same obligor, obligee, and child. A tribunal requested to sort out the multiple orders and determine which one will be prospectively controlling of future payments must have personal jurisdiction over the litigants in order to ensure that its decision is binding on all concerned. For UIFSA to function, one order must be denominated as the controlling order, and its issuing tribunal must be recognized as having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. In choosing among existing multiple orders, none of which can be distinguished as being in conflict with the principles of UIFSA, subsection (b)(1) gives first priority to an order issued by the only tribunal that is entitled to continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under the terms of UIFSA, i.e., an individual party or the child continues to reside in that state and no other state meets this criterion. If two or more tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under the act, subsection (b)(2) first looks to the tribunal of the child's current home state. If that tribunal has not issued a support order, subsection (b)(2) looks next to the order most recently issued. Finally, subsection (b)(3) provides that if none of the existing multiple orders are entitled to be denominated as the controlling order because none of the preceding priorities apply, the forum tribunal is directed to issue a new order, given that it has personal jurisdiction over the obligor and obligee. The new order becomes the controlling order, establishes the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal, and fixes the support obligation and its nonmodifiable aspects, primarily duration of support,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Sections 604 and 611(c),
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      . The rationale for creating a new order to replace existing multiple orders is that there is no valid reason to prefer the terms of any one of the multiple orders over another in the absence of a fact situation described in subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2).
     </p>
     <p>
      As originally promulgated, UIFSA did not come to grips with whether existing multiple orders issued by different states might be entitled to full faith and credit without regard to the determination of the controlling order under the act. The drafters took the position that state law, however uniform, could not interfere with the ultimate interpretation of a constitutional directive. Fortunately, this question has almost certainly been mooted by the 1996 amendment to 28 U.S.C. § 1738B, Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders. Congress incorporated the multiple order recognition provisions of Section 207 of UIFSA into FFCCSOA virtually word for word in the PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1996. Pub. L. 104-193, Aug. 22, 1996, 110 Stat. 2221.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not altogether clear whether the terms of UIFSA apply to a strictly intrastate case; that is, a situation in which multiple child-support orders have been issued by multiple tribunals of a single state and the parties and the child continue to reside in that state. This is not an uncommon situation, often traceable to the intrastate applicability of RURESA. A literal reading of the statutory language suggests the section applies. Further, FFCCSOA does not make a distinction regarding the tribunals that issued multiple orders. If multiple orders have been issued by different tribunals in the home state of the child, most likely the most recent will be recognized as the controlling order, notwithstanding the fact that UIFSA Section 207 (b)(2)(B), and FFCCSOA 42 U.S.C. § 1738B(f)(3), literally do not apply. At the very least, this section, together with FFCCSOA, provide a template for resolving such conflicts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) clarifies that any party or a support enforcement agency may request a tribunal of the forum state to identify the controlling order. That party is directed to fully inform the tribunal of all existing child-support orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) seeks to assure the tribunal is furnished with all the information needed to make a proper determination of the controlling order, as well as the information needed to make a calculation of the consolidated arrears. The party or support enforcement agency requesting the determination of controlling order and determination of consolidated arrears is also required to notify all other parties and entities who may have an interest in either of those determinations. Those with such an interest most likely are support agencies and the obligee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (e) provides that the determination of the controlling order under this section has the effect of establishing the tribunal with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction; only the order of that tribunal is entitled to prospective enforcement by a sister state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) directs the forum tribunal to identify the details upon which it makes its determination of the controlling order. In addition, the tribunal is also directed to state specifically the amount of the prospective support, and to reconcile and consolidate the arrears and interest due on all of the multiple orders to the extent possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      The party obtaining the determination is directed by subsection (g) to notify all interested tribunals of the decision after the fact. Although tribunals need not be given original notice of the proceeding, all tribunals that have contributed an order to the determination must be informed regarding which order was determined to be controlling, and should also be informed of the consolidated arrears and interest so that the extent of possible subsequent enforcement will be known with regard to each of the orders. The act does not deal with the resolution of potential conflicting claims regarding arrears; this is left to case-by-case decisions or to federal regulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 207 presumes that the parties are accorded notice and opportunity to be heard by the tribunal. It also presumes that the tribunal will be fully informed about all existing orders when it is requested to determine which one of the existing multiple child-support orders is to be accorded prospective enforcement. If this does not occur and one or more existing orders is not considered by the tribunal, the finality of its decision is likely to turn on principles of estoppel on a case-by-case basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, subsection (h), affirms the concept that when a fully informed tribunal makes a determination of the controlling order for prospective enforcement, or renders a judgment for the amount of the consolidated arrears, the decision is entitled to full faith and credit.

       COMMENT

     </p>
     <p>
      This section is concerned with those multiple orders that involve two or more families of the same obligor. Although all such orders are entitled to enforcement, practical difficulties frequently exist. For example, full enforcement of each of the multiple orders may exceed the maximum allowed for income withholding. The federal statute, 42 U.S.C. § 666(b)(1), requires that to be eligible for the federal funding for enforcement, states must provide a ceiling for child-support withholding expressed in a percentage that may not exceed the federal law limitations on wage garnishment, Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968, 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b). In order to allocate resources between competing families, UIFSA refers to state law. The basic principle is that one or more support orders for an out-of-state family of the obligor, and one or more orders for an in-state family, are of equal dignity. In allocating payments to different obligees, every child-support order should be treated as if it had been issued by a tribunal of the forum state, that is, preferential treatment for a local family over an out-of-state family is prohibited by local law. The addition of a foreign support order to the formula supplied by this section should assure that all children will have equal ability to obtain their share of child support.

      The issuing tribunal is ultimately responsible for the overall control of the enforcement methods employed and for accounting for the payments made on its order from multiple sources. Until that scheme is fully in place, however, it will be necessary to continue to mandate pro tanto credit for actual payments made against all existing orders. The addition to include a foreign support order in the calculation should assure all payments of support are properly credited. This section does not attempt to impact the way support paid in an individual case is apportioned or distributed between the obligee and one or more states asserting a claim to the monies.

     <p>
      Assertion of long-arm jurisdiction over a nonresident results in a one-state proceeding without regard to the fact that one of the parties resides in a different state or in a foreign country. On obtaining personal jurisdiction the tribunal must apply the law of the forum. Once personal jurisdiction has been asserted over a nonresident, the issuing tribunal retains continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) to modify, and continuing jurisdiction to enforce a support order in accordance with the provisions of the act. Of course, it is far more common for a support order to be issued in conjunction with a divorce or determination of parentage in which both the obligor and obligee are residents of the forum than to be issued as a result of an assertion of long-arm jurisdiction. Note that either the petitioner or the respondent may be the nonresident party (either of whom may be the obligor or the obligee). Also note that absent this provision, the ordinary intrastate substantive and procedural law of the forum would apply to either fact situation without reference to the fact that one of the parties is a nonresident. Thus, CEJ applies whether the matter at hand involves establishment of an original support order or enforcement or modification of an existing order. In any event, if one of the parties resides outside the forum state, the nonresident may avail himself or herself of the special evidentiary and discovery provisions provided by UIFSA.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section makes clear that the special rules of evidence and procedure identified in Sections 316, 317, and 318 are applicable in a case involving a nonresident of the forum state. Section 316 facilitates decision-making when a party or a child resides "outside this state" by providing special rules to recognize the impediments to presenting evidence caused by nonresident status. Note the terminology has the broadest possible application, i.e., worldwide. The improved interstate and international exchange of information enables the nonresident to participate as fully as possible in the proceedings without the necessity of personally appearing in the forum state. The same considerations account for authorizing interstate and international communications between tribunals as per Section 317. Finally, the discovery procedures of Section 318 are made applicable in a one- state proceeding when another tribunal may assist in that process. Of course, "may assist" is entirely at the discretion of the other tribunal. Note, a foreign tribunal may be completely unfamiliar with discovery procedures as known in the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Generally, however, the ordinary substantive and procedural law of the forum state applies in a one- state proceeding. In sum, the parties and the tribunal in a one-state case may utilize those procedures that contribute to economy, efficiency, and fair play.

       The amendment to subsection (b) ensures that the restriction on modification of an out-of-state spousal-support order extends to a foreign order. At the same time, subsection (b) provides that the question of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction be resolved under the law of the issuing tribunal. Thus, if a foreign spousal- support order were subject to modification in another country by the law of the issuing tribunal, this section would permit modification in a tribunal of this state.

      INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This article adds a wide variety of procedural provisions to existing statutory and procedural rules for civil cases. If there is a conflict between those provisions found for other litigation and UIFSA rules set forth in this article, obviously UIFSA rules prevail. For example, it is unlikely that a state will have a provision for testimony by telephone or audiovisual means in a final hearing. Section 316 of this act creates such a right for an out-of-state individual. Revisions in this article shift the perspective slightly to accommodate the inclusion of a foreign support order in the equation. Many, but not all, of the provisions in this article are based upon the fact that a party does not "reside in this state." Application of these provisions is not solely based on whether the absent party resides in "another state," as formerly was the case. Rather, three distinct formulations are employed depending on the intended application of the provisions: "residing in a state;" "residing in . . . a foreign country;" or "residing outside this state." The third alternative is intentionally the broadest because it includes persons residing anywhere and is not limited to persons residing in a "foreign country" as defined in Section 102.

     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) mandates application of the general provisions of this article to all UIFSA proceedings, including those affecting a foreign support order.
     </p>
     <p>
      The statement in subsection (b) is axiomatic that the tribunal in which a petition is filed for establishment or enforcement of a support order, or for modification of a child-support order, must be able to assert personal jurisdiction over the respondent. It is also axiomatic that an individual petitioner requesting affirmative relief under this act submits to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal. Subsection (b) also continues reference to the basic two-state procedure long employed by the former reciprocal acts to establish a support order in the interstate context, but expands it to recognize foreign countries. Direct filing of a petition in a state tribunal by an individual or a support enforcement agency without reference to an initiating tribunal in another state was introduced by UIFSA (1992). UIFSA (2008) extends the direct filing capability to foreign countries as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the filing of a petition in an initiating tribunal to be forwarded to a responding tribunal is still recognized as an available procedure, the direct filing procedure has proven to be one of the most significant improvements in efficient interstate case management. The promulgation and use of the federally mandated, or substantially conforming, forms, Section 311(b), further serves to eliminate any role for the initiating tribunal. Incidentally, the Convention contains approved forms for use in Convention cases processed through a Central Authority.

     <p>
      Historically states have insisted that forum law be applied to support cases whenever possible. This continues to be a key principle of UIFSA. In general, a responding tribunal has the same powers in a proceeding involving parties in a case with interstate or international effect as it has in an intrastate case. This inevitably means that the act is not self-contained; rather, it is supplemented by the forum's statutes and procedures governing support orders. To insure the efficient processing of the huge number of interstate support cases, it is vital that decision makers apply familiar rules of law to the maximum degree possible. This must be accomplished in a manner consistent with the overriding principle of UIFSA that enforcement is of the issuing tribunal's order, and that the responding state does not make the order its own as a condition of enforcing it.

      Subsection (a) was designed primarily to facilitate interstate enforcement between UIFSA states and URESA and RURESA states, with some applicability to cases involving foreign jurisdictions. Since 1998, by which time UIFSA had been enacted nationwide, the procedure described has gradually become an anachronism. Note, however, that the last RURESA child-support order may not expire until 2017 or 2018.
      <i>

      </i>
      Prefatory Note.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b), however, retains its utility with regard to a support order of a foreign nation. Supplying documentation required by a foreign jurisdiction, which is not otherwise required by UIFSA procedure, is appropriate in the international context. For example, a venerable process in British Commonwealth countries is known as provisional and confirming orders. A "provisional order" is a statement of the nonbinding amount of support being requested by a Canadian tribunal for establishment of a support order by a state responding tribunal. A state responding tribunal will receive information about the amount of support provisionally calculated by a tribunal in Canada. It needs to be borne in mind that a request to establish support from a Canadian tribunal will be accomplished in accordance with the law of the responding state. Thus, the Canadian provisional order is informative, but not binding on the responding tribunal. An order issued by the responding tribunal, whether for the amount suggested in the provisional order or another amount based on the local law of the responding tribunal, is known as a confirming order. Similarly, the initiating state's tribunal, knowing that a provisional order will be required by the Canadian tribunal, is directed to cooperate and provide a statement of the amount of support being provisionally requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      The initiating tribunal of this state also has a duty to identify the amount of foreign currency equivalent to its request to the Canadian tribunal and a corresponding duty for a responding tribunal to convert the foreign currency into dollars if the foreign initiating tribunal has not done so, Section 305(f). The reference to "the applicable official or market exchange rate" takes into account the present practices of international money markets. A few countries continue to maintain an official exchange rate for their currency. The vast majority of countries recognize the fact that the value of their currency is subject to daily market fluctuations that are reported on the financial pages of many daily newspapers. Thus, in the example described above, a request for a specific amount of support in U.S. dollars, which is to be translated into Canadian dollars on a specific date, will inevitably have a variable value as the foreign currency rises or falls against the U.S. dollar.

       COMMENT

     </p>
     <p>
      This section establishes a wide variety of duties for a responding tribunal. It contains: ministerial functions, subsection (a); judicial functions, subsection (b); and, substantive rules applicable to interstate cases, subsections (c)-(e). Because a responding tribunal may be an administrative agency rather than a court, the act explicitly states that a tribunal is not granted powers that it does not otherwise possess under state law. For example, authority to enforce a support order by contempt generally is limited to courts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) directs the filing of the documents received without regard to whether an initiating tribunal in another state was involved in forwarding the documentation. It also directs that the individual or entity requesting the filing be notified, but leaves the means of that notification to local law. The advent of a variety of swifter, and perhaps even more reliable, forms of notice in the modern era justifies the deletion of a particular form of notice. For example, many states now authorize notice by telephone facsimile (FAX), or by an express delivery service, and many legal documents are transmitted by electronic mail (email).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) lists duties that, if possessed under state law in connection with intrastate cases, are extended to the responding tribunal in UIFSA cases. Thus, each subdivision purposefully avoids mention of substantive rules. For example, subsection (b)(7) does not identify the type, nature, or priority of liens that may be issued under UIFSA. As is generally true under the act, those details will be determined by applicable state law concerning support enforcement remedies of local orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) clarifies that the details of calculating the child-support order are to be included along with the order. Local law generally requires that variation from the child support guidelines must be explained,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      42 U.S.C. § 667; this requirement is extended to interstate cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) states that an interstate support order may not be conditioned on compliance with a visitation order. While this may be at variance with state law governing intrastate cases, under a UIFSA proceeding the petitioner generally is not present before the tribunal. This distinction justifies prohibiting visitation issues from being litigated in the context of a support proceeding. All states have enacted some version of either the UCCJA or the UCCJEA providing for resolution of visitation issues in interstate cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (e) introduces the policy determination that the petitioner, the respondent, and the initiating tribunal, if any, shall be kept informed about actions taken by the responding tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) is designed to facilitate enforcement of a foreign support order. Note that the language directing a conversion to a monetary equivalence in dollars is intended to make clear the equivalence is not a modification of the original order to an absolute dollar figure; rather, satisfaction of the obligation is to be determined by the order-issuing tribunal based on the present dollar value of the currency in which the order is denominated.

      If a [petition] or comparable pleading is received by an inappropriate tribunal of this state, the tribunal shall forward the pleading and accompanying documents to an appropriate tribunal of this state or another state and notify the [petitioner] where and when the pleading was sent. A tribunal receiving UIFSA documents in error is to forward the original documents to their proper destination without undue delay. This section was originally intended to apply both to initiating and responding tribunals receiving such documents, but the practical elimination of the role of initiating tribunals under modern practice now limits the notice requirement to the petitioner, i.e., the individual party or support enforcement agency, that filed (or misfiled) the document directly. For example, if a tribunal is inappropriately designated as the responding tribunal, it shall forward the petition to the appropriate responding tribunal wherever located, if known, and notify the petitioner of its action. Such a procedure is much to be preferred to returning the documents to the petitioner to begin the process anew.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cooperation of this sort will facilitate the ultimate goals of the act. Although by its terms this section applies only to a tribunal of this state, it can be anticipated that the support enforcement agency will also assist in transferring documents to the appropriate tribunal. Note the section does not contemplate that a state tribunal will forward documents to a tribunal in a foreign country.

     <p>
      Federal legislation signed on Sept. 29, 2014 (P.L. 113-183) authorizes states to enact Alternative A or Alternative B of subsection (a). The focus of subsection (a) is on providing services to a petitioner. Either the obligee or the obligor may request services, and that request may be in the context of the establishment of an initial child-support order, enforcement or review and adjustment of an existing child-support order, or a modification of that order (upward or downward). Note that the section does not distinguish between child support and spousal support for purposes of providing services. Note also, the services available may differ significantly; for example, modification of spousal support is limited to the issuing tribunal.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 205(f).
     </p>
     <p>
      Alternative A continues the longstanding rule that this state's support enforcement agency shall provide services upon request to a petitioner seeking relief under this act. Under Alternative B, the support agency may exercise discretion to provide or not provide assistance to an applicant: (1) from a reciprocating country or Convention country who does not apply through the Central Authority of his or her own country, but rather applies directly to the support enforcement agency; and (2) residing overseas in a country other than a reciprocating country or Convention country. The lack of services, of course, may impact the means by which an individual is able to obtain assistance in pursuing an action in the appropriate tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) responds to the past complaints of many petitioners that they were not properly kept informed about the progress of their requests for services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) is a procedural clarification reflecting actual practice of the support agencies developed after years of experience with the act. It imposes a duty on all support enforcement agencies to facilitate the UIFSA one-order world by actively searching for cases with multiple orders and obtaining a determination of the controlling order as expeditiously as possible. This agency duty correlates to new Subsection 602(d) regarding the registration process and cases with multiple orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) imposes a duty of currency conversion on a support enforcement agency similar to that imposed on an initiating tribunal in Section 304(b).
     </p>
     <p>
      Read in conjunction with Section 319, subsection (e) requires the state support enforcement agency to facilitate redirection of the stream of child support in order that payments be more efficiently received by the obligee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) explicitly states that UIFSA neither creates nor rejects the establishment of an attorney-client or fiduciary relationship between the support enforcement agency and a petitioner receiving services from that agency. This once-highly controversial issue is left to otherwise applicable state law, which generally has concluded that attorneys employed by a state support enforcement agency do not form an attorney-client relationship with either the parties or the child as the ultimate obligee.

     <p>
      The right of a party to retain private counsel in a proceeding brought under UIFSA is explicitly recognized. The failure to clearly recognize that power under the prior uniform acts led to confusion and inconsistent decisions. The Convention implicitly recognizes that the right to employ an attorney is to be available in every Convention country, but does not explicitly mention retaining private counsel. A "competent authority" in Convention terminology is equivalent to a tribunal.

      This section establishes the basic requirements for drafting and filing interstate pleadings. Subsection (a) should be read in conjunction with Section 312, which provides for the confidentiality of certain information if disclosure is likely to result in harm to a party or a child. The goal of this section is to improve efficiency of the process by attaching all known support orders to the petition, coupled with the elimination of the requirement that such copies be certified. If a dispute arises over the authenticity of a purported order, the tribunal must, of necessity, sort out conflicting claims at that time. Another improvement is the deletion of the requirement for verified pleadings originated in URESA and carried forward in the original version of UIFSA. Note, however, that a request for registration of a foreign support order for which the Convention is in force is subject to Section 706. This is due to the fact that the list of documents comprising the required record in subsection (a) differs in a measurable degree with Convention articles 11 and 25.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) provides authorization for the use of the federally authorized forms to be used in interstate cases in connection with the IV-D child-support enforcement program and mandates substantial compliance with those forms. Although the use of other forms is not prohibited, standardized documents have resulted in substantial improvement in the efficient processing of UIFSA proceedings. The Convention also contains annexed forms for international use.

This section is a substantial revision of the statutory formulation originally developed in UIFSA (1992). It conforms to the comparable provision in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act Section 209. Public awareness of and sensitivity to the dangers of domestic violence has significantly increased since interstate enforcement of support originated. This section authorizes confidentiality in instances where there is a risk of domestic violence or child abduction. Section 712,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      , incorporates language from the Convention to restrict dissemination of personal jurisdiction to protect victims of domestic violence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although local law generally governs the conduct of the forum tribunal, state law may not provide for maintaining secrecy about the exact whereabouts of a litigant or other information ordinarily required to be disclosed under state law, i.e., Social Security number of the parties or the child. If so, this section creates a confidentiality provision that is particularly appropriate in light of the intractable problems associated with interstate parental kidnapping,

     </p>
     <p>
      Under subsection (a), direct or indirect participation in a UIFSA proceeding does not subject a petitioner to an assertion of personal jurisdiction over the petitioner by the forum state in other litigation between the parties. The primary object of this prohibition is to preclude joining disputes over child custody and visitation with the establishment, enforcement, or modification of child support. This prohibition strengthens the ban on visitation litigation established in Section 305(d). A petition for affirmative relief under UIFSA limits the jurisdiction of the tribunal to the boundaries of the support proceeding. In sum, proceedings under UIFSA are not suitable vehicles for the relitigation of all of the issues arising out of a foreign divorce or custody case. Only enforcement or modification of the support portion of such decrees or orders are relevant. Other issues, such as custody and visitation, or matters relating to other aspect of the divorce decree, are collateral and have no place in a UIFSA proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) grants a litigant a variety of limited immunity from service of process during the time that party is physically present in a state for a UIFSA proceeding. The immunity provided is in no way comparable to diplomatic immunity, however, which should be clear from reading subsection (c) in conjunction with the other subsections.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) does not extend immunity to civil litigation unrelated to the support proceeding which stems from contemporaneous acts committed by a party while present in the state for the support litigation. For example, a petitioner involved in an automobile accident or a contract dispute over the cost of lodging while present in the state does not have immunity from a civil suit on those issues.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Arguably this section does no more than restate the basic principle of res judicata. However, there is a great variety of state law regarding presumptions of parentage and available defenses after a prior determination of parentage. As long as a proceeding is brought in an appropriate forum, this section is intended neither to discourage nor encourage collateral attacks in situations in which the law of another jurisdiction is at significant odds with local law. If a collateral attack on a parentage decree is permissible under the law of the issuing jurisdiction, such a proceeding must be pursued in that forum and not in a UIFSA proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section mandates that a parentage decree rendered by another tribunal "pursuant to law" is not subject to collateral attack in a UIFSA proceeding. Of course, an attack on an alleged final order based on a fundamental constitutional defect in the parentage decree is permissible in the forum state. For example, a responding tribunal may find that another tribunal acted unconstitutionally by denying a party due process due to a failure of notice and opportunity to be heard or a lack of personal jurisdiction over a party who did not answer or appear. Insofar as the latter ground is concerned, the universal enactment of the long-arm statute asserting personal jurisdiction over a respondent if the child "may have been conceived" in the forum state may greatly reduce successful attacks on a parentage determination.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 201(a)(6).
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, the law of the issuing state or foreign country may provide for a determination of parentage based on certain specific acts of the obligor, such as voluntarily acknowledging parentage as a substitute for a decree. UIFSA also is neutral regarding a collateral attack on such a parentage determination filed in the issuing tribunal. In the meantime, however, the responding tribunal must give effect to such an act of acknowledgment of parentage if it is recognized as determinative in the issuing state or foreign country. The consistent theme is that a collateral attack on a parentage determination cannot be made in a UIFSA proceeding other than on fundamental due-process grounds.

       The parentage of a child is not an issue necessarily decided in a divorce or annulment action.

     </p>
     <p>
      Note that the special rules of evidence and procedure are applicable to a party or witness "residing outside this state," substituting for "residing in another state." This is the broadest application possible because the utility of these special rules is not limited to parties in other states, or in foreign countries, as defined in the act, but extends to an individual residing anywhere. This extremely broad application of the special rules is to facilitate the processing of a support order in this state or elsewhere. This section combines many time-tested procedures with innovative methods for gathering evidence in interstate cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) ensures that a nonresident petitioner or a nonresident respondent may fully participate in a proceeding under the act without being required to appear personally. Subsection (b) recognizes the pervasive effect of the federal forms promulgated by the Office of Child Support Enforcement, which replace the necessity of swearing to a document "under oath" with the simpler requirement that the document be provided "under penalty of perjury," as has long been required by federal income tax Form 1040.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (b) through (f) provide special rules of evidence designed to take into account the virtually unique nature of the interstate proceedings under this act. These subsections provide exceptions to the otherwise guiding principle of UIFSA, i.e., local procedural and substantive law should apply. Because the out-of-state party, and that party's witnesses, necessarily do not ordinarily appear in person at the hearing, deviation from the ordinary rules of evidence is justified in order to assure that the tribunal will have available to it the maximum amount of information on which to base its decision. The intent throughout these subsections is to eliminate by statute as many potential hearsay problems as possible in interstate litigation, with the goal of providing each party with the means to present evidence, even if not physically present.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) provides a simplified means for proving health-care expenses related to the birth of a child. Because ordinarily the amount of these charges is not in dispute, this is designed to obviate the cost of having health-care providers appear in person or of obtaining affidavits of business records from each provider.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (e) and (f) encourage tribunals and litigants to take advantage of modern methods of communication in interstate support litigation; most dramatically, the out-of-state party is authorized to testify by the full panoply of audio and audiovisual technologies currently available for direct personal communication and to supply documents by fax, email, or direct transfer between computers or other electronic devices. One of the most useful applications of these subsections is to provide an enforcing tribunal with up-to-date information concerning the amount of arrears.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) unambiguously mandates that telephone or audiovisual testimony in depositions and hearings must be allowed. It anticipates that every courtroom is equipped with a speakerphone. In a day when laptop computers often come equipped with a video camera, live testimony from a remote location is not only possible, but almost as reliable as if the testimony was given in person. No doubt a demeanor is better judged in person than by viewing a video screen, but the latter is certainly preferable to only a disembodied voice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (g) codifies the rule in effect in many states that in civil litigation an adverse inference may be drawn from a litigant's silence that restriction of the Fifth Amendment does not apply. A related analogy is that a refusal to submit to genetic testing may be admitted into evidence and a trier of fact may resolve the question of parentage against the refusing party on the basis of an inference that the results of the test would have been unfavorable to the interest of that party.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (j), new in 2001, complies with the federally mandated procedure that every state must honor the "acknowledgment of paternity" validly made in another state.

     <p>
      This section explicitly authorizes a state tribunal to communicate with a tribunal of another state, foreign country, or in a foreign nation state not defined as a foreign country. It was derived from UCCJA § 110 authorizing such communications to facilitate a fully informed decision. The amendment in UIFSA (2008) not only expands the authorization to worldwide scope, i.e., "outside this state," but specifically adds email to the select modes of communication. Broad cooperation by tribunals is strongly encouraged in order to expedite establishment and enforcement of a support order. American judges are very familiar with this procedure. It remains to be seen whether overseas communication between judges will be received with similar cooperation.

     <p>
      The first sentence of subsection (a) is truly hortatory in nature, although its principle is implemented insofar as support enforcement agencies are required by federal regulations promulgated by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). The second sentence confirms the duty of the agency or tribunal to furnish payment information in interstate or international cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      As an exception to the usual provisions in Article 3, subsections (b) and (c) are applicable only to interstate cases. The procedure described was inspired by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and is designed to speed up receipt of support payments. Support enforcement agencies are directed to cooperate in the efficient and expeditious collection and transfer of child support from obligor to obligee. Over two-thirds of all child support payments currently are made through direct income withholding actions, whereby an out-of-state IV-D agency sends direct notice to an employer in the obligor's state to withhold funds to satisfy the support obligation. Nonetheless, this section remains viable for those situation in which the direct withholding encounters a glitch. Further, there are ongoing problems in states not having income withholding payments go to the state disbursement unit. This section is intended to solve the problem by directing the payments to the most logical disbursement unit, i.e., the state with continuing exclusive jurisdiction.

      This article authorizes a "pure" parentage action in the interstate context, i.e., an action not joined with a claim for support. The mother, an alleged father of a child, or a support enforcement agency may bring such an action. Typically an action to determine parentage across a state line or international border will also seek to establish a support order.

      Section 401. An action to establish parentage under UIFSA is to be treated identically to such an action brought in the responding state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a departure from the rest of this act, in UIFSA (2001) the term "tribunal" was replaced by "court" in this section. The several states have a variety of combinations of judicial or administrative entities that are authorized to establish, enforce, and modify a child-support order. Because the Uniform Parentage Act (UPA) (2000) § 104 restricts parentage determinations to "a court,"
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      UPA (2000) § 104, the drafters took the view that only a judicial officer should determine parentage as a matter of public policy. This conclusion was in error insofar as some states are concerned and is reversed in this iteration of the act.

      INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This article governs direct filing of an income withholding order from one state to an employer in another state. Except as provided in Section 507, the provisions of this article only apply to an interstate case and do not apply to an income-withholding order from a foreign country. While U.S. employers routinely enforce sister state income- withholding orders, enforcement of the wide variety of possible foreign support orders would provide too many complexities and challenges to justify requiring an employer to interpret and enforce an ostensible foreign income-withholding order. Indeed, income- withholding orders from a foreign country are quite rare at this time, although instances of that enforcement remedy probably will increase in the future.

     <p>
      In 1984 Congress mandated that all states adopt procedures for enforcing income-withholding orders of sister states. Direct recognition by the out-of-state obligor's employer of a withholding order issued by another state long was sought by support enforcement associations and other advocacy groups. UIFSA (1992) recognized such a procedure. This article was extensively amended in 1996, but was the subject only of clarifying amendments in 2001.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 501 is deliberately written in the passive voice; the act does not restrict those who may send an income-withholding order across state lines. Although the sender will ordinarily be a child support enforcement agency or the obligee, the obligor or any other person may supply an employer with the income-withholding order. "Sending a copy" of a withholding order to an employer is clearly distinguishable from "service" of that order on the same employer. Service of an order necessarily intends to invoke a tribunal's authority over an employer doing business in the state. Thus, for there to be valid "service" of a withholding order on an employer in a state, the tribunal must have authority to bind the employer. In most cases, this requires the assertion of the authority of a local responding tribunal in a "registration for enforcement" proceeding. In short, the formality of "service" defeats the whole purpose of direct income withholding across state lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      The process contemplated in this article is direct "notification" of an employer in another state of a withholding order without the involvement of initiating or responding tribunals. Therefore, receipt of a copy of a withholding order by facsimile, regular first class mail, registered or certified mail, or any other type of direct notice is sufficient to provide the requisite notice to trigger direct income withholding in the absence of a contest by the employee-obligor. This process is now widely used by not only child support enforcement agencies, but also by private collection agencies or private attorneys acting on behalf of obligees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as provided in Section 507, Administrative Enforcement of Orders, none of the sections in Article 5 are intended to apply to foreign support orders. While it is appropriate for U.S. employers to enforce sister state income-withholding orders routinely, enforcement of the wide variety of possible foreign support orders provides too many complexities and challenges to require an employer to interpret and enforce ostensible foreign income-withholding orders.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In 1996 major employers and national payroll associations urged NCCUSL to supply more detail regarding the rights and duties of an employer on receipt of an income-withholding order from another state. The Conference obliged with amendments to UIFSA establishing a series of steps for employers to follow.
     </p>
     <p>
      When an employer receives an income withholding order from another state, the first step is to notify the employee that an income withholding order has been received naming the employee as the obligor of child support, and that income withholding will begin within the time frame specified by local law. In other words, the employer will initially proceed just as if the withholding order had been received from a tribunal of the employer's state. It is the responsibility of the employee to take whatever protective measures are necessary to prevent the withholding if the employee asserts a defense as provided in Section 506,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      At this point neither an initiating nor a responding tribunal is directly involved. The withholding order may have been forwarded by the obligee, the obligee's attorney, or the out-of-state IV-D agency. In fact, there is no prohibition against anyone sending a valid copy of an income-withholding order, even a stranger to the litigation, such as the child's grandparent. Subsection (a) does not specify the method for sending this relatively informal notice for direct income withholding, but rather makes the assumption that the employer's communication to the employee regarding receipt of the order will cause an employee-obligor to act to prevent a wrongful invasion of his or her income if it is not owed as current child support or arrears.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) directs an employer of the enacting state to recognize a withholding order of a sister state, subject to the employee's right to contest the validity of the order or its enforcement. Prior to the promulgation of UIFSA, agencies in several states adopted a procedure of sending direct withholding requests to out-of-state employers. A contemporaneous study by the federal General Accounting Office reported that employers in a second state routinely recognized withholding orders of sister states despite an apparent lack of statutory authority to do so. UIFSA marked the first official sanction of this practice. Subsection (b) does not define "regular on its face," but the term should be liberally construed,
      <i>
       see U.S. v. Morton
      </i>
      , 467 U.S. 822 (1984) ("legal process regular on its face"). The rules governing intrastate procedure and defenses for withholding orders will apply to interstate orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) answered employers' complaints that insufficient direction for action was given by the original UIFSA. Prior to the 1996 amendments an employer was merely told to "distribute the funds as directed in the withholding order." This section clarifies the terms of the out-of-state order with which the employer must strictly comply. As a general principle, an employer is directed to comply with the specific terms contained in the order, but there are exceptions. Moreover, many income-withholding orders received at that time did not provide the detail necessary for the employer to comply with every directive. Since then, however, the long-anticipated federal forms were promulgated throughout 1997 and 1998, with periodic updates to the present time. Most recently, the text of income withholding orders for child support is fast conforming to a nationwide norm. To the extent that an order is silent, the employer is not required to respond to unstated demands of the issuing tribunal. Formerly, employers often were so concerned about ambiguous or incomplete orders that they telephoned child support enforcement agencies in other states to attempt to understand and comply with unstated terms. Employers should not be expected to become investigators or shoulder the responsibility of learning the law of 50 states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c)(1) directs that the amount and duration of periodic payments of current child support must be stated in a sum certain in order to elicit compliance. The amount of current support and duration of the support obligation are fixed by the controlling order and should be stated in the withholding order so that the employer is informed of the date on which the withholding is anticipated to terminate. The "sum certain" requirement is crucial to facilitating the employer's compliance. For example, an order for a "percentage of the obligor's net income," does not satisfy this requirement and is not entitled to compliance from an employer receiving an interstate income-withholding order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c)(2) states the obvious: information necessary for compliance must be clearly stated. For example, the destination of the payments must correspond to the destination originally designated or subsequently authorized by the issuing tribunal, such as by the redirection of payments pursuant to Section 319,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c)(3) provides that medical support for the child must be stated either by a periodic cash payment or, alternatively, by an order directing the employee-obligor to provide health insurance coverage from his employment. In the absence of an order for payment of a sum certain, issuance of an order for medical support as child support is required to ensure the employer enrolls the obligor's child for coverage if medical insurance is available through the obligor's employment. Failure to enroll the child should elicit, at the least, registration of an order for enforcement in the responding state, to be implemented by an order of a tribunal directing either the employee or the employer to comply to furnish insurance coverage for the child. If the employer is so directed by a medical support order, enrollment of the child in the health care plan at the employee-obligor's expense is not dependent on the obligor's consent, any more than withholding a sum certain from the obligor's income is subject to a veto. It is up to the employee-obligor to assert any defense to prevent the employer from abiding by the medical support order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c)(4) identifies certain costs and fees incurred in conjunction with the support enforcement that may be added to the withholding order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c)(5) requires that the amount of periodic payments for arrears and interest on arrears also must be stated as a sum certain. If the one-order system is to function properly, the issuing tribunal ultimately must be responsible to account for payments and maintain the record of arrears and interest rate on arrears. Full compliance with the support order will only be achieved when the issuing tribunal determines that the obligation no longer exists. The amount of periodic payments for arrears is also fixed by the controlling order unless the law of the issuing state or the state where the order is being enforced provides a procedure for redetermination of the amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) identifies those narrow provisions in which the law of the employee's work state applies, rather than the law of the issuing state. A large employer will almost certainly have a number of employees subject to income-withholding orders. From the employer's perspective, the procedural requirements for compliance should be uniform for all of those employees. Certain issues should be matters for the law of the employee's work state, such as the employer's fee for processing, the maximum amount to be withheld, and the time in which to comply. The latter necessarily includes the frequency with which income withholding must occur. This is also consistent with regard to the tax consideration imposed by choice of law considerations. The only element in the list of local laws identified in subsection (d) which stirred any controversy whatsoever was the fact that the maximum amount permitted to be withheld is to be subject to the law of the employee's work state. Demands of equal treatment for all obligees, plus the practical concern that large employers require uniform computer programming mandate this solution.

      This section incorporates into the interstate context the local law regarding defenses an employee-obligor may raise to an income-withholding order. Generally, states have accepted the IV-D requirement that the only viable defense is a mistake of fact, 42 U.S.C. § 666(b)(4)(A). This apparently includes errors in the amount of current support owed, in the amount of accrued arrearage, or mistaken identity of the alleged obligor. Other grounds are excluded, such as inappropriate amount of support ordered, changed financial circumstances of the obligor, or lack of visitation. H.R. Rep. No. 98-527, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1983). The latter claims must be pursued in a separate proceeding in the appropriate state, not in a UIFSA proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      This procedure is based on the assumption that valid defenses to income withholding for child support are few and far between. Experience has shown that in relatively few cases does an employee-obligor have a complete defense, e.g., the child has died, another contingency ending the support has occurred, the order has been superseded, or there is a case of mistaken identity and the employee is not the obligor. An employee's complaint that "The child support is too high" must be ignored.
     </p>
     <p>
      As noted frequently above, instances of multiple orders have become increasingly rare over the past two decades plus. Situations do arise, however, in which an employer has received multiple withholding notices regarding the obligor-employee and the same obligee. The notices may even allege conflicting amounts due, especially for payments on arrears. Additionally, many employees claim to have only learned of default orders when the withholding notice is delivered to the employer. This claim often is based on an assertion that the order being enforced through income withholding was entered without personal jurisdiction over the obligor-employee. A variety of similar fundamental defenses may be asserted, such as mistaken identity, full payment, another order controlling, etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) provides for a simple, efficient, and cost-effective method for an employee-alleged obligor to assert a defense. For example, if the existence of a support obligation is acknowledged but the details are at issue, the obligor may register the underlying "controlling" support order with a local tribunal and seek temporary protection pending resolution of the contest. This may be accomplished pro se, employment of private counsel, or by a request for services from the child support enforcement agency of the responding state. Some states provide administrative procedures for challenging the income withholding that may provide quicker resolution of a dispute than a judicially-based registration and hearing process. In the absence of expeditious action by the employee to assert a defense and contest the direct filing of a notice for withholding, however, the employer must begin income withholding in a timely fashion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another issue the employee-obligor may raise is that the withholding order received by the employer is not based on the controlling child-support order issued by the tribunal with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Section 207,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      . Such a claim does not constitute a defense to the obligation of child support, but does put at issue the identity of the order to which the employer must respond.
     </p>
     <p>
      The one order system initiated by UIFSA effectively has eliminated the multiple-order system of RURESA, which primarily involved multiple orders by different courts for the same child. At present most "duplicate income withholding orders" involve one state seeking state assigned arrears and another state also seeking arrears, and possibly ongoing support as well. Clearly the employer is in no position to make a decision on how to proceed to resolve such conflicting claims. When multiple orders involve the same employee-obligor and child, or multiple children (including those with other mothers), as a practical matter resort to a responding tribunal to resolve the resulting dispute almost certainly will be necessary.

     </p>
     <p>
      Sections 501 through 506 are posited on the belief that U.S. employers ought not be burdened with enforcement of foreign income-withholding orders received directly from overseas. This view is inapplicable if a support enforcement agency is involved. The procedural safeguards built into the Title IV-D system of processing requests between Central Authorities provide reasonable assurance that the income withholding order to be enforced is genuine.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section authorizes summary enforcement of an interstate or foreign child-support order through the administrative means available for intrastate orders if the agency deems it "appropriate" to do so. Under subsection (a), an interested party in another state or foreign country, which necessarily includes a private attorney or a support enforcement agency, may forward a support order or income-withholding order to a support enforcement agency of the responding state. The term "responding state" in this context does not necessarily contemplate resort to a tribunal as an initial step.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) directs the support enforcement agency in the responding state to consider and, if appropriate, to use that state's regular administrative procedures to process an out-of-state order. Thus, a local employer accustomed to dealing with the local agency need not change its procedure to comply with an out-of-state order. Similarly, the administrative agency is authorized to apply its ordinary rules equally to both intrastate and interstate orders. For example, if the administrative hearing procedure must be exhausted for an intrastate order before a contesting party may seek relief in a tribunal, the same rule applies to an interstate order received for administrative enforcement. This subsection also makes it clear that filing liens or submitting claims in legal actions do not require the initial registration of the order.

      INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 601 through 604 establish the basic procedure for the registration of a support order from another state or a foreign support order. Under RURESA when a tribunal of a responding state was requested to register and enforce an existing child-support order, the common practice was to ignore the request; rather, a separate proceeding would be initiated for the establishment of a new support order. This practice was specifically rejected by UIFSA; this practice under RURESA created the multiple support-order system that UIFSA was specifically designed to eliminate. Under Sections 205 through 207 the one-order system allows only one existing order to be enforced prospectively.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 605 through 608 provide the procedure for the nonregistering party to contest registration of an order, either because the order is allegedly invalid, superseded, or no longer in effect, or because the enforcement remedy being sought is opposed by the nonregistering party. Other enforcement remedies may be available without resort to the UIFSA process under the law of the responding state.
     <i>
      See
     </i>
     Section 104.
    </p>
    <p>
     The registration and enforcement provisions in Sections 601 through 608 are consistent with the "recognition and enforcement" provisions of the Convention. The terms of this article and Article 7 suffice to direct international support orders into the proper channels.

     </p>
     <p>
      Registration of an order in a tribunal of the responding state is the first step to enforce a support order from another state or foreign country. If a prior support order has been validly issued by a tribunal with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Section 205, such an order is to be prospectively enforced against the obligor in the absence of narrow, strictly defined fact situations in which an existing order may be modified.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Sections 609 through 614. Until and unless that order is modified, however, it remains an order of the issuing tribunal and is fully enforceable in the responding state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although registration that is not accompanied by a request for the affirmative relief of enforcement is not prohibited, the act does not contemplate registration as serving a purpose in itself. In that regard, registration is a process, and the failure to register does not deprive an otherwise appropriate forum of subject matter jurisdiction. Note that either or both a state support order or a state income-withholding order may be registered. However, although a foreign support order also may be registered, this section does not contemplate recognition of a foreign income-withholding order.

     <p>
      Subsection (a) outlines the mechanics for registration of an interstate or foreign support order. Substantial compliance with the requirements is expected. The procedure for registration and enforcement set forth in this section is basically unchanged for a foreign support order; indeed, all of Sections 601 through 608 apply. The requirement that the order be "issued by a tribunal" has been subtly modified. Although the vast majority of enforceable support orders will be from a tribunal, in relatively rare instances an enforceable "foreign support order" from a Convention country will not have been issued by a tribunal,
      <i>
       see e.g.
      </i>
      , Section 710,
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      . Note, however, that a request for registration of a foreign support order for which the Convention is in force is subject to Section 706. This is because the list of documents comprising the required record in subsection (a) differs in a measurable degree with Convention art. 11 and 25.
     </p>
     <p>
      Millions of interstate domestic cases have been, and will continue to be, processed under the procedure specified in this section. It has been estimated that only approximately one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) of the Title IV-D caseload involve a foreign support order. Thus, the documentation specified by this section is the same for interstate and non-Convention foreign support orders. A support order from a Convention country is covered by the separate list of specifications in Section 706 to accommodate the differences between this act and the Convention. Because child-support enforcement agencies have successfully dealt with foreign support orders with increasing frequency during the UIFSA era, this may well prove to be a distinction without much difference.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) confirms that the support order being registered is not converted into an order of the responding state; rather, it continues to be an order of the tribunal of the issuing state or foreign country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) warns that if a particular enforcement remedy must be specifically sought under local law, the same rules of procedure and substantive law apply to an interstate or international case. For example, if license suspension or revocation is sought as a remedy for alleged noncompliance with an order, the substantive and procedural rules of the responding state apply. Whether the range of application of the remedy in the responding state is wider or narrower than that available in the issuing state or foreign country is irrelevant. The responding tribunal will apply the familiar law of its state, and is neither expected nor authorized to consider the enforcement laws of the issuing state or foreign country. In short, the responding tribunal follows the identical path for enforcing the order of a tribunal of another state or foreign country as it would when enforcing an order of the responding state. The authorization of a later filing to comply with local law contemplates that interstate or international pleadings may be liberally amended to conform to local practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (d) and (e) amplify the procedures to be followed when two or more child-support orders exist and registration for enforcement is sought. In such instances, the requester is directed to furnish the tribunal with sufficient information and documentation so that the tribunal may make a determination of the controlling order for prospective support and of the amount of consolidated arrears and interest accrued under all valid orders.

       COMMENT

     </p>
     <p>
      Initially the text of the registration procedure under UIFSA (1992) was nearly identical to that set forth in RURESA. But, the intent of UIFSA registration was always radically different. Under UIFSA, registration of a support order of State A continues to be an order of that state, which is to be enforced by a tribunal of State B. The ordinary rules of evidence and procedure of State B apply to hearings, except as local law may be supplemented or specifically superseded by other local law, i.e., UIFSA. The purpose of the registration procedure in sections 601 through 604 is that the order being registered remains a State A order until modified.
     </p>
     <p>
      First, note that subsection (a) is phrased in the passive voice; "A support order . . . is registered when the order is filed in the registering tribunal . . . ." This drafting is deliberate. By indirection, in effect UIFSA provides that either the obligor, the obligee, or a support enforcement agency, may register a support order of another state or a foreign support order. In fact, even a stranger to the litigation, for example a grandparent or an employer of an alleged obligor, may register a support order. Presumptively, the order registered is the valid, controlling order. If not, the act depends on the respondent to contest the registration.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Sections 605 through 608.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) provides that a support order of another state or a foreign support order is to be enforced and satisfied in the same manner as if it had been issued by a tribunal of the registering state. Conceptually, the responding tribunal is enforcing the order of a tribunal of another state or a foreign support order, not its own order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) mandates enforcement of the registered order, but forbids modification unless the terms of Sections 609 through 614 are met. Under UIFSA there will be only one order in existence at any one time. That order is enforceable in a responding state irrespective of whether the order may be modified. In most instances, a child-support order will be subject to the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the issuing tribunal. Sometimes the issuing tribunal will not be able to exercise its authority to modify the order because neither the child nor the parties reside in the issuing state. Nonetheless, the order may be registered and is fully enforceable in a responding state until the potential for modification actually occurs in accordance with the strict terms for such a proceeding.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 611. Thus, the registering tribunal always must bear in mind that the enforcement procedures taken, whether to enforce current support or to assist collecting current and future arrears and interest, are made on behalf of the issuing tribunal, and are not a modification of the controlling order.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) is intended to clarify the wide range of subjects that are governed by the choice-of-law rules established in this section. The task is to identify those aspects of the case for which local law is inapplicable. A basic principle of UIFSA is that throughout the process the controlling order remains the order of the tribunal of the issuing state or foreign country until a valid modification. The responding tribunal only assists in the enforcement of that order. Absent a loss of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction by the issuing tribunal and a subsequent modification of the order, the order never becomes an order of a responding tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) first identifies those aspects of the initial child-support order that are governed by the term's original decision and the function of the issuing tribunal. First and foremost, ultimate responsibility for enforcement and final resolution of the obligor's compliance with all aspects of the support order belongs to the issuing tribunal. Thus, calculation of whether the obligor has fully complied with the payment of current support, arrears, and interest on arrears is also the duty of the issuing tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      In UIFSA (1992) the decision was made by NCCUSL that the duration of child support should be fixed by the initial controlling child-support order.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 611(c). This policy decision was somewhat controversial at the time, especially given the general rule that "local law controls." But, case law regarding issues created by movement from one state with one duration to a state with another policy was hopelessly muddled, so a solution was sought. Then, as now, the policies of states on this subject varied greatly: today, a few states continue to set the once most-common age of 21 as the cut-off date; some continue the obligation past 21, dependent on enrollment in higher education (often with limited time specified); at the other end of the spectrum, some states end the obligation of child support at age 18; in others at 19; and, most popularly, at one or the other of either age 18 or 19, plus graduation from high school, whichever is later.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under subsection (a), if the initial issuing tribunal sets the age for termination of child support at 18, a responding state must recognize and enforce that child-support order. If the responding state sets its child support to age 21, the responding tribunal may not apply that time duration to require additional support to that age. The converse is also true. If the controlling order of another state ends the support obligation at 21, the responding tribunal in a state with 18 as the maximum duration for child support must enforce the controlling order until age 21. The dissent on this policy decision in UIFSA has abated over time. Interestingly, the Convention establishes age 21 as the hallmark. At the same time, under Convention art. 2(2), a country may reserve the right to limit the application of the Convention with regard to child support to persons who have not reached the age of 18. The United States does not intend to make such a reservation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, subsection (a) directs that the law of the issuing state or foreign country governs the answer to questions such as whether a payment made for the benefit of a child, such as a Social Security benefit for a child of a disabled obligor, should be credited against the obligor's child support obligation. In sum, on these subjects the consistent rule is that a controlling order from State A is enforced in State B (and State C as well).
     </p>
     <p>
      Note that as soon as a general proposition is identified, an exception may well be presented. Subsection (b) contains a choice-of-law provision that often diverges from other local law. In situations in which the statutes of limitation differ from state to state, the statute with the longer term is to be applied. In interstate cases, arrearages often will have accumulated over a considerable period of time before enforcement is perfected. The rationale for this exception to the general rule of "local law applies" is that the obligor should not gain an undue benefit from his or her choice of residence if the forum state, as the obligor's state of residence, has a shorter statute of limitations for arrearages than does the controlling order state. On the other side of the coin, i.e., if the forum has a longer statute of limitations, the obligor will be treated in an identical manner as all other obligors in that state. This choice of limitations also applies to the time period after the accrual of the arrears in which to bring an enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) mandates that local law controls with regard to enforcement procedures. For example, if the issuing state or foreign country has enacted a wide variety of license suspension or revocation statutes, while the responding state has a much narrower list of licenses subject to suspension or revocation, local law prevails.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) may initially appear only to express a truism the law of the issuing state is superior with regard to the terms of the support order. The last clause in the sentence, however, contains an important clarifying provision; that is, the law of the issuing state or foreign country is to be applied to the consolidated arrears, most particularly to the interest to be charged prospectively, even if the support orders of other states contributed a portion to those arrears. In sum, the local tribunal applies its own familiar procedures to enforce a support order, but it is clearly enforcing an order of a tribunal of another state and not an order of the forum.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) requires the registering tribunal to provide notice to the nonregistering party of the effect of registration. After such notice is given, absent a successful contest by the nonregistering party, the order will be confirmed and future contest will be precluded. The notice contemplates far more than merely announcing an intent to initiate enforcement of an existing support order. The registered order or orders and other relevant documents and information must accompany the notice, including details about the alleged arrears.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) provides the nonregistering party with a wealth of information about the proceeding, including that: (1) the order is immediately enforceable; (2) a hearing must be requested within a relatively short time; (3) failure to contest "will result" in a confirmation of the order (roughly the equivalent of a default judgment); and (4) the amount of arrears, if any. Initially subsection (b) made the suggestion, via brackets, that [20] days be the time within which a request for a hearing to contest the support order be made. The rationale for this relatively short period was that the matter had already been litigated, and the obligor had already had the requisite "day in court," and was allegedly in default of a known order. Moreover, advocates of child-support enforcement stressed the necessity of quick resolution of an instance of nonsupport.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, the Convention requires notice of hearing to be within a fixed time of 30 days, and further a fixed time of 60 days if the respondent resides in a foreign country. See Convention art. 23(6). This difference between UIFSA and the Convention is accommodated in Section 707. The time frame for notice of registration for an interstate support order and a foreign support order not subject to the Convention will be established by local law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) is the correlative to Section 602 regarding the notice to be given to the nonregistering party if determination of a controlling order must be made because of the existence of two or more child-support orders. The petitioner requesting this affirmative relief is directed to identify the order alleged to be controlling under Section 207.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) states the obvious; i.e., the obligor's employer also must be notified if income is to be withheld. Often this will not be necessary if the employer has already been notified by the responding state's enforcement agency via the administrative process established in Section 507.

       COMMENT

     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) directs the "nonregistering party" to contest the registration of an interstate support order or a foreign support order not subject to the Convention within a short period of time or forfeit the opportunity to contest. As noted in Section 605, that time frame is extended for cases subject to the Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of registration is the first step for enforcement or modification of another state's child-support order. Once the nonregistering party is put on notice of the registration, if an error allegedly has been made, the second step is crucial. The nonregistering party is required to assert any existing defense to the alleged controlling order, or forfeit the opportunity to contest the allegations. Note that either the obligor or the obligee may have objections to the registered order, although in the vast majority of cases the obligor is the nonregistering party.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, there is a possibility that in multiple-order situations either party may register the order most favorable to that party rather than register the likely controlling order, thus triggering a contest. Deliberately furnishing misinformation regarding the controlling order doubtless constitutes chicanery, which is contrary to Section 605(c). When a support enforcement agency requests registration, Section 307(c) requires reasonable efforts to ensure registration of the proper controlling order. Nonetheless, there may be an honest difference of opinion as to which order controls. The nonregistering obligor has a significant stake in assuring that both the order and the arrears are correctly stated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under UIFSA a contest of the fundamental provisions of the registered order is not permitted in the responding state. The nonregistering party must return to the issuing state or foreign country to prosecute such a contest (only as the law of that state or foreign country permits). This approach is akin to the prohibition found in Section 315 against asserting a nonparentage defense in a UIFSA proceeding. There is no attempt by UIFSA to preclude a collateral attack on the support order from being litigated in the appropriate forum.

      Subsection (b) precludes an untimely contest of a registered support order.

     <p>
      Subsection (a) places the burden on the nonregistering party to assert narrowly defined defenses to registration of a support order. The first of the listed defenses, lack of personal jurisdiction over the nonregistering party in the original proceeding, is undoubtedly the most widely discussed topic. It appears that at the appellate level, several of the other listed defenses are more commonly asserted. The decision in Kulko v. Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84 (1978) was somewhat controversial when delivered, and has remained so, at least in the international context. As a practical matter, however, the requirement that a support order be based on personal jurisdiction over both parties but primarily the obligor is a well-established fixture in the jurisprudence of the United States; relatively few appellate cases on this subject have been reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      A nonregistering obligor may assert a wide variety of listed defenses, such as "payment" or "the obligation has terminated," in response to allegations of noncompliance with the registered order. There is no defense, however, to registration of a valid foreign support order. The nonregistering party also may contest the allegedly controlling order because its terms have been modified. Or, the defense may be based on the existence of a different controlling order.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 207. Presumably this defense must be substantiated by registration of the alleged controlling order to be effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      While subsection (a)(6) is couched in terms that imply the defense to the amount of alleged arrears can only be that they are less, the converse is also available. For example, if the registering party is the obligor and asserts an amount of arrears that the obligee believes is too low, as the nonregistering party the obligee must contest to preclude confirmation of the alleged amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the absence of a valid defense, if the obligor is found to be liable for current support, the registering tribunal must enter an order to enforce that obligation. Additional proof of arrearages must also result in enforcement under the Bradley Amendment, 42 U.S.C. Section 666(a)(10), which requires all states to treat child-support payments as final judgments as they come due (or lose federal funding). Therefore, federal law precludes arrearages from being subject to retroactive modification. Future modification of a child support order from another state is governed by Sections 609-614, and Sections 615-616 regulate modification of foreign child support orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) provides that failure to contest a registered order successfully requires the tribunal to confirm the validity of the registered order.

     </p>
     <p>
      If, after notice, the nonregistering party fails to contest, the registered support order is confirmed by operation of law and no further action by a responding tribunal is necessary. Although the statute is not explicit on the subject, it seems likely in the absence of a contest both the registering and nonregistering party would be estopped from subsequently collaterally attacking the confirmed order, whether on the basis that "the wrong order was registered" or otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      If contested, a registered support order must be confirmed by the responding tribunal if, after a hearing, the defenses authorized in Section 607 are rejected. Thus, either scenario precludes the nonregistering party from raising any issue that could have been asserted in a hearing. Confirmation of a support order, whether by action or as the result of inaction, validates both the terms of the order and the asserted arrearages.

      INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Authority to modify a child-support order of another state depends on the interaction of these sections with the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the issuing tribunal.
     <i>
      See
     </i>
     Sections 205 through 206. This also might involve the determination of the controlling order in a situation involving multiple child-support orders. These concepts are not present in the international context.
     <i>
      See
     </i>
     Sections 615, 616, and 711. Thus, modification of a support order from a foreign country other than a Convention country is not governed by Sections 609-614, but is subject to Sections 615-616,
     <i>
      infra
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 609 through 614 apply only to modification of an interstate child-support order. Most of the act applies to "a support order," which includes both child-support and spousal support. Both categories are generally subject to interstate enforcement under UIFSA. But, as a practical matter, the actual process of that enforcement is quite different. Child support is enforced almost exclusively by governmentally sponsored Title IV-D agencies, which also may enforce spousal support if it is included in the same order. In some states, local funds are appropriated for enforcement of spousal support as well. Only occasionally will a private attorney be involved in a child-support case, but spousal support not issued in conjunction with a child-support order generally requires representation pro se or by private counsel. More importantly, a tribunal of a responding state may enforce spousal support, but it does not have authority to modify a spousal-support order of another state or foreign country unless the law of that jurisdiction does not assert continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its order.

     <p>
      Sections 609 through 614 deal with situations in which it is permissible for a registering state to modify the existing child-support order of another state. The first step for modification of another state's child-support order is registration in the responding tribunal under Sections 601 to 604. In some situations, this may also involve identification of the controlling order. A petitioner wishing to register a support order of another state for purposes of modification must conform to the general requirements for pleadings in Section 311, and follow the procedure for registration set forth in Section 602. If the tribunal has the requisite personal jurisdiction over the parties and may assume subject matter jurisdiction as provided in Sections 611 or 613, modification may be sought independently, in conjunction with registration and enforcement, or at a later date after the order has been registered and enforced if circumstances have changed.

       The Play-away Rule.
      </b>
      As long as the issuing tribunal has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its child-support order, a responding tribunal is precluded from modifying the controlling order.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Sections 205 through 207. UIFSA (1992) made critical choices regarding modification of an existing child-support order. First, the "one-order" rule was to be paramount. Second, the issuing tribunal had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order as long as a party or the child continued to reside in the issuing state. The original order remained in force as the controlling order until modified by another tribunal. Third, a separate procedure was created for modification of an existing child-support order when all parties and the child moved from the issuing state and acquired new residences. The key was that the movant seeking modification be "a nonresident of this state." The deciding factor, determined after extended debate, centered on curbing or eliminating the undesirable effect of "ambush or tag" jurisdiction, e.g., the likelihood that the parties would vie to strike first to obtain a home-town advantage. Although constitutional under Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604 (1990), such lawsuits would discourage continued contact between the child and the obligor, or between the parties for fear of a lawsuit in a distant forum. Thus, the goal was to avoid the situation in which modification would be available in a forum having personal jurisdiction over both parties based solely on the ground that service of process was made in the would-be forum state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under subsection (a)(1), before a responding tribunal may modify the existing controlling order, three specific criteria must be satisfied. First, the individual parties and the child must no longer reside in the issuing state. Second, the party seeking modification, usually the obligee, must register the order as a nonresident of the forum. That forum is almost always the state of residence of the other party, usually the obligor. A colloquial (but easily understood) description is that the nonresident movant for modification must "play an away game on the other party's home field." Third, the forum must have personal jurisdiction over the parties. By registering the support order, the movant submits to the personal jurisdiction of the forum through seeking affirmative relief. On rare occasion, personal jurisdiction over the respondent may be supplied by long-arm jurisdiction.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 201.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underlying policies of this procedure contemplate that the issuing tribunal no longer has an interest in exercising its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order, nor information readily available to it to do so. The play-away rule achieves rough justice between the parties in the majority of cases by preventing ambush in a local tribunal. Moreover, it takes into account the factual realities of the situation. In the overwhelming majority of cases the movant is the obligee who is receiving legal assistance in the issuing and responding states from Title IV-D support enforcement agencies. Further, evidence about the obligor's ability to pay child support and enforcement of the support order is best accomplished in the obligor's state of residence.

      Fairness requires that an obligee seeking to modify the existing child-support order in the state of residence of the obligor will not be subject to a cross-motion to modify custody merely because the issuing tribunal has lost its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the support order. The same restriction applies to an obligor who moves to modify the support order in a state other than that of his or her residence.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are exceptions to the play-away rule. Under subsection (a)(2), the parties may agree that a particular forum may serve to modify the order, even if the issuing tribunal has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. Subsection (a)(2) also applies if the individual parties agree to submit the modification issue to a tribunal in the petitioner's state of residence. Implicit in this shift of jurisdiction is that the agreed tribunal has subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over at least one of the parties or the child, and that the other party submits to the personal jurisdiction of that forum. UIFSA does not contemplate that parties may agree to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal without a nexus to the parties or the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proof that neither individual party nor the child continues to reside in the issuing state is made directly in the responding tribunal. No purpose is served by requiring the movant to return to the original issuing tribunal for a hearing to elicit confirmation of fact that none of the relevant persons still lives in the issuing state. Thus, the issuing tribunal is not called upon to transfer or surrender its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction or otherwise participate in the process, nor does it have discretion to refuse to yield jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a distinction between the processes involved under subsection (a). Once the requirements of subsection (a)(1) are met for assumption of jurisdiction, the responding tribunal acts on the modification and then notifies the issuing tribunal that the prior controlling order has been replaced by a new controlling order. In contrast, for another tribunal to assume modification jurisdiction by agreement under subsection (a)(2), the individual parties first must agree in a record to modification in the responding tribunal and file the record with the issuing tribunal. Thereafter they may proceed in the responding tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      A similar exception is found in Section 205(a)(2), which enables the parties to agree in a record of the original issuing tribunal that it may retain jurisdiction over the order even if all parties have left that state. Note that such an agreement can be incorporated in the initial order of the issuing tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 613 also is an exception to subsection (a)(1): it supplants the play-away rule if all parties have left the original issuing state and now reside in the same state, whether by chance or design.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) provides that when a responding tribunal assumes modification jurisdiction because the issuing tribunal has lost continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, the proceedings will generally follow local law with regard to modification of a child-support order, except as provided in subsections (c) and (d).
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Duration of the Child Support Obligation.
      </b>
      Prior to 1993 American case law was thoroughly in chaos over modification of the duration of a child-support obligation when an obligor or obligee moved from one state to another state and the states had different ages for the duration of child support. The existing duration usually was ignored by the issuance of a new order applying local law, which elicited a variety of appellate court opinions. UIFSA (1992) determined that a uniform rule should be proposed, to wit, duration of the child-support obligation would be fixed by the initial controlling order. Subsection (c) provides the original time frame for support is not modifiable unless the law of the issuing state provides for its modification. After UIFSA (1996) was universally enacted, some tribunals sought to subvert this policy by holding that completion of the obligation to support a child through age 18 established by a now-completed controlling order did not preclude the imposition of a new obligation to support the child through age 21, or beyond.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) prohibits imposition of multiple, albeit successive, support obligations. The initial controlling order may be modified and replaced by a new controlling order in accordance with the terms of Sections 609 through 614. But, the duration of the child support obligation remains constant, even though other aspects of the original order may be changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sometimes a domestic-violence protective order includes a provision for child support that will be in force for a specific time. The duration of the protective order often is less than the general law of the state for duration of the child-support obligation. Under these facts the general law of the issuing state regarding duration controls a subsequent child-support order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (e) provides that on modification the new child-support order becomes the controlling order to be recognized by all UIFSA states. Good practice mandates that the responding tribunal should explicitly state in its order that it is assuming responsibility for the controlling child-support order. Neither the parties nor other tribunals should be required to speculate about the effect of the action.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       International Effect.
      </b>
      Prohibiting modification based on the play-away principle in the international context is problematic. The issue arises because the United States is wedded to personal jurisdiction over the individual parties at a state level, rather than the child-based, national jurisdiction found virtually everywhere else. For example, a foreign country typically regards a support order to be of the country, not an order from a political subdivision, e.g., an order from Germany. In some important instances, however, a foreign support order is indeed made in a political subdivision, e.g., a support order from a Canadian province. Although consideration was given to labeling a support order issued in a state to be an order of the United States, conforming modification of child support to the general principles of state law through UIFSA is the only practical choice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) creates a necessary exception to the play-away concept when the parties and the child no longer reside in the issuing state and one party resides outside the United States. The play-away principle makes sense when the tribunals involved have identical laws regarding continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify a child-support order.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Sections 205 through 207. If one party resides in a foreign country, a pure play-away rule would deny modification in a forum subject to UIFSA rules to the party or child who has moved from the issuing state, but continues to reside in the United States. This result does not occur under Convention art.18, which places restrictions on modification of a support order in another Convention country if the obligee remains in the issuing Convention country. That article does not mention an effect when only the obligor remains in the issuing country, perhaps because the Convention makes clear that under a child-based system modification jurisdiction will follow the obligee and the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) identifies the tribunal that issued the controlling order as the logical choice for an available forum in which UIFSA will apply. This exception to the play-away rule provides assured personal jurisdiction over the parties, which in turn enables the issuing tribunal to retain continuing jurisdiction to modify its order. Of course, the party residing outside the United States has the option to pursue a modification in the state where the other party or child currently reside.
     </p>
     <p>
      In sum, under this section personal service on either the custodial or noncustodial party found within the state borders, by itself, does not yield jurisdiction to modify. A party seeking to exercise rights of visitation, delivering or picking-up the child for such visitation, or engaging in unrelated business activity in the state, will not be involuntarily subjected to protracted litigation in an inconvenient forum. The play-away rule avoids the possible chilling effect on the exercise of parental contact with the child that the possibility of such litigation might have. The vast majority of disputes about whether a tribunal has jurisdiction will be eliminated. Moreover, submission by the petitioner to the state of residence of the respondent obviates this issue. Finally, because there is an existing order, the primary focus will shift to enforcement, thereby curtailing unnecessary modification efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       UIFSA Relationship to UCCJEA.
      </b>
      Jurisdiction for modification of child support under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) is distinct from modification of custody under the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1738A, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) §§ 201 202. These acts provide that the court of exclusive, continuing jurisdiction may "decline jurisdiction." Declining jurisdiction, thereby creating a potential vacuum, is not authorized under UIFSA. Once a controlling child-support order is established under UIFSA, at all times thereafter there is an existing order in effect to be enforced. Even if the issuing tribunal no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, its order remains fully enforceable until a tribunal with modification jurisdiction issues a new order in conformance with this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      UIFSA and UCCJEA seek a world in which there is but one order at a time for child support and custody and visitation. Both have similar restrictions on the ability of a tribunal to modify the existing order. The major difference between the two acts is that the basic jurisdictional nexus of each is founded on different considerations. UIFSA has its focus on the personal jurisdiction necessary to bind the obligor to payment of a child-support order. UCCJEA places its focus on the factual circumstances of the child, primarily the "home state" of the child; personal jurisdiction to bind a party to the custody decree is not required. An example of the disparate consequences of this difference is the fact that a return to the decree state does not reestablish continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under the UCCJEA.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      UCCJEA § 202. Under similar facts UIFSA grants the issuing tribunal continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its child-support order if, at the time the proceeding is filed, the issuing tribunal "is the residence" of one of the individual parties or the child.

     <p>
      A key aspect of UIFSA is the deference to the controlling child-support order of a sister state demanded from a tribunal of the forum state. This applies not just to the original order, but also to a modified child-support order issued by a second state under the standards established by Sections 611and 613. For the act to function properly, the original issuing tribunal must recognize and accept the modified order as controlling, and must regard its prior order as prospectively inoperative. Because the UIFSA system is based on an interlocking series of state laws, it is fundamental that a modifying tribunal of one state lacks the authority to direct the original issuing tribunal to release its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. That result is accomplished through the enactment of UIFSA by all states, which empowers a modifying tribunal to assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction from the original issuing tribunal and requires an issuing tribunal to recognize such an assumption of jurisdiction. This explains why the U.S. Congress took the extraordinary measure in PRWORA of mandating universal passage of UIFSA (1996), as amended.

     <p>
      It is not unusual for the parties and the child subject to a child-support order to no longer reside in the issuing state, and for the individual parties to have moved to the same new state. The result is that the child-support order remains enforceable, but the issuing tribunal no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order. A tribunal of the state of mutual residence of the individual parties has jurisdiction to modify the child-support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. Although the individual parties must reside in the forum state, there is no requirement that the child must also reside in the forum state (although the child must have moved from the issuing state).
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, because modification of the child-support order when all parties reside in the forum is essentially an intrastate matter, subsection (b) withdraws authority to apply most of the substantive and procedural provisions of UIFSA, i.e., those found in the act other than in Articles 1, 2, and 6. Note the duration of the support obligation is a nonmodifiable aspect of the original controlling order,

      For the act to function properly, the prevailing party in a proceeding that modifies a controlling order must inform the original issuing tribunal about its loss of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its child-support order. Thereafter, the original tribunal may not modify, or review and adjust, the amount of child support. Notice to the issuing tribunal and other affected tribunals that the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the former controlling order has been modified is crucial to avoid the confusion and chaos of the multiple-order system UIFSA replaced.
     </p>

      The new issuing tribunal has authority to impose sanctions on a party who fails to comply with the requirement to give notice of a modification to all interested tribunals. Note, however, that failure to notify a displaced tribunal of the modification of its order does not affect the validity of the modified order.

      Subsection (a) provides that a state tribunal may modify a foreign child-support order, other than a Convention order, when the foreign issuing tribunal lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order. The standard example cited for the necessity of this special rule involved the conundrum posed when an obligor has moved to the responding state from the issuing country and the law of that country requires both parties to be physically present at a hearing before the tribunal in order to sustain a modification of child support. In that circumstance, the foreign issuing tribunal is unable to exercise jurisdiction to modify under its law. Ordinarily, under Section 611 the responding state tribunal is not authorized to issue a new order, in effect modifying the foreign support order, because the child or the obligee continues to reside in the issuing country. To remedy the perceived inequity in such a fact situation, this section provides an exception to the rule of Section 611. If both parties are subject to the personal jurisdiction of a state by the obligee's submission and the obligor's residence, or other grounds under Section 201, the responding state tribunal may modify the foreign child-support order. Modification of a Convention order is governed by Section 711.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ability of a state tribunal to modify when the foreign country refuses to exercise its jurisdiction should be invoked with circumspection, as there may be a cogent reason for such refusal. Note, Section 317 empowers tribunals to communicate regarding this issue, rather than rely upon representations of one or more of the parties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) states that if a new order is issued under subsection (a), it becomes the UIFSA controlling order insofar as other states are concerned. Obviously this act cannot dictate the same result to the issuing foreign tribunal, although it seems highly likely that either through child-based jurisdiction or an action filed by the obligee recognition by the foreign tribunal will occur.

      The procedure for registration and enforcement set forth in Sections 601 through 608 is applicable to a child-support order from a non-Convention country. This section provides coverage for modification in that situation. Presumptively, the general law of the state regarding modification of a child-support order will apply because, by their terms, Sections 609 through 614 apply only to modification of a child-support order by a state tribunal. The rationale is that modification is available because the foreign order is not founded on the UIFSA principles of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction and a controlling order.

      INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This article contains provisions adapted from the Convention that could not be readily integrated into the existing body of Articles 1 through 6. For the most part, extending the coverage of UIFSA (2008) to foreign countries was a satisfactory solution to merge the appropriate Convention terms into this act. In understanding this process, it must be clearly stated that the terms of the Convention are not substantive law.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Convention is a multilateral treaty which binds the United States and the other Convention countries to assure compliance. As such, it will be the law of the land; but the treaty is not self-executing.
     <i>
      See
     </i>
     , Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 128 S. Ct. 1346, 170 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2008). Thus, the ultimate enforcement of the treaty in the United States is dependent on the key implementing federal law and the enactment of both federal and state legislation which provide the mechanism for enforcing the requirements of the Convention. This act is predicated on the principle that the enactment of UIFSA (2008) in all States and federal jurisdictions will effectively implement the Convention through state law by amending Articles 1 through 6, plus the addition of this article. The treaty, in essence, establishes the framework for a system of international cooperation by emulating the interstate effect of UIFSA for international cases, especially those affected by the Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
     In relatively few instances, the provisions of the Convention are sufficiently specific that a choice was made between amending UIFSA accordingly, with a disproportionate effect on all support orders enforced under state law, or accommodating potential conflicts by creating a separate article to apply only to Convention support orders. The choice was to draft this article as state law to minimize disruption to interstate support orders, which constitute the vast majority of orders processed under UIFSA. Note that this act is the substantive and procedural state law for: (1) responding to an application for establishment, recognition and enforcement, or modification of a Convention support order; and, (2) initiating an application to a Convention country for similar action.
    </p>
    <p>
     The four Hague maintenance conventions that preceded the 2007 Convention, and the three prior versions of UIFSA, have common goals. The distinctions between the jurisdictional rules in the common-law tradition in the United States, and the civil law systems in most of the countries that were parties to the earlier maintenance conventions, were obstacles to participation of the United States in any of the multilateral maintenance treaties. As the world has grown smaller and globalization has become the order of the day, reconciling the differences has become more and more important. Understanding the necessity for accommodation has made the task easier. This is not to say easy, as evidenced by the fact that the formal negotiations leading to the final text of the Convention spanned from May, 2003, to November, 2007.
    </p>
    <p>
     The United States signed the Convention on November 23, 2007 and the Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification in 2010. Enabling federal legislation was enacted on September 29, 2014 which requires all states to enact UIFSA (2008) by the end of 2015. At that point the United States will deposit its instrument of ratification and the Convention will enter into force in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     UIFSA (2008) and the 2007 Convention have far more in common than did former uniform acts and maintenance conventions, and, in fact, many provisions of the Convention are modeled on UIFSA principles. The negotiations demonstrated that it is possible to draft an international convention, which incorporates core UIFSA principles into a system for the establishment and enforcement of child support and spousal-support orders across international borders, and creates an efficient, economical, and expeditious procedure to accomplish these goals. Matters in common, however, go far beyond identical goals. The negotiations provided an opportunity for an extended interchange of ideas about how to adapt legal mechanisms to facilitate child support enforcement between otherwise disparate legal systems.
    </p>
    <p>
     International cross-border enforcement has been far more important in Western Europe, and more recently, throughout the countries of the European Union than has been the case in the United States. On the other hand, experience with establishment and enforcement of interstate child-support orders in the United States has been building since 1950, and accelerated rapidly with enactment of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act in 1975. Clearly, the issues are far easier to deal with nationally because of the common language, currency, and legal system, and, since 1996, with the Title IV-D requirement that all states enact the same version of UIFSA. In fact, since the advent of UIFSA and Title IV-D, millions of interstate cases have been processed through the child support enforcement system and thousands of support orders from other countries have also been registered and enforced in the United States because UIFSA treated such orders as if they had been entered by one of the states. In the future, in Convention countries, this country's orders will be entitled to similar treatment. The entry into force of the Convention is designed to further improve the process and will most certainly lead in a few years to a substantial increase in international cases, both incoming and outgoing.
    </p>
    <p>
     To create UIFSA (2008), it was necessary to integrate the texts of UIFSA (2001) and the Convention. This did not present a significant drafting challenge for the most part. By far the most common amendment in Articles 1 through 6 is to substitute "state or foreign country" for the term "state." These simple amendments expanded a majority of this act to cover foreign support orders. In this article statutory directions are given to "a tribunal of this state," and also to a "governmental entity, individual petitioner, support enforcement agency, or a party."

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      A readily apparent difference between UIFSA (2008) and the Convention is the perceived need for definitions in the former, and the very limited number of definitions in the latter. This act contains twenty-nine definitions in Section 102, and an additional seven for this article. In contrast, the Convention contains only seven official definitions. Some of these are synonyms for definitions in UIFSA, i.e., "creditor and debtor" for "obligor and obligee," and "agreement in writing" for "record."
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (1), "application" refers to the process for an individual obligor or obligee to request assistance from a central authority under the Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (2) and (5) identify the governmental entities, i.e., central authority, in each contracting country or political subdivisions thereof, that will function as the operating agencies to facilitate contacts between Convention countries. The Convention is a treaty between the countries in which it is in force thus creating mutual obligations. The duties assigned in the Convention to the central authority of each country will be performed according to the choice of each country. It is crucial to recognize that in the United States it will be the Title IV-D agency of each state that will be designated by the U.S. central authority to perform most of the functions specified in the Convention. It appears likely that in many foreign countries the central authority will serve in the role of a clearinghouse, rather than as the operative enforcement entity, while some countries may assign all central authority functions to one agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (3), "Convention support order" narrows the term "foreign support order," as employed in Articles 1 through 6. The provisions in those articles also apply to Convention support orders, but when this act is not congruent with the Convention, support orders under the Convention are subject to this article. This article has no application to a support order from a non-Convention foreign country, as defined in Section 102(5)(A) and (B) or a support order entitled to comity, Section 102(5)(C), except to the extent that a Convention country may request enforcement of a non-Convention support order that has been recognized in the United States under some other procedure,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Section 704.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (4) integrates the "direct request" authorized by the Convention with the provisions for filing a petition in Articles 1 through 6.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition in the Convention for "maintenance arrangement" has been rephrased in Subsection (6), and must be read together with Section 710 to understand the process authorized in the Convention.

      The first sentence definitively states that this article applies only to a proceeding involving a Convention country, as defined in Section 102(5)(D). This article does not generally apply to a support order from a non-Convention foreign country as defined in Section 102(5)(A) and (B) or to a support order entitled to comity. The second sentence resolves a situation in which there is a conflict between a section in this article and a provision in Articles 1 through 6, in which case this article controls.

      The Secretary of Health and Human Services has designated the state Title IV-D child support agencies as the governmental entities that will carry out many of the central authority's functions under the Convention. Each state determines which public office or administrative agency will perform the Title IV-D services for child support enforcement. Because the federal government provides a significant subsidy for this effort, the actions of the agency must comply with federal statutes and regulations and the state legislature must enact certain mandatory laws. The relationship is symbiotic in that states choose to participate in the Title IV-D program, and do so by following their own state procedures and legislative enactments that recognize and authorize the state officer or agency to function under these conditions.

     <p>
      This section is designed to enable lawyers and non-lawyers to better understand proceedings under the Convention, which itself is written in terminology unfamiliar to legal proceedings in the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) lists the rights and duties of a support enforcement agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) lists what rights and duties are available to an obligee, whether the proceeding is inbound from a Convention country or outbound to a Convention country.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to the general rule in UIFSA, which attempts to maintain something of parity between the obligor and obligee, subsection (c) limits the rights and duties available to an obligor under the Convention. This reflects the equal treatment ideal espoused by UIFSA in Articles 1 through 6, and the pro-obligee philosophy of the Convention. In actual practice, the results may not be that different. Recall that until replaced by UIFSA, an informal subtitle given to URESA by its leading proponents was "The Runaway Pappy Act."

      Subsection (d) tracks Convention art. 14 (5).

      Given the long history of open courts in the United States, this section may seem axiomatic, redundant, or unnecessary. In fact, because this principle has not always been universal, it is important to recognize that the Convention confirms that an individual residing in a Convention country may file a petition directly in a tribunal of another Convention country without requesting the assistance of a central authority or a support enforcement agency. Given the variety of legal systems that may be involved under the Convention, this freedom of choice is explicitly protected. A person residing in a Convention county, whether a citizen or a noncitizen of the United States, may apply to a tribunal in the United States for establishment, recognition, and enforcement of a child-support order for enforcement of a spousal support order, for recognition and enforcement of a foreign support agreement, and in some situations, for modification of an existing support order. Of course, the freedom of an individual to petition for relief in a tribunal says nothing about the nature of legal representation, if any, implicit in the right of access to a tribunal, is that representation may be pro se or by private counsel.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 309.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) provides that an individual party may file a proceeding directly in a tribunal, thus submitting to the jurisdiction of the tribunal and to state law. The object of the proceeding may be establishment of a support order, determination of parentage of a child, or modification of an existing support order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) recognizes that an individual party may file a proceeding in a tribunal requesting recognition and enforcement of a Convention support order, or a foreign support agreement as defined in Section 710. The party thereby chooses not to seek the services of a central authority or support enforcement agency. Nonetheless, the individual will be affected indirectly by the terms of the Convention because the proceeding is subject to Sections 706 through 713, which are drawn from the Convention. This effect applies to an individual residing in a Convention country and to an individual residing elsewhere who is seeking to enforce a Convention support order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) contains two provisions drawn from the Convention specifically applicable to a petition for recognition and enforcement of a Convention support order. First, a guarantee of payment of costs may not be required. Second, if the individual has benefited from free legal assistance in a Convention country, that individual is entitled to free legal assistance if it is available in similar circumstances under the law of the responding state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under subsection (d) an individual party who files a direct request regarding a Convention support order in a tribunal is not entitled to assistance from the governmental entity, i.e. the support enforcement agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (e) echoes Article 52 of the Convention. An individual party who files a petition in a tribunal may take advantage of any "simplified, more expeditious procedures" which may be available in the requested state, so long as they are "compatible with the protection offered to the parties under articles 23 and 24" of the Convention.

     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) integrates the Convention support order into the registration for enforcement procedure set forth in Sections 601 through 608. A state support enforcement agency and a tribunal will use basically the same procedures for a Convention order under this article as would be used in a non-Convention proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      From inception, UIFSA contained detailed provisions for substantive procedures for interstate child- support orders. To facilitate expedited processing, detailed statutory instructions have encouraged uniformity of legal documents. The Convention follows this precedent. The list of documents to be provided, however, is somewhat different than the documents described in Sections 311 and 602. In order to ensure that a document satisfying the requirements of the Convention will be accepted by a support enforcement agency or tribunal, subsection (a) identifies the documents required to accompany an application under the Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several of the required documents may be unfamiliar in the United States, e.g., the authority to provide an abstract or an extract of an order rather than the complete text of an order under paragraph (b)(1); the requirement for a statement of enforceability of the order under paragraph (b)(2); proof that the respondent had proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard if the respondent did not appear and was not represented under (b)(3); and proof that the applicant received free legal assistance in the issuing country under paragraph (b)(6).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) provides that a petitioner may request only partial enforcement of a support order,
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Section 709.
      <i>
       infra
      </i>
      , which speaks to partial enforcement by a tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (d) and (e) authorize action by a tribunal available under the Convention that may not be available under other state law. Subsection (d) permits the tribunal to vacate registration, acting on its own motion, under certain exceptional circumstances, and subsection (e) requires that notice be promptly provided of any such order vacating registration. Such
      <i>
       ex officio
      </i>
      review, if used to refuse recognition of an order, is in tension with the core UIFSA policy of requiring recognition. In any event, the subsections are not a vehicle for a review of the merits of the decision. An example would be useful here, but there is none in the Explanatory Report to the Convention, just the negative reference that a country could not use this to enforce a policy against ordering support for a child born out of wedlock. http://www.hcch.net/upload/expl38.pdf. Perhaps an example could be that the court might reject an application to establish support from a biological parent whose rights had been terminated and the child was subsequently adopted.

      Subsection (a) states the general rule that a contest of a registration is generally governed by Sections 605 through 608,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      . Subsection (b), however, establishes separate, longer time frames to contest the registration of a Convention support order than for filing a contest as established in Section 605. If notice of contest is to be given in the United States, the time difference is relatively modest, i.e., 30 days instead of 20. A more significant difference is created for out-of-country notice, i.e., 60 days instead of 20. Arguably this takes into account that providing notice to a party in a foreign country may take longer than ordinarily expected. In any event, the longer time frames are specifically required in connection with a Convention order. Note that while the principle may always be true that notice to a party situated in a foreign country may take longer, the additional times for notice apply only to an order subject to the Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (c)-(g) transform Convention language into UIFSA terminology. Subsection (g), which prohibits a stay in enforcement pending a challenge or appeal except in exceptional circumstances, is another substantive provision required by the Convention. It does not apply in non-Convention cases, in which domestic law determines whether a stay of enforcement should be granted pending an appeal or other challenge.

       Enforceability; the general rule, with exceptions.
      </b>
      Subsection (a) states the general proposition that if a child-support order is issued by a tribunal in a Convention country, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the order shall be recognized and enforced. In domestic cases UIFSA requires recognition of child-support order of a sister state, 28 U.S.C.A. § 1738B, Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA). Receipt of a child-support order from a sister state is routinely processed and enforced. Critical examination of the sister state order for defects is not called for; it is the responsibility of the respondent to assert any defenses available. Moreover, experience has shown that child-support orders are generally valid, for relatively modest amounts, and seldom subject to claims of fraud. The most common defect is one of mistake, rather than deliberate misconduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) combines provisions from four separate articles in the Convention. These articles provide an extensive number of specific reasons for a tribunal or support enforcement agency of one Convention country to refuse to recognize a child-support order from another Convention country. For this act to be consistent with the Convention, it is necessary to identify the potential defects of a support order from a Convention country in which a defendant might raise a challenge based on lack of jurisdiction, due process, or enforceability of an order for arrearages. The majority of these defects arguably are self-explanatory, and almost all are subject to factual dispute to be resolved by the tribunal, to wit: (b)(1) "manifestly incompatible" with public policy, including violation of minimum standards of due process; (b)(2) issued without personal jurisdiction over the individual party
      <i>
       (discussed at length below)
      </i>
      ; (b)(3) unenforceable in the issuing country; (b)(4) obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure; (b)(5) the record lacks authenticity or integrity, e.g., forged; (b)(6) a prior proceeding is pending; (b)(7) a more recent support order is controlling; (b)(8) full or partial payment; (b)(9)(A),(B), no appearance, notice, or opportunity to be heard
      <i>
       (discussed below)
      </i>
      ; and, (b)(10) exceeds limitations and restraints on modification. As with domestic cases, the norm will be to recognize and enforce a foreign order absent a challenge by the respondent. Three provisions most likely to trigger a tribunal to refuse to recognize and enforce a foreign support order require more attention, i.e., subsections (b)(2), (4) and (9)(A), (B).
     </p>
     <p>
      Of particular note, subsection (c) applies to a refusal to recognize and enforce a Convention order under any of these grounds. From the perspective of the United States, subsection (b)(2) is likely to be the primary reason for a tribunal to refuse to recognize and enforce a registered Convention support order. Key to its participation in the negotiations leading to the Convention, the United States insisted that a support order may be refused recognition by a tribunal if the issuing foreign tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the respondent. The facts underlying the Convention support order must be measured by a tribunal as consistent with the long-arm jurisdictional provisions of UIFSA.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Sections 201-202. A potential problem occurs only if a Convention support order cannot be enforced by a tribunal because there was no appropriate nexus between the foreign country and the respondent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) provides that any of the reasons enumerated for not recognizing and enforcing a registered Convention support order, i.e., (b)(2), (4) and (9), will trigger the obligation of the tribunal not to dismiss the proceeding before allowing a reasonable time for a party to seek the establishment of a new child-support order. Moreover, if the Title IV-D support enforcement agency is involved, it must "take all appropriate measures to request a child-support order;" i.e., file a petition seeking to establish an initial child-support order by the tribunal. In that case, the tribunal shall treat the request for recognition and enforcement as a petition for establishment of a new order.

      <b>
       Two systems; direct and indirect jurisdiction.
      </b>
      In drafting the Convention, the subject of the requisite jurisdiction to issue a support order generated considerable discussion. The choice divided itself into two distinct categories; rules of direct and indirect jurisdiction. Direct jurisdiction provides explicit bases on which a tribunal is vested with the power to assert its authority and enter a support order.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Section 201.
     </p>
     <p>
      The UIFSA long-arm provisions are paradigm rules of direct jurisdiction. Section 201 identifies the bases on which a tribunal may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual, obligor or obligee, without regard to the current residence of the individual or child. As discussed in the comment to Section 201,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      , these long-arm jurisdictional rules for child support and spousal support orders were fashioned case-by-case by the Supreme Court,
      <i>
       see Estin v. Estin
      </i>
      , 334 U.S. 541, 68 S. Ct. 1213, 92 L. Ed. 1561 (1948);
      <i>
       Vanderbilt v. Vanderbilt
      </i>
      , 354 U.S. 416, 77 S. Ct. 1360, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1456 (1957) (spousal support);
      <i>
       Kulko v. Superior Court
      </i>
      , 436 U.S. 84, 98 S. Ct. 1690, 56 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1978) (child support).
     </p>
     <p>
      An initial difficulty arose because some authorities from foreign countries expressed concern about the UIFSA long-arm statute. This was especially true regarding Section 201(a)(1), i.e., service of legal process that creates personal jurisdiction, sometimes called "tag or ambush jurisdiction." Some experts in civil law countries regard the claim that jurisdiction can be acquired merely by serving documents on an individual passing through, with no fundamental ties to the jurisdiction, as "exorbitant," and fundamentally unfair. Another provision eliciting criticism was Section 201(a)(6), which literally reads that an allegation of engaging in sexual intercourse in the state that "may have" resulted in conception will suffice to support a basis for issuing a child support-order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, rules of jurisdiction recognized by civil law countries are contrary to the principles that apply to proceedings in the United States. The fact that residence of a child or an obligee in a forum is sufficient basis in most foreign countries to support a child-support order, even though the obligor has no personal nexus with the forum, is generally viewed as wholly inconsistent with notions of due process in the United States. Assuming the obligor has never been physically present in the forum and has not participated in any of the acts described in Section 201, an assertion of jurisdiction to establish a support order based solely on the residence of the obligee or child in that forum is widely regarded in the United States as unconstitutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Convention adopts a rule of indirect jurisdiction which requires a tribunal to register and enforce the order of another tribunal if certain basic jurisdictional requirements have been satisfied. The Convention does not actually prescribe the bases on which the tribunal may assert jurisdiction, as UIFSA does in Section 201. Most commonly, in countries other than the United States if a child is a "habitual resident" of a country, a support order of a tribunal of that country will be recognized in another country. As a practical matter, although "habitual residence" of the obligee provides no basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction over the obligor in the United States, the home tribunal is almost always the preferred forum if the obligee has any basis under Section 201 to obtain long-arm jurisdiction over a non-resident obligor. That is, the actual custodian of the child is almost always the person who seeks to establish and enforce child support and, if possible, chooses to bring a proceeding in the state of residence of the obligee and the child. A tribunal that recognizes "habitual residence" as a basis for indirect jurisdiction would, accordingly, register and enforce an order from a tribunal in the "habitual residence" of the obligee or child without concern about whether the obligor has a nexus with that tribunal. Thus, most foreign concerns about the tenuous reaches of long-arm jurisdiction in the United States are obviated in practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Convention eschews rules of direct jurisdiction, choosing instead to rely on half-a-dozen indirect rules of jurisdiction, "habitual residence" of any of the parties (respondent, creditor or child) being the most common. The focus of the Convention is to identify the bases on which a tribunal of one Convention country will be required to recognize the assertion of jurisdiction by a tribunal of another Convention country. When the Convention is in force in both countries, a support order issued by a tribunal of Country A will be enforced by a tribunal of Country B, provided that the order is enforceable in Country A, plus the host of other possible considerations discussed above. There are a limited number of exceptions, or "reservations," to such rules permitted under the Convention, which give rise to additional procedures noted below. Once recognition is accorded to a support order, the normal procedures available to enforce the order come into play. The routes to arrive at enforcement by way of direct or indirect jurisdiction are different, but the destination is the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually all foreign countries recognize and enforce a child-support order based on the residence of the obligee or the child. The U.S. requirement of personal jurisdiction over the obligor is often regarded abroad as idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, the new Convention requires recognition of U.S. orders based on long-arm jurisdiction asserted over the obligor, a.k.a. "debtor" if the forum state is also the state of residence of the obligee, a.k.a. "creditor." From the perspective of a foreign tribunal, such an order should be considered valid, if only for creditor- or child-based jurisdictional reasons. The fact that the state tribunal requires a personal nexus between the parties and the tribunal is irrelevant to the foreign tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      These distinct views of appropriate jurisdiction presented a genuine issue for resolution. The United States delegation took the position that, as a matter of constitutional law, its tribunals could not recognize and enforce creditor- or child-based support orders under certain factual circumstances accepted in other countries as providing appropriate jurisdiction. The conclusion of the delegation was that this approach conflicts with the
      <i>
       Kulko
      </i>
      decision,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      . The potential lack of nexus with the obligor, if jurisdiction was based solely on the "habitual residence" of the obligee, would present an impenetrable barrier to participation in the Convention by the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fairly early on in the Convention negotiations, a consensus developed that these different systems of jurisdiction could be accommodated. On the U.S. side, a challenge to a foreign child-support order will be rejected if the factual circumstances are sufficient to support an assertion of long-arm jurisdiction in the foreign tribunal. Rather obviously, the foreign tribunal need not, and almost certainly will not, consider whether there is a factual basis for establishing personal jurisdiction over the absent obligor based upon "minimum contacts" with the forum. This is not a part of the jurisprudence of the foreign tribunal. If a challenge to a support order is raised by the obligor when the order is sought for enforcement in a United States tribunal, however, that tribunal shall undertake a determination of whether the jurisdictional bases of Section 201 would have been applicable if that issue had been raised in the foreign tribunal. If so, the order is enforceable in this country, notwithstanding that the foreign tribunal based its decision on jurisdiction on the fact that the child or the obligee resided in that forum.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Convention art. 20(1)(c)-(d).
     </p>
     <p>
      Asserting long-arm jurisdiction to establish a support order by a tribunal in a proceeding under UIFSA will be unaffected by the entry into force of the Convention. This will be true irrespective of whether the nonresident respondent resides in another state or in a foreign country, or even resides in a non-Convention foreign nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term "habitually resident" is used in a number of private international law conventions, including the 2007 Maintenance Convention. The term is not defined in any of them. Rather, in common law countries its meaning is determined on a case-by-case basis by the practice and case law of each country. In the United States and elsewhere there is no consistent interpretation of the term by the courts considering it in the context of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The negotiators of the Convention from the United States made it clear that case law on the meaning of "habitually resident" in the child abduction context should not automatically be applied to child support cases. That is because the effect of the use of "habitual residence" in the 1980 Child Abduction Convention is intended to restrict the ability of a person to obtain a new custody order shortly after arriving in another country. In fact, one of the objects of the 1980 Convention is to limit the ability of a parent unhappy with the custody order of one court to "forum shop" by moving to another country and seeking a new order. In the 2007 Maintenance Convention, the object is to make it easier for an obligee to recover child support in an international case, not to restrict the ability of an obligee to apply for that support.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Due process under the Convention.
      </b>
      Subsection (b)(9)(A) applies to a failure to give a party prior notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, which is the classic denial of due process in a proceeding in the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b)(9)(B) will be unfamiliar to practitioners in this country and requires some explanation. This provision recognizes the legitimacy of, and provides a method for challenge of, a support order which may be routinely entered in some administrative systems in an ex parte proceeding. The support order is issued without prior notice to the obligor or opportunity to be heard. The due process opportunity is provided after the ex parte decision. This system is currently in use in administrative proceedings in Australia and New Zealand. Because the respondent will not have participated in the original proceeding, the post facto due process allows the obligor an opportunity to challenge the decision on fact or law.

      This section transforms Convention language into UIFSA terminology. If a responding tribunal is unable to enforce the entirety of a Convention support order, it shall enforce a severable part of the order. For example, a mother of a child may have another woman as her registered partner in a Convention country. If a support order provides support for both the mother and child support for the child, that part of the order awarding support to the mother from the registered partner may not be enforceable in some states. Nonetheless, a tribunal is obligated to recognize and enforce that part of the order for support of the child. The second sentence authorizes the mother to request enforcement only of the child support portion,

       COMMENT

     </p>
     <p>
      Section 701(6) provides an extensive definition of a "foreign support agreement," which is UIFSA terminology to make more readily understandable for U.S. bench and bar a process that is denominated as a "maintenance arrangement" in the Convention. Subsection (a) requires a state tribunal to recognize and enforce a foreign support agreement if the terms of this section are met. Most crucially, such an agreement must be accompanied by a document stating that the foreign support agreement is as enforceable as a support order would be in the country of origin.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section basically translates into common parlance the procedure identified in Convention art. 30, which was the result of a very extended discussions about "authentic instruments and private agreements" during the negotiations on the Convention. In many countries, such an agreement is unknown insofar as enforcement by a tribunal is concerned. In the United States, a purely private agreement is treated as a form of contract, rather than as an order of a tribunal. Under the Convention, however, a foreign support agreement meeting the standards established in this section, and as defined in Section 701(6), is entitled to enforcement by the tribunal. Advantages for enforcement of child support binding on the parties in the country of origin stem from the inclusion of a foreign support agreement because there is a growing tendency internationally to promote amicable solutions and avoid contentious procedures. In view of the movement towards alternative methods of dispute resolution in the United States, this mechanism provides for recognition and enforcement of a dispute resolution system in some of the likely Convention countries. The absence of this provision would have been a loss for the Convention, and limited its usefulness for support agreements, particularly in the Scandinavian countries. Although the possibility of a reservation is available, the United States has not indicated that it intends to make such a reservation.
     </p>
     <p>
      To reiterate, the key to enforcement is that the foreign support agreement must be "enforceable as a decision" in the foreign country of its origin (quoting the Convention). If such an agreement is enforceable only as a contract, it will not fall within the scope of this section. Another key provision is that under subsection (e) the enforcement proceeding will be suspended if the respondent challenges the underlying agreement in a tribunal that has jurisdiction to hear challenges to the agreement.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      One goal of the Convention was to limit the number of multiple foreign orders with respect to the same parties to the extent possible. But, given differing laws and jurisdictional bases, consensus on limiting modification was reached only on the fact patterns presented by Section 711(a).
     </p>
     <p>
      First, this section transforms Convention language into UIFSA terminology. The restriction identified on modification of a child-support order in subsection (a) strikes a familiar note. Similar to Section 611,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      , a restriction is placed on modification of a support order if the obligee remains in the issuing Convention country. Subsection (a)(1) provides an exception if, by failure to object, the obligee submits to the jurisdiction of another tribunal. Subsection (a)(2) is similar to Section 615,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      . From the perspective of the obligee, the restriction has virtually the same effect as found in Sections 205 and 611. That is, in effect the issuing foreign tribunal has a form of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction that it maintains over modification of the order so long as the obligee remains a resident of the country. The difference is that the protection against modification is accorded only to the obligee, and not to the obligor. Thus, under the Convention the obligee may be free to seek a modification in another forum notwithstanding the fact that the obligor remains in the issuing country but the obligee moves to another country, with the implicit requirement that the issuing foreign tribunal must have personal jurisdiction over the obligor to sustain the enforcement of modification by a state tribunal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) requires a state tribunal to issue a new child-support order if the Convention order was founded on child-based jurisdiction, the foreign tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the obligor, and there is a request to establish an order in accordance with Section 708.

       COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section is an almost word-for-word tracking of the Convention provision, rephrased in UIFSA terminology. This single sentence is illustrative of the different drafting rules for a uniform act and an international treaty. Although certainly not always adhered to, cardinal rules for drafting a uniform act include writing in the active voice, identifying the intended actor, and specifying the consequences for failure to follow the directive or ignore the proscription. Convention provisions, such as this one, are generally written in passive voice, the actor is not identified, and no penalty is specified for noncompliance. Insofar as the admirable goals of the provision are concerned, ambiguity in the statute, or an exception to the rule, must be resolved case-by-case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Confidentiality is highly prized in the United States in many circumstances, e.g., the attorney-client privilege is protected to the maximum extent possible. Under other circumstances, the opposite is true, e.g., records of litigation are generally available, and a judicial decision is ordinarily in open court or public record. Neither goal is absolute. Section 312,
      <i>
       supra
      </i>
      , adds another exception, i.e., nondisclosure of information is sometimes required to protect the health, safety, or liberty of a party or a child. In a case in which there is a risk of domestic violence or parental kidnapping, nondisclosure may be crucial.
     </p>
     <p>
      The anticipated breadth of application of this provision is to constrain individuals and entities subject to a Convention support order. Protection of personal information in this computerized world is increasingly important, whatever the medium or means of communication. Both the sender and recipient of personal information transmitted electronically are expected to take appropriate measures vis-…-vis their service providers to meet the requirements of this section. The exact meaning of the statutory phrase "for the purpose for which it was gathered or transmitted" will necessarily remain ambiguous until elaborated by statute, caselaw, or regulation.

      The United States will declare that English is the official language for transmittals to this country. Further, the United States will make a reservation objecting to the use of French, the other official language of the Convention, as a default translation. Of course, the original order may be in French. The cost of translation is borne by the issuing state or Convention country.

      This section has not been amended substantively since 1968. Virtually no controversy has been generated regarding this procedure. Arguably application of subsection (c) is problematic in situations in which the obligor neither was present in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the crime nor fled from the demanding state. The possibility that an individual may commit a crime in a state without ever being physically present there has elicited considerable discussion and some case law.

       Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least sixty days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this article or that the proceeding would be of no avail.

       If, under this article or a law substantially similar to this article, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.

       If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.

      This section has not undergone significant change since 1968. Interstate rendition remains the last resort for support enforcement, in part because a governor may exercise considerable discretion in deciding whether to honor a demand for rendition of an obligor.

       Any person who willfully neglects, fails, or refuses to provide reasonable support and maintenance for his spouse or for his children under eighteen years of age, whether natural, adopted, or whose parentage has been judicially determined, or who willfully fails, refuses, or neglects to provide proper care, food, and clothing in case of sickness for his spouse or such children or any such children being legally the inmates of a state or county home or school for children in this state, or who willfully fails or refuses to pay to a trustee, who may be appointed by the court to receive such payment, or to the board of control of such home or school the reasonable cost of keeping such children in said home, or any person, being the father or mother of children under eighteen years of age, who leaves such children with intent to abandon such children, or any man who willfully neglects, fails, or refuses to provide proper care, food, and clothing to the mother of his child during childbirth and attendant illness is guilty of a class 5 felony. It shall be an affirmative defense, as defined in section 18-1-407, C.R.S., to a prosecution under this section that owing to physical incapacity or other good cause the defendant is unable to furnish the support, care, and maintenance required by this section. No child shall be deemed to lack proper care for the sole reason that he is being provided remedial treatment in accordance with section 19-3-103, C.R.S.

        The supreme court was fortified in limiting the court's authority to require security for the payment of alimony
        
        by reason of the fact that with respect to orders for the payment of sums required for the support and maintenance and education of the minor children of the parties, the general assembly had enacted this section which made it a felony for a husband to neglect, fail or refuse to provide reasonable support and maintenance for his minor children under the age of 16 years.

        Therefore a father who neglects to discharge his natural, as well as his statutory, duty

        Formerly, the primary obligation for the support of a minor child rested upon its father,
        
        and the fact that the mother was self-supporting did not serve to relieve the father of his obligation. McQuade v. McQuade, 145

        Changing legislative view of role and capabilities of mother.
        
        This enlargement of the scope of protection for minor children suggests a legislative view that the role of the mother has expanded beyond the domestic sphere to which it had been relegated and that the economic abilities and opportunities of the parents are more nearly on a parity concerning their capability of providing support for their children. People v. Elliott, 186
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 65

        , 525 P.2d 457 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the father is under a legal duty or obligation to support his child
        
        in an adequate manner, resort to the courts may be had to enforce compliance, and such action is not made nonmaintainable because of statutory proceedings relating to the support of children in divorce, separate maintenance and annulment actions nor because of the statute relating to dependent and neglected children. McQuade v. McQuade, 145
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 218
        </cite>
        , 358 P.2d 470 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        The inherent right to support belongs to the child, and there exists no reason to hinge the enforcement of such right
        
        upon the existence or nonexistence of statutory right in the mother to obtain a divorce or separate maintenance, or upon a statute designed for children neglected by both parents. McQuade v. McQuade, 145

        The rights of the child exist independent of the rights of the mother,
        
        and are enforceable in equity in the absence of a statute providing for relief in the express circumstances. McQuade v. McQuade, 145

        An alleged father of an illegitimate child, in any case where such child is under 16 years of age,

       </p>
       <p>
        The gravamen of the offense is not the fathering of the illegitimate child,

       <p>
        This section does not attempt to punish the father for begetting or neglecting to support the child before the section took effect,
        
        but requires a defendant, as the father of a child, to contribute to his support and maintenance, thus relieving the mother or others upon whom the burden may chance to fall. Ortega v. Portales, 134

         The parent cannot be released of his duty to support the child by contract with anyone,

         II. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE AND EXCUSES FOR FAILURE TO SUPPORT.

       </h5>

        <b>
         "Support and maintenance" are of much broader import than "food, clothing, and shelter",
        </b>
        and may include many things besides food and clothing, and shelter. Campbell v. People, 42 Colo. 228, 94 P. 256 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Construed as applying to the duty of the husband when the wife is sick, the "food, clothing, and shelter" are properly connected,
        </b>
        and it seems to have been the intention of the general assembly to require the husband, whatever provision he may have made for his wife and minor children while they were well, that he furnish, not money, with which they may provide for their own comfort, but in the case of their sickness that he must, at his peril, provide them with proper food, clothing, shelter, and care. Campbell v. People, 42 Colo. 228, 94 P. 256 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         An information alleging that defendant "did willfully fail, refuse, and neglect to provide proper food, clothing, and shelter,
        </b>
        and care in case of sickness for his wife", was fatally defective, in that it failed to allege that defendant's wife was sick at the time it was charged he failed to provide for her. Campbell v. People, 42 Colo. 228, 94 P. 256 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "willfully" is defined as intentionally done without just cause, excuse or justification after notice and request for support.
        
        People v. Green, 178
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 77
        </cite>
        , 495 P.2d 549 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         To be willful the neglect must have occurred while defendant knew, or ought to have known,
        </b>
        that the need existed. Laws v. People, 59 Colo. 562, 151 P. 433 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where willful neglect to support minor children is an element of an offense under this section,
        
        it is proper for a court to instruct the jury on intent. Tucker v. People, 136
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 581
        </cite>
        , 319 P.2d 983 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because this section provides that the willful neglect, failure or refusal to provide reasonable support for a minor child or children is an element of the offense,
        
        therefore intent is material in a case, and it is proper for a court to so instruct the jury. Tucker v. People, 136
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 581
        </cite>
        , 319 P.2d 983 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Every person mentally capable of knowing right from wrong in relation to his acts is presumed to intend to do that which he does do,
        
        and to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act, and it is for a jury to determine the fact as to a defendant's intent, which may be shown by direct or by circumstantial evidence. Tucker v. People, 136
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 581
        </cite>
        , 319 P.2d 983 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent is an act or a purpose of the mind rarely discoverable except by the acts of a person, and is manifested
        
        by the circumstances connected with the perpetration of an offense, and the sound mind and discretion of the accused. Tucker v. People, 136
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 581

       </p>
       <p>
        The people sustained their burden of establishing that defendant willfully failed to provide the required child support
        
        when they showed that for a period of time he earned more than $400 per month and yet made no support payments. Gallegos v. People, 161
        <cite class="co_code">

       <p>
        A willful failure where the defendant is earning a salary has been defined,
        
        as intentionally done "without just cause, excuse or justification" after notice and request for support. Gallegos v. People, 161
        <cite class="co_code">

        That part of this section which states that a defendant is guilty of nonsupport when he willfully fails to provide that required support
        
        "unless it shall appear that owing to physical incapacity or other good cause he is unable to furnish the support, care, and maintenance herein required", is not a true exception. Gallegos v. People, 161
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 158
        </cite>
        , 420 P.2d 409 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        This is so because of the use of the term "willfully" in the first part of the section,
        
        and the supreme court holds that the word "willfully" is synonymous with the statutory expression which begins "unless it shall appear" Gallegos v. People, 161
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 158
        </cite>
        , 420 P.2d 409 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        This renders the later clause surplusage since "willfully" necessarily implies
        
        lack of just cause, excuse or justification; thus, allegation of the willful (or felonious) nature of the act is all that is required. Gallegos v. People, 161
        <cite class="co_code">

       </h5>
       <p>
        The word "feloniously" when used in an indictment or information has been held by the supreme court to be equivalent to the word "willfully",
        
        and its use satisfies the requirements of pleading the essential elements of the crime, though it is much better form to follow the precise statutory wording. Gallegos v. People, 161
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 158
        </cite>
        , 420 P.2d 409 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where an information filed with a justice of the peace on January 18, 1897, charging a party with failure to support his wife
        </b>
        alleged the time of the offense as "on or about the 19th day of September, and continuously since, A. D. 1897", it was held, that from the language employed charging the time when the offense was committed, it is fairly inferable that it was at a date prior to the filing of the information, and although it might have been successfully attacked at the proper time, by a motion on account of form, or ambiguity, it is too late to raise that question after trial. Poole v. People, 24 Colo. 510, 52 P. 1025 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section for failure to support an illegitimate child,
        
        it is not necessary to prove that the child is in need of support. Trujillo v. People, 122
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 436
        </cite>
        , 222 P.2d 775 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was permissible to introduce into evidence the register of a hotel where the complainant testified she and defendant had stayed overnight, where the defendant acknowledged signatures in the register as his own. Trujillo v. People, 122
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 436

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's action in excluding a letter written by the complainant to defendant's witness was not prejudicial to the defendant where the effect of the whole letter was to entreat the witness to tell the truth, if he did testify. Trujillo v. People, 122
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 436

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the complainant denied having had sex relations with anyone other than the defendant, and the defense put on four witnesses to testify to her alleged promiscuity, it was not error for the complainant to testify in rebuttal of the testimony of the four witnesses. Trujillo v. People, 122

       </p>
       <p>
        In such a prosecution, the state must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was not error for the trial court to refuse defendant's instruction which stated that the state had to prove its case simply by a preponderance of the evidence. Trujillo v. People, 122
        <cite class="co_code">

        Where there was judgment that defendant pay a certain sum monthly, etc., until the further order of the court, "and execute a bond in the sum, etc., for the faithful performance, etc., and upon failure, to be transported to the penitentiary to be there kept in close confinement at hard labor for three months", it was held a sufficient compliance with the statute.

       <p>
        In a prosecution for willful failure to support minor children, evidence of a pending criminal case against a defendant,

     <p>
      The commitment of any child, under any law of this state, to any state institution shall not relieve the parents or legal guardian of such child from responsibility for the support of the child. It is the duty of any court committing any child to any state institution or any private institution where such child is kept at the expense of the county or state, at the time of the commitment, to forthwith notify the district attorney, if a state expense, and the county attorney, if a county expense, of the name and address of such parents and such other information as may be adduced at any hearing of such case concerning the financial responsibility of the parents to care for such child. In order to obtain such information, any court committing any child, at the time of commitment or at any convenient time to be designated by the court, is authorized to require the attendance of the parents or legal guardian upon such court to be examined under oath concerning the property, possessions, and financial responsibility of such parents or legal guardian.

     <p>
      The state of Colorado or the county, as the case may be, at whose expense such child is kept shall be entitled to recover from the parent, legal guardian, or other person responsible for the support of such child such sum for the care, support, and maintenance of the child as may be reasonable therefor, and in no case shall such sum be less than the per capita monthly or yearly amount of expense in the institution in which the child is confined or the actual expense incurred by the state or county for the care and maintenance of such child. Any action or proceeding by the state or county against any parent shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure in civil cases. In case any action is maintained by the state, it shall be brought in the name of the people of the state of Colorado, and any moneys recovered in any action shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited to the particular fund for the benefit of the institution having the custody and care of such child. If an action is maintained by the county in cases where the county pays the expense of the care and maintenance of such child, such action shall be in the name of the board of county commissioners of such county or other body performing the functions of a board of county commissioners, and any amount collected in any such action shall be paid to the county treasurer of such county. When such action is prosecuted to a final judgment and judgment is rendered in favor of the people of the state of Colorado or the board of county commissioners of the county prosecuting such action, as the case may be, an execution may issue against the property of the defendant as in other civil cases.

      On or before December 1 of each year, it shall be the duty of the district attorney and the county attorney to make a written report to the governor of the state, stating the number of reports, provided for in section 14-7-101, received from the courts of the county or state and the nature and result of any action directed in this article by such officers respectively to recover from such parents the expenses of the care and maintenance of such children.

It is the duty of the county commissioners to pay any court costs or other expenses necessary for the prosecution of any suit provided for in this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to repeal any law of this state concerning the responsibility of parents to support their children, or providing for the punishment of parents or other persons responsible for the delinquency or dependency of children, or providing for the punishment of any parents for the nonsupport of their children; and nothing in such law shall prevent proceedings under this article in any proper case.

        Marriage dissolution action cannot be joined with an interspousal claim sounding in tort since this section encourages the amicable settlement of disputes between parties to a marriage. Simmons v. Simmons, 773 P.2d 602 (Colo. App. 1988); In re Lewis, 66 P.3d 204 (Colo. App. 2003).

        These policies take precedence over any contract arguments that may be raised by either spouse. Thus, the trial court was correct in refusing husband's indemnification argument and in interpreting the divorce decree as requiring the husband to compensate the wife for the fair market value of business property apportioned to her in the equitable distribution. In re Plesich, 881 P.2d 379 (Colo. App. 1994).

      <p>
       The general assembly recognizes that it is in the best interests of the parties to a marriage in which a dissolution has been granted and in which there are children of the marriage for the parties to be able to resolve disputes that arise subsequent to the dissolution in an amicable and fair manner. The general assembly further recognizes that, in most cases, it is in the best interests of the children of the marriage to have a relationship with both parents, including a parent with a disability, and that, in most cases, it is the parents' right to have a relationship with their children. The general assembly emphasizes that one of the underlying purposes of this article 10 is to mitigate the potential harm to the spouses and their children and the relationships between the parents and their children caused by the process of legal dissolution of marriage. The general assembly recognizes that when a marriage in which children are involved is dissolved, both parties either agree to or are subject to orders that contain certain obligations and commitments. The general assembly declares that the honoring and enforcing of those obligations and commitments made by both parties are necessary to maintaining a relationship that is in the best interest of the children of the marriage. Therefore, the general assembly declares that both parties should honor and fulfill all of the obligations and commitments made between the parties and ordered by the court.

         The state has a public interest in mitigating the potential harm to children caused by the dissolution of marriage.

        Thus, a parent has no privacy interest in the process by which child support obligations are determined because support levels are not purely private determinations but serve a public function and are subject to court approval. Stillman v. State, 87 P.3d 200 (Colo. App. 2003).

        Nor do the child support guidelines discriminate against a suspect class or significantly interfere with a fundamental right. Stillman v. State, 87 P.3d 200 (Colo. App. 2003).

       When filing a petition for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, a petition in support or proceedings for the allocation of parental responsibilities with respect to the children of the marriage, or any other matter pursuant to this article 10 with the court, if the parties have joint legal responsibility for a child for whom the petition seeks an order of child support, the parties are required to indicate on a form prepared by the court whether or not the parties or the dependent children of the parties have received within the last five years or are currently receiving benefits or public assistance from either the state department of human services or county department of human or social services. If the parties indicate that they have received such benefits or assistance, the court shall inform the appropriate delegate child support enforcement unit so that the unit can determine whether any support enforcement services are required. There is no penalty for failure to report as specified in this section.

        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 499
        </cite>
        , 542 P.2d 845 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of whether a marriage has been irretrievably broken is a question of fact to be resolved upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of each case, and the factors underlying that determination will necessarily vary from case to case. In re Baier, 39 Colo. App. 34, 561 P.2d 20 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of irretrievable breakdown must be proved when denied.
        
        While the dissolution of marriage act did eliminate all the former defenses to divorce in this state, it did not eliminate the necessity of proving an irretrievable breakdown where that basic allegation is denied in the pleadings. In re Franks, 189
        <cite class="co_code">

         No requirement that valid goals of marriage must be unattainable.
        </b>
        There is no requirement that for the marriage to be beyond redemption, substantial proportion of legitimate objectives of a marriage must be no longer attainable by the parties. In re Baier, 39 Colo. App. 34, 561 P.2d 20 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Elucidating valid goals of marriage which must be either lost or beyond accomplishment before the marriage can be classified as irretrievably broken would constitute an amendment to the act, and that power is reserved exclusively for the general assembly. In re Baier, 39 Colo. App. 34, 561 P.2d 20 (1977).

        Formerly, before a court could enter its findings in favor of a defendant,
        
        it must have necessarily found that the defendant had not been guilty of a violation of the marriage contract. Schleiger v. Schleiger, 137

       <p>
        In a divorce action where a defendant pleaded grounds for divorce by way of counterclaim,
        
        the issue was the guilt or innocence of the parties on the grounds alleged against each other, and findings by a trial court that plaintiff was entitled to a divorce was necessarily a finding against the defendant on the issues. Schleiger v. Schleiger, 137

An annulment proceeding is one in which the validity of a marriage is challenged from its inception on the ground that one or both of the parties was underage, on the ground that one or both of the parties was married to another person, on the ground that the proceeding was attended by fraud, or on some other fairly comparable ground. An action for divorce is one in which termination is sought of a valid marriage. Gainey v. Fleming, 279 F.2d 56 (10th Cir. 1960).

        <p>
         Originally, authority to grant divorces and annul marriages in England was vested solely in the ecclesiastical courts.
         
         This authority terminated around 1870, during the reign of Victoria, at which time a special court was created to hear and decide all divorces and annulments of marriage, but ecclesiastical courts and their authority never became a part of American common law.

         In the interplay of this section and the rules of civil procedure,

        <p>
         A cursory reading of C.R.C.P. 38(a) makes obvious the conclusion that an annulment suit
         
         does not come within the meaning of any of the enumerated actions requiring trial by jury unless waived. Young v. Colo. Nat'l Bank, 148

        <p>
         But C.R.C.P. 39(c)
         
         provides that in actions not triable by a jury, the court may upon motion or of its own initiative try any issue with an advisory jury, or when statute provides for trial without a jury, the court with the consent of both parties may order a jury trial. Young v. Colo. Nat'l Bank, 148

        </p>
        <p>
         Proof in an annulment case must be clear and convincing, and the court should so instruct the jury,
         
         and the preponderance rule is inapplicable. Young v. Colo. Nat'l Bank, 148

         It has been established that a husband and wife may enter into contracts which settle their differences,
         
         and the trial court, while determining division of property accumulated during the marriage, cannot disregard such a contract where it is free from fraud, collusion, compulsion, or unconscionability. Magarrell v. Magarrell, 144

         <b>
          Precedential value of prior decisions.
         </b>
         In interpreting the current statute, the courts do not consider that the decisions on separation agreements incorporated in decrees in actions arising under the 1917 act (CRS 53, § 46-1-5) have any precedential value. In re Seymour, 36 Colo. App. 104, 536 P.2d 1172 (1975).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section is explicitly limited to separation agreements;
         
         antenuptial agreements cannot be challenged as unconscionable under this section. In re Stokes, 43 Colo. App. 461, 608 P.2d 824 (1979); In re Newman v. Newman, 653 P.2d 728 (
         <cite class="co_code">

         </cite>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Separation agreements and antenuptial agreements are separate and distinct
         
         legal documents. In re Newman, 44 Colo. App. 307, 616 P.2d 982 (1980), aff'd in part and rev'd on other grounds, 653 P.2d 728 (
         <cite class="co_code">

         <b>
          While separation agreements contemplate disposition of property interests which mature because of the marriage status,
         </b>
         prenuptial agreements fix the property rights of the parties, regardless of the duration of the marriage. In re Stokes, 43 Colo. App. 461, 608 P.2d 824 (1979); In re Lemoine-Hofmann, 827 P.2d 587 (Colo. App. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Spouses-to-be have right to enter into antenuptial agreements
         
         which contemplate the possibility of dissolution. In re Newman, 44 Colo. App. 307, 616 P.2d 982 (1980), aff'd in part and rev'd on other grounds, 653 P.2d 728 (

          Where husband conceded that wife put him through college pursuant to their oral prenuptial agreement,
         </b>
         such agreement is not void pursuant to statute of frauds since oral contracts otherwise unenforceable under § 38-10-101, et seq., may substitute for a writing if there is part performance of the oral contract. In re Lemoine-Hofmann, 827 P.2d 587 (Colo. App. 1992).

         <b>
          Standard for review compared with review of antenuptial agreement.
         </b>
         The standard applied for court review of the division of property in a separation agreement allows the court more discretion than the standard for court review of the division of property in an antenuptial agreement. In re Manzo, 659 P.2d 669 (Colo. 1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         Courts reviewing separation agreements prior to entry of a decree of dissolution need more latitude than is allowed for review of antenuptial agreements because of the public policy concern for safeguarding the interests of a spouse whose consent to the agreement may have been obtained under more emotionally stressful circumstances, especially if that spouse is unrepresented by counsel. In re Manzo, 659 P.2d 669 (Colo. 1983).

         Where parties to a divorce action had settled all their differences by agreement, and the only duties of husband are those set forth therein,
         
         there being no authority for the allowance of attorney fees to the wife, the court was without authority to award such fees. Irwin v. Irwin, 150

         The trial court, in determining the pecuniary provision for the wife upon granting a decree of
         
         divorce to her, has no right to disregard a previous agreement free from fraud, collusion, or compulsion, and fair to her, entered into between her and her husband in contemplation of a divorce, settling and adjusting all their property rights, including dower, alimony, and support.

         Where there was a self-operative trust agreement between the parties to a divorce action in settlement of their property rights,
         
         such agreement was binding upon the parties, and the court was without jurisdiction to set it aside, no showing of fraud, duress, or mistake appearing. Brown v. Brown, 131

        <p>
         Formerly, an agreement between husband and wife which provided for alimony or property settlement
         
         in contemplation of divorce was presumptively fair, and the burden was on the wife to establish the contrary. Newey v. Newey, 161

          An agreement between present spouses entered into "attendant upon" separation or dissolution

         must be considered a separation agreement, rather than a marital agreement, even if it was signed prior to filing for dissolution of marriage or legal separation. If an agreement is executed under circumstances accompanying, connected with, or surrounding a contemplated divorce or separation, it is considered a separation agreement. In re Bisque, 31 P.3d 175 (Colo. App. 2001); In re Lafaye, 89 P.3d 455 (Colo. App. 2003).

         Review of provisions before incorporation into dissolution decree.
         
         Before a court incorporates property division provisions of a separation agreement into a dissolution decree, it should first review the provisions for fraud, overreaching, concealment of assets, or sharp dealing not consistent with the obligations of marital partners to deal fairly with each other, and then look at the economic circumstances of the parties which result from the agreement, including a determination whether under the totality of the circumstances the property disposition is fair, just and reasonable. In re Manzo, 659 P.2d 669 (
         <cite class="co_code">
          Colo. 1983

        </p>
        <p>
         To set aside a property settlement agreement prior to its being incorporated in a dissolution decree, the court need not find that overreaching, inequality of bargaining power, or other elements of fraud are present. Rather, before the agreement is set forth in the decree, a court may set aside as unconscionable any agreement that is not "fair, reasonable and just". In re Wigner, 40 Colo. App. 253, 572 P.2d 495 (1977); In re Thornhill, 200 P.3d 1083 (Colo. App. 2008), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 232 P.3d 782 (

         Separation agreement that did not provide wife with interest on her share of husband's business paid out over time was unconscionable.
         
         In the parties' separation agreement, husband agreed to make monthly payments to wife over a 10-year period for payment of her share of the value of the marital business. The agreement did not require the husband to pay interest on the total sum owed to wife or to secure the obligation. The lack of an interest provision in the agreement rendered the entire agreement unconscionable. In re Thornhill, 200 P.3d 1083 (Colo.

          IV. INCORPORATION OF AGREEMENT INTO DECREE.

        <p>
         Formerly, where the stipulation and property settlement was approved by the courts, but the terms thereof were not set forth in a decree of divorce,
         
         the rights of the parties rested upon a contract, and not upon the decree, and were contractual and not decreed rights and obligations. Murphy v. Murphy, 138

         Formerly, where parties to a divorce action entered into a binding contract settling all their differences,
         
         the obligation of each to the other stemmed from the contract, and relief, if any, must have been based upon the rights of the parties under the contract. Irwin v. Irwin, 150

        <p>
         Formerly, where a trial court in a divorce action had no part in determining the property and financial rights of the parties,
         
         other than to approve and confirm an agreement purporting to settle all such financial and property rights, the incorporation of such agreement by references in the interlocutory or final decree in the action did not make the terms of such agreement an order or decree of the court, and was not a determination by the court of the respective rights of the parties, but was their voluntary adjustment of their differences, and unless the terms thereof are adopted by the court and fully and specifically set forth in the order or decree, the rights of the parties rest wholly upon the contract and not upon the decree of the court.

          Prior to incorporation in decree, separation agreement is contract.

          Incorporation by reference allowed.

        </p>
        <p>
         So long as it is clear what document is being referred to and that the parties intended for it to be a part of the decree, such incorporation is within the underlying purposes of this section and there is no apparent reason for requiring the recopying of the words into the court order.

         If an executed agreement for a division of property was not incorporated in or made a part of an interlocutory and final decree of divorce,

         If the property rights and obligations of the parties to a divorce action who had entered into a settlement agreement
         
         were to rest upon the court decree, then any such agreement as to those rights should have been fully and specifically set forth in the decree in order that the duties and rights could be definitely ascertained from the decree itself. Taylor v. Taylor, 147

         Formerly, where parties to a divorce action entered into an agreement settling their property rights, which agreement it incorporated in the final decree,

          Modification or revocation of agreement incorporated into decree.
         </b>
         Where the parties' property settlement agreement has been incorporated into the decree of dissolution, it is subject to revocation or modification to the same extent as a property division rendered solely by the court. In re Stroud, 631 P.2d 168 (Colo. 1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Modification of property division provisions.
         </b>
         Once property division provisions of a separation agreement have been incorporated into a dissolution of marriage decree, they may not be set aside or modified unless the conditions of C.R.C.P. 60 are met. In re Seely, 689 P.2d 1154 (Colo. App. 1984); Camack v. Camack, 62 P.3d 1097 (Colo. App. 2002).

        <p>
         <b>
          When court has power to modify maintenance.
         </b>
         A trial court has authority to test a settlement agreement on the standard of present unconscionability and for possible modification of maintenance under two circumstances: If the agreement or the decree reserves that power to the trial court, or, if the agreement and the decree are silent on the power to modify. In re Thompson, 640 P.2d 279 (Colo. App. 1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         The court retained jurisdiction to modify the separation agreement where the agreement specifically provided that the issue of retirement benefits obtained as a result of the husband's military service shall remain open and modifiable. In re Sinkovich, 830 P.2d 1101 (Colo. App. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Restriction of court's jurisdiction to modify must be unequivocal.
         </b>
         While subsection (6) permits the parties to restrict the jurisdiction of the court to modify the maintenance terms of a settlement agreement, such a restriction must specifically and unequivocally preclude modification. In re Rother, 651 P.2d 457 (Colo. App. 1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Where maintenance provision not modifiable.
         </b>
         Where there was no reservation in the trial court of the power to modify a maintenance provision, the court cannot do so later. In re Thompson, 640 P.2d 279 (Colo. App. 1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         The waiver of the right to seek modification in and of itself could well be the consideration for a concession in the amount or duration of maintenance, or in the property received by a party. Thus, to permit reconsideration of the amount of maintenance contracted for, without also reopening the property division, would be inequitable. In re Thompson, 640 P.2d 279 (Colo. App. 1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Modification by parties' agreement not reservation to court of power.
         </b>
         The fact that an agreement allows modification by agreement of the parties is not a reservation to the court of the power to modify; rather, it is a limitation on the court's power. In re Thompson, 640 P.2d 279 (Colo. App. 1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         Only unequivocal language in the terms of the settlement precludes the court from modifying the support provisions. No such language existed where the settlement provided that the period for payment of maintenance could be extended by further order of the court. Aldinger v. Aldinger, 813 P.2d 836 (Colo. App. 1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the parties' dissolution decree incorporated a separation agreement that stated that the husband's retirement benefits remained open and modifiable, the trial court had the authority to divide the husband's military retirement pension. In re Sinkovich, 830 P.2d 1101 (Colo. App. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Modification of agreement permitted upon showing of fraud or overreaching.
         </b>
         Where the terms of a divorce decree specifically preclude modification, without the written consent of the parties, a court can modify the agreement only upon a showing of fraud or overreaching. In re Cohen, 44 Colo. App. 200, 610 P.2d 1092 (1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where separation agreement and alimony not modifiable.
         
         Where a separation agreement was adopted and incorporated into the decree of divorce, and the agreement did not reserve to the court jurisdiction to modify the terms of the alimony provision, nor did the court in its order adopting and incorporating the agreement into the divorce decree specifically reserve the right to modify the terms thereof, the court cannot later modify the agreement or the alimony provisions.

         attorney fees can be awarded if the case involves an agreement or contract for an award of such fees to the prevailing party. Marital agreements governing the manner in which each party's attorney fees will be paid should be enforced by the trial court, and the determination of which party succeeded or prevailed under a contractual fee-shifting provision is committed to the discretion of the trial court subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review on appeal. In re Sanchez-Vigil, 151 P.3d 621 (Colo. App. 2006).

        <p>
         To be a prevailing party for the purpose of an award of attorney fees pursuant to a contract, the applicant must have succeeded upon a significant issue presented by the litigation and must have achieved some of the benefits sought in the lawsuit. A party need not prevail upon the "central" issue, only upon a significant one. In re Watters, 782 P.2d 1220 (Colo. App. 1989); In re Sanchez-Vigil, 151 P.3d 621 (Colo. App. 2006).

         These policies take precedence over any contract arguments that may be raised by either spouse. Thus, the trial court was correct in refusing husband's indemnification argument and in interpreting the divorce decree as requiring the husband to compensate the wife for the fair market value of business property apportioned to her in the equitable distribution.

          It is improper for the court to continue a joint or common tenancy between divorced spouses in marital property.

         This issue of property division in a divorce action is not one of marital fault, but whether the wife is entitled thereto

          Although marital fault or misconduct may not be considered by the trial court when it is dividing marital assets, economic fault may be considered.

         Economic fault comes into play in extreme cases, such as a spouse's dissipation of marital assets in the contemplation of divorce, and it must be strictly confined so as not to circumvent the prohibition against consideration of marital fault.

         Formerly, it was only one of the elements to be taken into consideration,

         Maintenance and property settlement must be considered together

However, classifying student loan debt as marital debt does not preclude court from allocating responsibility for payment of the loan to the party who incurred the loan.

         As a practical consequence of that language, the trial court may not consider any such prospective inheritance as either a property interest or as an economic circumstance.

         Justice requires that the joint accumulations of a husband and wife, or property which was acquired during marriage
         
         or added to through the joint efforts of both spouses, should be considered for equitable division on termination of the marriage. Kalcevic v. Kalcevic, 156

         The public employees' retirement association's interest of the husband or his estate is not subject to divestment by death or discharge. At some time, he or his estate must receive, at the very minimum, the amount of accumulated deductions in his individual account. His rights have a presently determinable cash surrender value equal to his salary deductions which otherwise would have been available for the use of the parties during the marriage. Even though the husband's interest in the fund is, by its very nature, incapable of division in kind, the value of that interest was properly taken into account in a marital property division.

         Resembles division of property by co-owners rather than conveyance.
         
         Transfer of property by husband to his former wife in fulfillment of a property settlement agreement entered into by the parties and approved by the court granting the divorce is a recognition of a "species of common ownership" of the marital estate by the wife resembling a division of property between co-owners and is not a transfer which resembles a conveyance by the husband for the release of an independent obligation owed by him to the wife.

         Property acquired before legal separation deemed marital.
         
         Property acquired subsequent to a marriage but after the parties have separated without a decree of legal separation is not excepted from "marital property" by subsection (2). In re Carruthers, 40 Colo. App. 278, 577 P.2d 773 (1977); In re Huff, 834 P.2d 244 (

        </p>
        <p>
         Where parties lived apart for over eleven years without a decree of legal separation or a valid agreement for exclusion of property, property acquired during that period was marital property. In re Huff, 834 P.2d 244 (Colo. 1992).

         <b>
          The presumption that property acquired by either spouse after marriage is marital property may be overcome
         </b>
         by establishing that the property in question was acquired by a method listed in subsection (2). Assets not falling with the specific definition of separate property are deemed to be marital in nature subject to equitable division by the court. In re McCadam, 910 P.2d 98 (Colo.

         Marital agreements must be in writing and signed by both parties.
         
         Although subsection (2)(d) does not require a "valid agreement" to be in writing, the more specific language of the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreement Act prevails over the general language in this section. Therefore, parties' oral agreement during marriage to exclude the parties' respective retirement accounts and inheritances from the marital estate was not a valid agreement. In re Zander,

         Home excluded from marital property when husband conveyed the home to wife as her separate property through an interspousal transfer deed with the intent to make it her separate property.
         
         Although not a marital agreement under the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act, because it was not signed by both parties, transfer was upheld because husband conveyed the property to wife as her sole property, admitting that this was his intent and that he was familiar with the concept of separate property and the effect of the transfer. A conveyance is different from an agreement to convey. Therefore, the interspousal transfer deed did not have to meet the requirements and formalities of the act. In re Blaine,

         A trial court having reached its conclusions and entered its order and judgment on documentary evidence alone,
         
         the supreme court was as well qualified to determine the equities involved in a divorce action concerning a division of the property of the parties as was the trial court, and under such circumstances, presumptions in favor of the correctness of the order and judgment were not conclusive.

         conclusions of an appellate court on issues presented to it, as well as rulings logically necessary to sustain such conclusions, become the law of the case and generally must be followed in subsequent proceedings in that case. However, application of the law of the case by a trial court to its property division rulings entered prior to an appeal is a discretionary rule of practice. The trial court's original permanent orders lose any binding effect or precedential value when they are reversed on appeal. In re Burford, 26 P.3d 550 (Colo. App. 2001).

          Annotator's note.
         </b>
         Since § 14-10-114, effective January 1, 2014, is similar to § 14-10-114 as it existed prior to its 2013 repeal and reenactment, relevant cases construing that provision and former provisions similar to that section have been included in the annotations to this section.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Any award of maintenance to a spouse in Colorado is a personal statutory right and not a property right.

          The spirit of this section was comprehensive enough to cover a case where there might be some question

          Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act provides separate sections that govern the different elements of a dissolution order,
         </b>
         specifically property disposition, maintenance, child support, and attorney fees. The court is required to make separate orders regarding these elements based on separate considerations and may not commingle one element with another. In re Huff, 834 P.2d 244 (Colo. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          There is a distinction between maintenance awards and property settlements.
         </b>
         Property divisions are intended to accomplish a just apportionment of marital property over time, whereas maintenance is intended be a substitute for marital support that can be used, for example, to ease a spouse's transition into the work force and prevent the spouse from becoming dependent on public assistance. In re Wise, 264 B.R. 701 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
         Division of property is mandatory under § 14-10-113, whereas an award of maintenance is discretionary under this section. In re Wise, 264 B.R. 701 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2001).
        </p>

         <b>
          Maintenance used to balance equities.
         </b>
         A trial court may use an award of maintenance as a tool to balance equities and compensate a spouse whose work has enabled the other spouse to obtain an education; however, this tool is available for use only where the spouse seeking maintenance meets the statutory threshold requirements of need. In re McVey, 641 P.2d 300 (Colo. App. 1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that it would be equitable in view of the division of property for the income of husband and wife to be relatively equal. In re Martin, 707 P.2d 1035 (Colo. App. 1985).
        </p>

         Reading section as a whole illustrates that the general assembly intended the guidelines to be advisory in nature and did not intend to cap or restrict

         The divorce decree was the principal thing and the judgment for alimony was incidental,
         
         and whether they were entered separately or together, they were treated as part of the same decree. Miller v. Miller, 129

        </p>
        <p>
         It was well-established in Colorado that the courts viewed the testimony in alimony and property settlement
         
         matters in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. Gleason v. Gleason, 162
         <cite class="co_code">
          Colo. 212

         Alimony was defined generally as payments necessary for food, clothing, habitation, and other necessities for the support of the wife.

        <p>
         Insurance policies and the premiums necessary to maintain them in full force were not in any sense to provide for food,
         
         clothing, habitation, or other necessities for the support of the wife. Magarrell v. Magarrell, 144
         <cite class="co_code">

        </p>
        <p>
         An award to the wife of the use, possession, and income of the real estate did not constitute an award of alimony,
         
         because the right to use and possession and the income of real property were but incidents of the ownership of that property. McDonald v. McDonald, 150

        <p>
         When parties availed themselves of the good offices of the court to fix the amounts of alimony to be paid
         
         from time to time and themselves changed the action from one for separate maintenance to one for divorce, it was assumed that they submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for the entry of such orders as it deemed just and fair in accordance. Gavette v. Gavette, 104

         The trial court properly determined questions of alimony and support basing its findings on the financial conditions,

          Fact that parties are in debt and having serious financial problems at time of dissolution does not preclude a nominal award of maintenance,

         It was an abuse of discretion, to award a wife the equivalent of one-third of the husband's estate,
         
         instead of a periodical payment for her support. Vines v. Vines, 137

          Antenuptial agreement no bar to maintenance unless specifically stated.
         </b>
         In the absence of any reference in an antenuptial agreement to a relinquishment of the right to maintenance, the agreement does not bar the wife's claim for maintenance. In re Stokes, 43 Colo. App. 461, 608 P.2d 824 (1979).

         Antenuptial agreement did not preclude an award of maintenance or reflect any waiver of maintenance by wife. In re Meisner, 715 P.2d 1273 (Colo. App. 1985).

        <p>
         Antenuptial maintenance agreement is subject to judicial scrutiny for conscionability.
         
         In re Newman v. Newman, 653 P.2d 728 (
         <cite class="co_code">
          Colo. 1982

        <p>
         "Unconscionability",
         
         as applied to a maintenance agreement, exists when enforcement of the terms of the agreement results in a spouse having insufficient property to provide for his reasonable needs and who is otherwise unable to support himself through appropriate employment. In re Newman v. Newman, 653 P.2d 728 (
         <cite class="co_code">
          Colo. 1982

        <p>
         Maintenance agreement may become unconscionable because of circumstances at time of dissolution.
         
         Even though an antenuptial agreement is entered into in good faith, with full disclosure and without any element of fraud or overreaching, the maintenance provisions thereof may become voidable for unconscionability occasioned by circumstances existing at the time of the marriage dissolution. In re Newman v. Newman, 653 P.2d 728 (
         <cite class="co_code">
          Colo. 1982

          Burden of proof of unconscionability.
         </b>
         One who claims that an antenuptial maintenance agreement is unconscionable must prove that at the time of the marriage dissolution the maintenance agreement rendered the spouse without a means of reasonable support, either because of a lack of property resources or a condition of unemployability. In re Newman v. Newman, 653 P.2d 728 (Colo. 1982).

          Trial court correctly excluded father's voluntary enhanced retirement program (VERP) benefit from calculation of his gross income.
         </b>
         In determining whether the VERP benefit constitutes income for child support purposes, the court must answer the following questions: (1) Is the VERP benefit severance pay? (2) Is the VERP benefit an employer contribution to pension and retirement benefits? (3) Should an undistributed employer contribution be treated as income? (4) Does father's option to elect a lump sum distribution or monthly annuity payments of his retirement account, including the VERP benefit, mean that the VERP benefit should be credited as income? In re Mugge, 66 P.3d 207 (Colo. App. 2003).

        <p>
         The requirements that father voluntarily retire rather than be terminated and that he provide a general release of the employer distinguish the VERP benefit from a typical severance pay program, and thus the VERP benefit was not severance pay includable within the statutory definition of gross income. In re Mugge, 66 P.3d 207 (Colo. App. 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         The employer denominated the VERP benefit as a retirement benefit, credited the benefit to the father's retirement account in its pension plan, and calculated the amount using age and years of service, therefore the VERP benefit was an employer-contributed pension or retirement benefit. In re Mugge, 66 P.3d 207 (Colo. App. 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the employer determined the amounts of pension plan contributions and the employees did not have the option of directly receiving the amounts as wages, prior to any distribution, the employer's VERP contribution to father's account in its pension plan did not constitute gross income for consideration under the child support guidelines.

         Applying the definition of income in this section, the court determined that it was not income because father did not have the ability to use it to pay his expenses, including child support. Father was not vested in the plan, there was no account in his name, the plan would pay only upon retirement if certain conditions were met, and father would forfeit the plan if he was fired, quit, or retired before age sixty-five, and once retired, it would pay out over 10 years.

         Imposition of higher degree of objectivity on a child's attorney.
        </b>
        An attorney appointed to represent a child in a custody dispute must present all evidence available concerning the child's best interests. The attorney's role is not simply to parrot the child's expressed wishes. In re Barnthouse, 765 P.2d 610 (Colo. App. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1021, 109 S. Ct. 1747, 104 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1989).

        <b>
         Trial court did abuse its discretion by denying a motion for appointment of a child representative to present the child's wishes regarding parenting time.
        </b>
        A child representative cannot be called as a witness and cannot represent a child's views without question. The attorney is charged with a higher degree of objectivity than when representing an adult. In re Custody of C.J.S., 37 P.3d 479 (Colo. App. 2001).

        Attorney should practice in county of child's residence.
        
        If the court, in exercise of its discretion, appointed an attorney to represent these minor children, it is obvious that in terms of client access and the mitigation of expenses, any attorney so appointed should be practicing in the county where the child is residing.

         Court's order specifying that the special advocate's cost may be later assessed between the parties

        sufficiently preserved the issue, despite the father's original indication in his motion for appointment of a special advocate that he would pay the special advocate's initial fee. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion requiring mother to later share in that fee. In re Emerson, 77 P.3d 923 (Colo. App. 2003).

        <p>
         A husband was not prejudiced by the entering of a judgment for the correct total amount due under a divorce decree,
         
         as each installment which matures under a decree which had not been modified became a judgment debt similar to any other judgment for money. Jenner v. Jenner, 138

        <p>
         A trial court had power, without previous notice to a husband, to enter judgment for any total arrears
         
         so that execution might issue thereon and the proceedings available to any judgment creditor could thereby be made available to the wife. Jenner v. Jenner, 138

        <p>
         The trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in an order limiting the wife's right to collect her judgment on an arrearage,
         
         because the judgment entered was no different than any other money judgment, and the wife was entitled to levy execution on her judgment in the same manner as any other judgment creditor was entitled to collect on a judgment, and no authority empowered the trial court to enter an order authorizing a judgment creditor to parcel out payments in liquidating a judgment.

         but is ancillary to the motion and may be decided independently of the modification motion. The underlying motion, once decided, is a final appealable order, notwithstanding the unresolved request for attorney fees. In re Nelson,

The provisions as to property disposition may not be revoked or modified unless the court finds the existence of conditions that justify the reopening of a judgment.

          In any action or proceeding in any court of this state in which child support, maintenance when combined with child support, or maintenance is ordered, a payment becomes a final money judgment, referred to in this section as a support judgment, when it is due and not paid. Such payment is not retroactively modified except pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section and may be enforced as other judgments without further action by the court; except that an existing child support order with respect to child support payable by the obligor may be modified retroactively to the time that a mutually agreed upon change of physical custody occurs pursuant to subsection (5) of this section. A support judgment is entitled to full faith and credit and may be enforced in any court of this state or any other state. In order to enforce a support judgment, the obligee shall file with the court that issued the order a verified entry of support judgment specifying the period of time that the support judgment covers and the total amount of the support judgment for that period. The obligee or the delegate child support enforcement unit is not required to wait fourteen days to execute on such support judgment. However, a copy of the verified entry of support judgment must be provided to all parties pursuant to rule 5 of the Colorado rules of civil procedure, upon filing with the court. A verified entry of support judgment is not required to be signed by an attorney. A verified entry of support judgment may be used to enforce a support judgment for debt entered pursuant to section 14-14-104. The filing of a verified entry of support judgment revives all individual support judgments that have arisen during the period of time specified in the entry of support judgment and that have not been satisfied, pursuant to rule 54 (h) of the Colorado rules of civil procedure, without the requirement of a separate motion, notice, or hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (1)(c), no court order for support judgment nor verified entry of support judgment is required in order for the county and state child support enforcement units to certify past-due amounts of child support to the internal revenue service or to the department of revenue for purposes of intercepting a federal or state tax refund or lottery winnings.

In no instance shall the order be retroactively modified prior to the date of filing, unless there has been a mutually agreed upon change of physical custody. The court may modify installments of maintenance or child support due between the filing of the motion and the entry of the order even if the circumstances justifying the modification no longer exist at the time the order is entered.

In any IV-D case in which current child support, child support when combined with maintenance, or maintenance has been ordered, a payment becomes a support judgment when it is due and not paid, and a lien therefor is created by operation of law against the obligor's real and personal property and any interest in any such real or personal property. The entry of an order for child support debt, retroactive child support, or child support arrearages or a verified entry of judgment pursuant to this section creates a lien by operation of law against the obligor's real and personal property and any interest in any such real and personal property.

       The amendment to subsection (5) that was effective January 1, 2017, was intended by its plain language to operate on motions filed after its effective date, even if the change in physical care predated the amendment.
       
       Subsection (5) is remedial in nature and its limitation provision is simply a limitation on the remedy: Regardless of when the change in custody occurred, relief is limited to the five years preceding the filing of the motion. The application of a limitation on a remedy to an existing claim for relief does not violate the prohibition against retroactive legislation. In re Weekes,

         There is no specific provision in this section, controlling the procedure by which a property division order may be reopened. Therefore, in order to determine whether the judgment may be reopened, reference must be made to C.R.C.P. 60. In re Scheuerman, 42 Colo. App. 206, 591 P.2d 1044 (1979).

         Applications for a reduction in child support payments based on such a change in the mother's financial condition as her gainful employment,
         
         an increase in her earnings, her acquisition of property, or the like, have been denied in many cases, where no other circumstances warranted a reduction in the payments, because a mother's employment or income does not relieve the father of the obligation to support his children under a support order, and the mother's employment or property would not inure to the father's benefit as a change of circumstances diminishing his obligation to support children.

         Equitable estoppel doctrine did not bar relief from accrued child support arrearages.
         
         While the trial court found that father made reduced child support payments in reliance upon his agreement with mother, there were no findings that father was either unaware of the continuing obligations under the original support order or lacked the knowledge or means to seek modification of it. Further, the father did not detrimentally rely on mother's acts or representations, such as incurring additional expenses for either the child or himself or by giving up a benefit based upon the agreement. Accrued child support arrearages will be abated only under extremely limited circumstances, such as concealment of the child or uncompleted adoption proceedings. In re Beatty,

        <p>
         Good faith retirement does not create a reason that automatically terminates a payor's duty to pay maintenance.
         
         Subsection (2)(b) creates a "rebuttable presumption" that a payor who retires "after reaching full retirement age" has retired in "good faith." This rebuttable presumption is not conclusive on the question of whether the court should terminate the payor's maintenance obligation. Because the presumption is rebuttable, the spouse who is receiving maintenance must have the opportunity to rebut the presumption. Once the payor satisfies the rebuttable presumption created by subsection (2)(b), the presumption shifts the burden of going forward to the recipient to show that the payor's decision to retire was not made in good faith. If the recipient does not meet this burden, then the court will presume, as a matter of law, that the payor's decision to retire was made in good faith. In re Thorstad,

         , 434 P.3d 165.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a payor asks a court to modify or to terminate a maintenance obligation because he or she intends to retire, then the court should follow a general rule.
         
         First, applying subsections (2)(b) and (2)(c), it should decide whether the payor's decision to retire was made in good faith. Second, it should then incorporate its findings concerning the payor's decision to retire as one of the factors to consider in deciding whether, under subsection (1)(a), circumstances have changed in such a substantial and continuing way as to make the original order unfair. In re Thorstad,

         Formerly, the necessity for a separate maintenance could have terminated at any time by reconciliation of the parties,
         
         or by the death of one of them. Vines v. Vines, 137
         <cite class="co_code">

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          The general rule was that reconciliation did not automatically terminate property settlement agreements,
         </b>
         and the courts in such cases looked to the intent of the parties to determine if reconciliation was meant to revoke the property settlement agreement, and the question of whether or not reconciliation affects a property settlement agreement was a question of fact to be determined by the evidence.

          It is error as a matter of law
         </b>
         to fail to weigh the evidence giving due consideration and thought to all of the statutory factors of § 14-10-115 (1) where the noncustodial parent has ample resources with which to contribute to his children's education, and their ability to acquire and their need for an education are established by the evidence. In re Pring, 742 P.2d 343 (Colo. App. 1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         Hence, the trial court erred in requiring these children to exhaust their own assets for educational purposes before requiring either parent to contribute to their education. In re Pring, 742 P.2d 343 (Colo. App. 1987).

        The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that domestic violence is a pervasive problem in society and that a significant portion of domestic violence in society occurs in or near the home. The general assembly further recognizes research demonstrating that children in a home where domestic violence occurs are at greater risk of emotional, psychological, and physical harm. Studies have found that eighty to ninety percent of the children living in homes with domestic violence are aware of the violence. The general assembly finds that emerging research has established that these children are at greater risk of the following: Psychological, social, and behavioral problems; higher rates of academic problems; more physical illnesses, particularly stress-associated disorders; and a greater propensity to exhibit aggressive and violent behavior, sometimes carrying violent and violence-tolerant roles to their adult relationships. Studies have also noted that children are affected to varying degrees by witnessing violence in the home, and each child should be assessed on an independent basis. Accordingly, the general assembly determines that it is in the best interests of the children of the state of Colorado for the courts to advise the parents or guardians of children affected by domestic violence about the availability of resources and services and for such persons to be provided with information concerning the resources and services available to aid in the positive development of their children. It is the intent of the general assembly that such information would increase the awareness of the possible effects of domestic violence on children in the home, while providing the parents and legal guardians of these children with a comprehensive resource of available children's services as well as potential financial resources to assist parents and legal guardians seeking to retain services for their children affected by domestic violence.

        The general assembly recognizes research that documents the negative impact divorce and separation can have on children when the parents continue the marital conflict, expose the children to this conflict, or place the children in the middle of the conflict or when one parent drops out of the child's life. This research establishes that children of divorce or separation may exhibit a decreased ability to function academically, socially, and psychologically because of the stress of the divorce or separation process. The general assembly also finds that, by understanding the process of divorce and its impact on both adults and children, parents can more effectively help and support their children during this time of family reconfiguration. Accordingly, the general assembly finds that it is in the best interests of children to authorize courts to establish, or contract with providers for the establishment of, educational programs for separating, divorcing, and divorced parents with minor children. The intent of these programs is to educate parents about the divorce process and its impact on adults and children and to teach coparenting skills and strategies so that parents may continue to parent their children in a cooperative manner.

The educational program shall inform parents about the divorce process and its impact on adults and children and shall teach parents coparenting skills and strategies so that they may continue to parent their children in a cooperative manner. Any such educational program shall be administered and monitored by the implementing judicial district or districts and shall be paid for by the participating parents in accordance with each parent's ability to pay.

        Legislative declaration. While co-parenting is not appropriate in all circumstances following dissolution of marriage or legal separation, the general assembly finds and declares that, in most circumstances, it is in the best interest of all parties to encourage frequent and continuing contact between each parent and the minor children of the marriage after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage. In order to effectuate this goal when appropriate, the general assembly urges parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child-rearing and to encourage the love, affection, and contact between the children and the parents.

           (I) Whether one of the parties has committed an act of child abuse or neglect as defined in section 18-6-401, C.R.S., or as defined under the law of any state, which factor must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the court finds that one of the parties has committed child abuse or neglect, then it shall not be in the best interests of the child to allocate mutual decision-making with respect to any issue over the objection of the other party or the legal representative of the child.

At any time, the court may require a subsequent evaluation to determine whether additional treatment is necessary. If the court awards parenting time to a party who has been ordered to participate in domestic violence treatment, the court may order the party to obtain a report from the treatment provider concerning the party's progress in treatment and addressing any ongoing safety concerns regarding the party's parenting time.

          Annotator's note.
         </b>
         Since § 14-10-124 is similar to repealed § 46-1-5 (1)(b), C.R.S. 1963, § 46-1-5, CRS 53, and CSA, C. 56, § 8, relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.

          Trial court should have applied the standard for an original determination of visitation, which is based on the best interests of the child,
         </b>
         where the order awarding parenting time to stepfather was a temporary order. Although paternity decree operated as a final order and permanent allocation as to paternity and custody, its award of parenting time to stepfather was a temporary order because the parties had not reached an agreement on a permanent parenting time schedule but had agreed to maintain the interim schedule and work toward a permanent one. The fact that the parties adhered to the schedule for nearly three years did not change the nature of the order. In re C.T.G., 179 P.3d 213 (Colo. App. 2007).

          Trial court erred by failing to afford parents their due process rights because court did not presume parents were acting in the child's best interests,
         </b>
         but instead placed upon them the burden of demonstrating that visitation with stepfather would endanger the child; the court did not find that "special circumstances" existed which justified the intrusion on the parents' rights; and the court did not apply a clear and convincing evidence standard. In re C.T.G., 179 P.3d 213 (Colo. App. 2007).

          Even if stepfather was a psychological parent, stepfather failed to present evidence to rebut presumption that parents were acting in their child's best interests
         </b>
         by terminating stepfather's visitation and failed to show or proffer evidence of special circumstances that would justify trial court's order allowing visitation against the wishes of the parents. The visitation order infringed upon parents' fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their child. In re C.T.G., 179 P.3d 213 (Colo. App. 2007).

          The intrinsic threat of emotional harm to child from curtailment or termination of relationship with psychological parent

This section identifies non-exclusive statutory factors courts should consider in determining the best interests of the child. In re Reese, 227 P.3d 900 (Colo. App. 2010).

         Natural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the companionship, care, custody, and management of their children. This fundamental liberty interest gives rise to a presumption that the best interests of the child will be furthered by a fit natural parent. People ex rel. A.M.K., 68 P.3d 563 (Colo. App. 2003).

        <p>
         This presumption may be rebutted

         In an initial determination to allocate parental responsibilities, a court has no statutory authority to order a parent to live in a specific location.

          III. TENDER YEARS DOCTRINE.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         In its concern for children, particularly those of tender years, the supreme court formerly enunciated guides
         
         for trial courts in the disposition of controversies regarding their custody. Songster v. Songster, 150
         <cite class="co_code">
          Colo. 466
         </cite>
         , 374 P.2d 197 (1962).
        </p>
        <p>
         Formerly, courts did not deprive the mother of the custody of her children of tender years,
         
         unless it was clearly shown that she was so unfit a person as to endanger the welfare of the minors. Hayes v. Hayes, 134
         <cite class="co_code">
          Colo. 315

        </p>
        <p>
         A mother's love, care, and affection for a child of tender years were considered the most unselfish of all factors in human relations,
         
         and a child was not to be deprived thereof unless for a very good reason, founded on lack of moral fitness and proper home surroundings. Hayes v. Hayes, 134

          Court's undue emphasis on motherly instincts reversible error.

         Court's undue emphasis on "motherly instincts" constituted a presumption that the mother was better able to serve the best interests of the child because of her sex and was both an abuse of discretion and reversible error. In re Miller, 670 P.2d 819 (Colo. App. 1983).

         Although the court states that one of its considerations in making a custody award is a belief in the importance of a "meaningful relationship" between a father and son, the remark does not rise to the level of a presumption where the court makes sufficient findings unrelated to parental gender to support the award.

         The court could make an order for the care and custody of minor children, and make provision for their maintenance,

        <p>
         Motions for determination of custody of children are different in kind from actions to enforce wholly personal rights as property or alimony,

         While it is not necessary that a trial court make specific findings on each and every factor included in this section, there must be some indication in the record that the trial court considered such of those factors as were pertinent, and the findings thereon must be sufficient to enable this court to determine on what ground the trial court reached its decision, and whether that decision was supported by competent evidence.

         The purpose of the legislation providing for the preparation and filing of reports

        in custody proceedings is to make the information contained therein available to assist the court in determining what is in the best interest of the children concerned. Pacheco v. Pacheco, 38 Colo. App. 181, 554 P.2d 720 (1976).

        The purpose of the legislation providing for court assistants in the capacity of investigators of domestic relations cases to assist the court in the transaction of the judicial business of said court
        
        was obviously to assist the court and not to replace it. The general assembly would have no power to substitute an investigator for a judge, and neither would such legislation authorize a trial court to deny to the parties any of the usual attributes of a fair trial in open court upon due notice.

        The act of the general assembly (§ 46-1-5 (7), C.R.S. 1963), which purported to authorize the trial court to call upon the probation department for a report concerning "the ability of each party to serve the best interest of the child",
        
        and further directing that "Each report shall be considered by the court" could not be so construed as to deny due process which includes the right to be heard in open court and to have a determination of issues based upon competent evidence offered by persons who submit themselves to cross examination.

        A probation officer, or other persons, who have been designated to investigate and report to the court in custody hearings
        
        matters involving the ability or fitness of parents to best serve the interests of their children, are subject to examination as witnesses concerning matters contained in their reports. Saucerman v. Saucerman, 170

        However, touching upon matters related to them in confidence, the trial court should preliminarily rule in each instance
        
        what matters are in fact confidential, and whether the public interest requires the confidence to be preserved, and no examination of the officer should be permitted with respect to such confidential matters. Saucerman v. Saucerman, 170

        Where the trial court received in evidence the investigative reports of welfare and health department employees
        
        in reference to conditions found in the respective homes of the two contestants, and in reference to the psychological effects living with the father or the mother might have on one of the children, and the record indicated that at one hearing after the reports were filed the individuals who made the reports were either in court or could have been made available to the parties for cross-examination, there was no unfairness nor a denial of due process.

         Opportunity to test report's reliability and offer evidence exists.
        </b>
        Because any party has the right to call for cross-examination of the investigator and any person he has consulted, and because the investigator's file is available to counsel, ample opportunity exists for a party to test the reliability of the report and to offer evidence in explanation of or to disprove any statements or conclusions based on hearsay. Pacheco v. Pacheco, 38 Colo. App. 181, 554 P.2d 720 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In making an order changing the custody of children, the trial court is actually making the decision,
        
        though such order is based on the recommendations of a psychiatrist and welfare personnel whose reports constitute nothing more than recommendations. Aylor v. Aylor, 173
        <cite class="co_code">

         Court did not improperly utilize an investigative report
        </b>
        made by an officer of the juvenile probation department in arriving at its decision relative to custody, for while it is true that the investigative report was not formally offered and received in evidence, the report was made a part of the record and had been furnished previously to both parties, and although she did not choose to do so, the wife had the right to call and examine the author of the report. Rayer v. Rayer, 32 Colo. App. 400, 512 P.2d 637 (1973); In re Lorenzo, 721 P.2d 155 (Colo. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reports simply furnish specific information of a specialized nature for aid and assistance to the trial court,
        
        but in the final analysis the judge makes the decision, and whatever recommendations may be made to the judge, be they by experts or counsel, are merely recommendations and nothing more. Aylor v. Aylor, 173

        Where objections and exceptions were filed to the report of the probation department, since it was a hearsay document, if the conclusions reached therein were objected to by either party,
        
        it would be necessary that competent evidence, upon which the conclusions were based, be presented in open court. Anderson v. Anderson, 167

         Waiver of objections to admission of report.
        </b>
        Unless a party notifies the court and the opposing party within 10 days after receipt of a copy of the report (or if a copy has not been received at least 10 days prior to the hearing day, then at or prior to the commencement of the hearing at which the report may be used) that he intends to object to the admission of the report on the grounds of noncompliance with the 10-day rule or the hearsay nature of the report, any such objections are waived.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a copy of the report was received by counsel a reasonable time prior to the hearing and no objection was made thereto until after the commencement of the hearing, objections as to hearsay and the 10-day rule were waived. Pacheco v. Pacheco, 38 Colo. App. 181, 554 P.2d 720 (1976).

        <b>
         Effect of valid objection.
        </b>
        If a valid objection is made within the period specified above, then, on motion of either party or of the court, the court shall grant a reasonable continuance of the custody hearing date in order that the parties may obtain appropriate testimony. Pacheco v. Pacheco, 38 Colo. App. 181, 554 P.2d 720 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in relying upon the probation report where it afforded no opportunity for the husband to offer evidence in explanation thereof,
        
        or to disprove any conclusions based on hearsay that were contained therein. Anderson v. Anderson, 167
        <cite class="co_code">

       <p>
        It was not prejudicial error for the trial court to have received in evidence the hearsay reports of the case worker of the welfare department
        
        in custody proceedings, since the nature of the "report" was such that the father could not possibly have been prejudiced by anything contained therein, and furthermore, it affirmatively appeared from the court's decree that it did not in any manner enter into the court's thinking to the prejudice of the father.

        <b>
         Effect of noncompliance.

        Noncompliance with the 10-day rule merely prohibits the court from proceeding with a hearing wherein the report can be considered absent consent of or waiver by the parties. Pacheco v. Pacheco, 38 Colo. App. 181, 554 P.2d 720 (1976).

        <b>
         The language that "the court shall" order an evaluation

        This section applies to both the determination of parenting time and the allocation of parental decision-making when a court is asked to rule on the intended relocation of one of the parents. Because the statute is mandatory, a trial court must order an evaluation pursuant to this section when requested by either party when one party seeks to relocate.

         This section does not permit the parenting coordinator to make decisions or resolve disputes that the parents are unable to resolve.
        </b>
        A grant of decision-making authority to the parenting coordinator is contrary to subsection (3). In re Dauwe, 148 P.3d 282 (Colo. App. 2006).

         This section and § 13-22-313 are in conflict and cannot be harmonized with respect to the standards for the appointment of a parenting coordinator if abuse is alleged by one parent by the other.
        </b>
        Although § 13-22-313 bars the court from referring a case to any ancillary form of alternative dispute resolution if one of the parties claims abuse by the other party, under this section, a mere claim of abuse by one parent is insufficient to bar the appointment of a parenting coordinator. Even documented evidence of domestic violence does not automatically bar such an appointment. Rather, the court is required only to consider the effect of the evidence on the parties' ability to engage in parenting coordination. In re Rozzi, 190 P.3d 815 (Colo. App. 2008).

        With the consent of all parties, the court may appoint an arbitrator to resolve disputes between the parties concerning the parties' minor or dependent children, including but not limited to parenting time, nonrecurring adjustments to child support, and disputed parental decisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all awards entered by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to this section shall be in writing. The arbitrator's award shall be effective immediately upon entry and shall continue in effect until vacated by the arbitrator pursuant to part 2 of article 22 of title 13, C.R.S., modified or corrected by the arbitrator pursuant to part 2 of article 22 of title 13, C.R.S., or modified by the court pursuant to a de novo hearing under subsection (2) of this section.

        Any party may apply to have the arbitrator's award vacated, modified, or corrected pursuant to part 2 of article 22 of title 13, C.R.S., or may move the court to modify the arbitrator's award pursuant to a de novo hearing concerning such award by filing a motion for hearing no later than thirty-five days after the date of the award. In circumstances in which a party moves for a de novo hearing by the court, if the court, in its discretion based on the pleadings filed, grants the motion and the court substantially upholds the decision of the arbitrator, the party that requested the de novo hearing shall be ordered to pay the fees and costs of the other party and the fees of the arbitrator incurred in responding to the application or motion unless the court finds that it would be manifestly unjust.

         While issues of child custody, visitation, child support, and other matters relating to the children are arbitrable, the trial court retains jurisdiction
        </b>
        to decide all issues relating to the children de novo upon the request of either party. In re Popack, 998 P.2d 464 (Colo. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Because there was no arbitration award issued pursuant to this section,
        </b>
        mother was not entitled to a trial de novo. Although the order of appointment clothed the parenting coordinator with arbitration power, the court found no arbitration occurred. In re Kniskern, 80 P.3d 939 (Colo. App. 2003).

        <b>
         Trial court is not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on an arbitrator's request for payment of fees.
        </b>
        Although the necessity or reasonableness of an arbitrator's fees may be subject to dispute, the parties' due process rights to litigate the scope of the services and the amounts requested are well protected by written motion practice. In re Eggert, 53 P.3d 794 (Colo. App. 2002).

        <b>
         Requests for de novo review must be filed within 30 days after the arbitrator's ruling.
        </b>
        This conclusion is consistent with the plain meaning of the statute since it specifically refers to the Uniform Arbitration Act of 1975 that creates the 30-day time frame. In re Schmitt, 89 P.3d 510 (Colo. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Request for de novo review of parenting time order must be timely filed.
        
        While the Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act takes precedence over other laws, including those applicable to alternative dispute resolution, this section requires a party to request a de novo hearing on an arbitration award no later than 35 days after the date of the arbitration award. Court erred in setting permanent orders hearing on parenting issues. In re Rivera,
        <cite class="co_code">
         2013 COA 21

        , 300 P.3d 994.
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute does not grant an absolute right to a de novo hearing.
        
        Plain language of statute gives the court discretion to grant or deny a party's motion for such a hearing. In re Vanderborgh,
        <cite class="co_code">

        Arbitration award must be confirmed by the court in order for the award to be enforced as a court order through contempt proceedings.
        
        Although the arbitration order was effective immediately, neither spouse petitioned the district court to confirm the award. An arbitrator's award is not a "court order" for purposes of the contempt statute. In re Leverett,

        Court must hold hearing on subsection (4) motion to restrict parenting time within 14 days if motion complies with the "particularity" requirement of C.R.C.P. 7(b)(1).
       </b>
       Motion must identify with specificity the grounds in support of it and the reasons relief is warranted. The court may not resolve the motion without a hearing based on the court's assessment of the credibility of the allegations or proof. The court in In re Slowinski, 199 P.3d 48, (Colo. App. 2008), applied the wrong standard for review of subsection (4) motions. In re Wollert, 2020 CO 47, 464 P.3d 703.

         The court did not abuse its discretion in adopting an agreement and modifying the parenting time
        </b>
        despite the fact that the agreement was not reduced to writing or signed. This section allows the trial court to modify parenting time whenever doing so would be in the child's best interests. In re Barker, 251 P.3d 591 (Colo. App. 2010).

       </p>
       <p>
        Parenting time issues on appeal are moot because the parties' eighteen-year-old child is no longer subject to the dissolution court's jurisdiction to allocate parenting time and the court's existing parenting time order that father challenges is no longer enforceable as to her.

        <b>
         Determining whether to apply the best-interests standard or the endangerment standard
        </b>
        may involve inquiry into both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of the proposed change to parenting time, as well as the reason or reasons advanced for the change. In re West, 94 P.3d 1248 (Colo. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        While endangerment will necessarily encompass best interests, few best interests arguments will show endangerment. In re West, 94 P.3d 1248 (Colo. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Before parenting time may be completely eliminated, court must consider both the endangerment standard and the best interests of the child.
        </b>
        Although trial court may allocate parenting time substantially to one parent under the endangerment standard, it may not completely deny other parent parenting time under the best interests standard without express consideration of whether doing so is the least detrimental alternative. In re Hatton, 160 P.3d 326 (Colo. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A reduction in parenting time resulting from the other parent's relocation with the child is not to be construed as a restriction requiring the court to apply the endangerment standard set forth in subsection (1)(b).

         This section eliminates the In re Francis test in relocation cases, including the presumption in favor of the majority-time parent.
        </b>
        The trial court, however, abused its discretion in applying this section to the facts of this case, and such abuse of discretion unconstitutionally infringed upon mother's right to travel. In re Ciesluk, 113 P.3d 135 (Colo. 2005).

         The well-being of child rather than reward or punishment of parent
        </b>
        ought to guide every aspect of a custody determination, including visitation. In re McGee, 44 Colo. App. 330, 613 P.2d 348 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the best interests of a minor child, a trial court may deny visitation rights.

       <p>
        <b>
         Both parents' constitutional interests, the right to travel and the right to the care and control of the child, as well as the best interests of the child, will be best protected if each parent shares equally in the burden of demonstrating how the child's best interests will be affected by a proposed relocation.
        </b>
        In re Ciesluk, 113 P.3d 135 (Colo. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        This procedure applies to a parent who shares parenting time equally with the other parent but who desires to relocate with the child and to modify parenting time so as to become the majority time parent. In re DeZalia, 151 P.3d 647 (Colo. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is incumbent upon the trial court to consider all the relevant factors to determine what arrangement will serve the child's best interests.
        
        Though the best interests of the child are of primary importance in making this determination, they do not automatically overcome the constitutional interests of the parents, which must be weighed against each other in the best-interests analysis. In re Ciesluk, 113 P.3d 135 (
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 2005
        </cite>
        ); In re Newell, 192 P.3d 529 (Colo. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Presumption that parent has "first and prior" right to custody of children is not implicated when dispute is between mother and father and not mother and stepmother.
        </b>
        As between two fit parents, duty of court is to weigh the wishes of both to determine what is in the best interests of the children. In re DePalma, 176 P.3d 829 (Colo. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where a parent's role as day-to-day caregiver of a minor is relinquished
        </b>
        through contested or uncontested judicial proceedings and with no indication by the court that the relinquishment was intended to be temporary, the parent has enjoyed and exercised his or her fundamental rights. In re M.J.K., 200 P.3d 1106 (Colo. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Subsequent application of the statutory standards for terminating guardianships or modifying allocations of parental responsibility,
        </b>
        which standards certainly allow a court to consider the relationship between the biological parent and the child, does not violate the parent's constitutional rights. In re M.J.K., 200 P.3d 1106 (Colo. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        To hold otherwise would effectively afford a parent who relinquishes his or her day-to-day parenting responsibilities through judicial processes a substantial, if not automatic, right to terminate a guardianship or modify an allocation of parental rights with no regard for the perhaps significant impact on his or her children. In re M.J.K., 200 P.3d 1106 (Colo. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where father wished to delegate his parenting time to his new wife while deployed in Iraq, the court did not err by considering first the presumption that father was acting in the best interests of the children because father was not attempting to impermissibly establish parental rights for his new wife over the established parental rights of the children's mother. In re DePalma, 176 P.3d 829 (Colo. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Special weight" must be given to parent's motion to modify parental responsibilities where sole decision-making and primary residential custody is with non-parents.
        
        Rather than presuming that the existing order remains in effect, there is a presumption in favor of modifying the order at the parent's request. In re B.R.D.,
        <cite class="co_code">
         2012 COA 63
        </cite>
        , 280 P.3d 78.
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden shifts from parent to non-parents in modification of parental responsibilities proceeding.
        
        Non-parents must rebut presumption by showing: (1) That the proposed modification is not in the child's best interests and that the present allocation of parental responsibilities does not endanger the child; and (2) that the present allocation of parental responsibilities is in the child's best interests. In re B.R.D.,
        <cite class="co_code">
         2012 COA 63
        </cite>
        , 280 P.3d 78.
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of proof for non-parents who have sole decision-making authority and primary residential custody is a preponderance of the evidence in modification action brought by parent
        
        who consented to the initial custody orders. Court denying parent's modification order must make findings of fact identifying appropriate special factors upon which it relies. In re B.R.D.,

         Trial court abused its discretion when it prematurely concluded that it would be in the child's best interests to remain in close proximity to both parents.
        </b>
        The effect of this conclusion was to create a presumption in father's favor contrary to the legislative intent of subsection (2)(c). In re Ciesluk, 113 P.3d 135 (Colo. 2005).

        It is against the policy of the law in Colorado to permit the removal of a child from the jurisdiction,

        In determining what was for the best welfare of a child of tender years, the courts considered not only food, clothing, shelter, care, education, and environment,
        
        but also kept in mind that every such child was entitled to the love, nurture, advice, and training of both father and mother, and to deny to the child an opportunity to know, associate with, love, and be loved by either parent may have been a more serious ill than to refuse him in some part those things which money can buy.

As decisions regarding parenting time are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court, it follows that it is within the discretion of the trial court to determine the weight to be given to each relevant factor in making a decision regarding the effect relocation of the primary residential parent and the child would have on the parenting time of the other parent.

Although paternity decree operated as a final order and permanent allocation as to paternity and custody, its award of parenting time to stepfather was a temporary order because the parties had not reached an agreement on a permanent parenting time schedule but had agreed to maintain the interim schedule and work toward a permanent one.

         The plain language of this section requires,

        upon the filing of a motion to clarify visitation, that the court deny the motion, conduct a hearing, or refer the matter to mediation. Where cross motions of mother and father sought to modify father's visitation, the trial court erred in granting the father's motion and denying the mother's motion. In re Williams-Off, 867 P.2d 205 (Colo. App. 1993).

       <p>
        <b>
         The trial court abused its discretion by conditioning child support on an anticipated lack of parenting time

        when mother was planning to move to Singapore with children and father was entitled to "reasonable and liberal" parenting time. In re Hoffman, 878 P.2d 103 (Colo. App. 1994).

         If a parenting time dispute gives rise to a tort claim for damages, that claim must be brought, not in the dissolution court (which is authorized to award only attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses), but in a court that has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter.
        </b>
        Therefore, the court erred in dismissing father's tort claims under C.R.C.P. 12(b)(1). The court had subject matter jurisdiction over those claims, even though the claims arose from a dispute over parenting time. Marshall v. Marshall, 183 P.3d 699 (Colo. App. 2008).

       <p>
        District court erred in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce an out-of-state parenting time order.

        If a motion for modification of a custody decree or a decree allocating decision-making responsibility has been filed, whether or not it was granted, no subsequent motion may be filed within two years after disposition of the prior motion unless the court decides, on the basis of affidavits, that there is reason to believe that a continuation of the prior decree of custody or order allocating decision-making responsibility may endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair the child's emotional development.

         where the order awarding parenting time to stepfather was a temporary order. Although paternity decree operated as a final order and permanent allocation as to paternity and custody, its award of parenting time to stepfather was a temporary order because the parties had not reached an agreement on a permanent parenting time schedule but had agreed to maintain the interim schedule and work toward a permanent one. The fact that the parties adhered to the schedule for nearly three years did not change the nature of the order. In re C.T.G., 179 P.3d 213 (Colo. App. 2007).

         The public policy of this state as expressed in this section favors retention of the child in a stable atmosphere, thus requiring a strong showing, including a change in circumstances, to justify modification of custody. The protection for children created by this statute would be defeated by allowing parents to determine independently that a lesser showing is sufficient grounds for changing custody arrangements.

       The general assembly finds and declares that in most situations it is important to the healthy development of children that the children spend quality time with both parents. The general assembly further finds that due to dissolution of marriage, legal separation, and children born to single parents, families are often divided. As a result, many children do not have the opportunity to spend the time with both parents that a court may have determined is in their best interests.

       The general assembly further finds that the federal "Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996", Public Law 104-193, allows states to seek grants of federal funds for the establishment and administration of programs and to support and facilitate children's access to time with their noncustodial parent.

       It is the purpose of this article to enhance children's opportunities for access to their parent with whom the child does not reside the majority of the time pursuant to court order in compliance with any orders entered in that regard. To that end, the general assembly hereby determines that it is appropriate for the state to seek the federal grant described in section 391 of the federal "Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996", Public Law 104-193, in order to explore alternative methods by which to support and facilitate a child's access to and time with his or her parent with whom the child does not reside the majority of the time in contested parenting time proceedings.

       Where the issue of alleged fraud in the procurement of the divorce decree either was, or could have been,
       
       litigated in a foreign court where it was raised by the wife, the disposition made of that issue in the sister state was res judicata in Colorado. Petition of Kraudel v. Benner, 148

       The argument that the divorce decree of a sister state should not have been recognized in Colorado because personal service of process was not made upon the wife
       
       in the action was without merit where it was disclosed by the record that she was a resident of the sister state temporarily residing in Colorado at the time of service of process upon her, and service of process upon her was effected by publication and mailing under the practice and procedure of the sister state, and the record showed that she had actual notice of the pendency of the divorce action, but chose not to appear or to contest it.

      It is the declared public policy of this state to maintain desirable marital and family relations; to promote and foster the marriage relationship and reconciliation of estranged spouses; and to take reasonable measures to preserve marriages, particularly where minor children are involved, in the interest of strengthening the family life foundation of our society, and in reducing the economic and social costs to the state resulting from broken homes. In furtherance of this policy, it is the purpose of this article to make competent marriage counseling services available through the district courts of the state to spouses involved in domestic difficulties.

    <p>
     <b>
      PREFATORY NOTE
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), revisits the problem of the interstate child almost thirty years after the Conference promulgated the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA). The UCCJEA accomplishes two major purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
     First, it revises the law on child custody jurisdiction in light of federal enactments and almost thirty years of inconsistent case law. Part 2 of this Act provides clearer standards for which States can exercise original jurisdiction over a child custody determination. It also, for the first time, enunciates a standard of continuing jurisdiction and clarifies modification jurisdiction. Other aspects of the part harmonize the law on simultaneous proceedings, clean hands, and forum non conveniens.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second, this Act provides in Part 3 for a remedial process to enforce interstate child custody and visitation determinations. In doing so, it brings a uniform procedure to the law of interstate enforcement that is currently producing inconsistent results. In many respects, this Act accomplishes for custody and visitation determinations the same uniformity that has occurred in interstate child support with the promulgation of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA).
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Revision of Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The UCCJA was adopted as law in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. A number of adoptions, however, significantly departed from the original text. In addition, almost thirty years of litigation since the promulgation of the UCCJA produced substantial inconsistency in interpretation by state courts. As a result, the goals of the UCCJA were rendered unobtainable in many cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1980, the federal government enacted the Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. § 1738A, to address the interstate custody jurisdictional problems that continued to exist after the adoption of the UCCJA. The PKPA mandates that state authorities give full faith and credit to other states' custody determinations, so long as those determinations were made in conformity with the provisions of the PKPA. The PKPA provisions regarding bases for jurisdiction, restrictions on modifications, preclusion of simultaneous proceedings, and notice requirements are similar to those in the UCCJA. There are, however, some significant differences. For example, the PKPA authorizes continuing exclusive jurisdiction in the original decree State so long as one parent or the child remains there and that State has continuing jurisdiction under its own law. The UCCJA did not directly address this issue. To further complicate the process, the PKPA partially incorporates state UCCJA law in its language. The relationship between these two statutes became "technical enough to delight a medieval property lawyer." Homer H. Clark,
     <i>
      Domestic Relations
     </i>
     § 12.5 at 494 (2d ed. 1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     As documented in an extensive study by the American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law,
     <i>
      Obstacles to the Recovery and Return of Parentally Abducted Children
     </i>
     (1993)
     <i>
      (Obstacles Study)
     </i>
     , inconsistency of interpretation of the UCCJA and the technicalities of applying the PKPA, resulted in a loss of uniformity among the States. The Obstacles Study suggested a number of amendments which would eliminate the inconsistent state interpretations and harmonize the UCCJA with the PKPA.
    </p>
    <p>
     The revisions of the jurisdictional aspects of the UCCJA eliminate the inconsistent state interpretations and can be summarized as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      1. Home state priority.
     </b>
     The PKPA prioritizes "home state" jurisdiction by requiring that full faith and credit cannot be given to a child custody determination by a State that exercises initial jurisdiction as a "significant connection state" when there is a "home State." Initial custody determinations based on "significant connections" are not entitled to PKPA enforcement unless there is no home State. The UCCJA, however, specifically authorizes four independent bases of jurisdiction without prioritization. Under the UCCJA, a significant connection custody determination may have to be enforced even if it would be denied enforcement under the PKPA. The UCCJEA prioritizes home state jurisdiction in Section 201.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      2. Clarification of emergency jurisdiction.
     </b>
     There are several problems with the current emergency jurisdiction provision of the UCCJA § 3(a)(3). First, the language of the UCCJA does not specify that emergency jurisdiction may be exercised only to protect the child on a temporary basis until the court with appropriate jurisdiction issues a permanent order. Some courts have interpreted the UCCJA language to so provide. Other courts, however, have held that there is no time limit on a custody determination based on emergency jurisdiction. Simultaneous proceedings and conflicting custody orders have resulted from these different interpretations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second, the emergency jurisdiction provisions predated the widespread enactment of state domestic violence statutes. Those statutes are often invoked to keep one parent away from the other parent and the children when there is a threat of violence. Whether these situations are sufficient to invoke the emergency jurisdiction provision of the UCCJA has been the subject of some confusion since the emergency jurisdiction provision does not specifically refer to violence directed against the parent of the child or against a sibling of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
     The UCCJEA contains a separate section on emergency jurisdiction at Section 14-13-204 which addresses these issues.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      3. Exclusive continuing jurisdiction for the State that entered the decree.
     </b>
     The failure of the UCCJA to clearly enunciate that the decree-granting State retains exclusive continuing jurisdiction to modify a decree has resulted in two major problems. First, different interpretations of the UCCJA on continuing jurisdiction have produced conflicting custody decrees. States also have different interpretations as to how long continuing jurisdiction lasts. Some courts have held that modification jurisdiction continues until the last contestant leaves the State, regardless of how many years the child has lived outside the State or how tenuous the child's connections to the State have become. Other courts have held that continuing modification jurisdiction ends as soon as the child has established a new home State, regardless of how significant the child's connections to the decree State remain. Still other States distinguish between custody orders and visitation orders. This divergence of views leads to simultaneous proceedings and conflicting custody orders.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second problem arises when it is necessary to determine whether the State with continuing jurisdiction has relinquished it. There should be a clear basis to determine when that court has relinquished jurisdiction. The UCCJA provided no guidance on this issue. The ambiguity regarding whether a court has declined jurisdiction can result in one court improperly exercising jurisdiction because it erroneously believes that the other court has declined jurisdiction. This caused simultaneous proceedings and conflicting custody orders. In addition, some courts have declined jurisdiction after only informal contact between courts with no opportunity for the parties to be heard. This raised significant due process concerns. The UCCJEA addresses these issues in Sections 14-13-110, 14-13-202, and 14-13-206.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      4. Specification of what custody proceedings are covered.
     </b>
     The definition of custody proceeding in the UCCJA is ambiguous. States have rendered conflicting decisions regarding certain types of proceedings. There is no general agreement on whether the UCCJA applies to neglect, abuse, dependency, wardship, guardianship, termination of parental rights, and protection from domestic violence proceedings. The UCCJEA includes a sweeping definition that, with the exception of adoption, includes virtually all cases that can involve custody of or visitation with a child as a "custody determination."

      5. Role of "Best Interests."
     </b>
     The jurisdictional scheme of the UCCJA was designed to promote the best interests of the children whose custody was at issue by discouraging parental abduction and providing that, in general, the State with the closest connections to, and the most evidence regarding, a child should decide that child's custody. The "best interest" language in the jurisdictional sections of the UCCJA was not intended to be an invitation to address the merits of the custody dispute in the jurisdictional determination or to otherwise provide that "best interests" considerations should override jurisdictional determinations or provide an additional jurisdictional basis.
    </p>
    <p>
     The UCCJEA eliminates the term "best interests" in order to clearly distinguish between the jurisdictional standards and the substantive standards relating to custody and visitation of children.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      6. Other Changes.
     </b>
     This draft also makes a number of additional amendments to the UCCJA. Many of these changes were made to harmonize the provisions of this Act with those of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. One of the policy bases underlying this Act is to make uniform the law of interstate family proceedings to the extent possible, given the very different jurisdictional foundations. It simplifies the life of the family law practitioner when the same or similar provisions are found in both Acts.

     <b>
      Enforcement Provisions
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the major purposes of the revision of the UCCJA was to provide a remedy for interstate visitation and custody cases. As with child support, state borders have become one of the biggest obstacles to enforcement of custody and visitation orders. If either parent leaves the State where the custody determination was made, the other parent faces considerable difficulty in enforcing the visitation and custody provisions of the decree. Locating the child, making service of process, and preventing adverse modification in a new forum all present problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is currently no uniform method of enforcing custody and visitation orders validly entered in another State. As documented by the
     <i>
      Obstacles Study
     </i>
     , despite the fact that both the UCCJA and the PKPA direct the enforcement of visitation and custody orders entered in accordance with mandated jurisdictional prerequisites and due process, neither act provides enforcement procedures or remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the
     <i>
      Obstacles Study
     </i>
     pointed out, the lack of specificity in enforcement procedures has resulted in the law of enforcement evolving differently in different jurisdictions. In one State, it might be common practice to file a Motion to Enforce or a Motion to Grant Full Faith and Credit to initiate an enforcement proceeding. In another State, a Writ of Habeas Corpus or a Citation for Contempt might be commonly used. In some States, Mandamus and Prohibition also may be utilized. All of these enforcement procedures differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. While many States tend to limit considerations in enforcement proceedings to whether the court which issued the decree had jurisdiction to make the custody determination, others broaden the considerations to scrutiny of whether enforcement would be in the best interests of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lack of uniformity complicates the enforcement process in several ways: (1) It increases the costs of the enforcement action in part because the services of more than one lawyer may be required one in the original forum and one in the State where enforcement is sought; (2) It decreases the certainty of outcome; (3) It can turn enforcement into a long and drawn out procedure. A parent opposed to the provisions of a visitation determination may be able to delay implementation for many months, possibly even years, thereby frustrating not only the other parent, but also the process that led to the issuance of the original court order.
    </p>
    <p>
     The provisions of Part 3 provide several remedies for the enforcement of a custody determination. First, there is a simple procedure for registering a custody determination in another State. This will allow a party to know in advance whether that State will recognize the party's custody determination. This is extremely important in estimating the risk of the child's non-return when the child is sent on visitation. The provision should prove to be very useful in international custody cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second, the Act provides a swift remedy along the lines of habeas corpus. Time is extremely important in visitation and custody cases. If visitation rights cannot be enforced quickly, they often cannot be enforced at all. This is particularly true if there is a limited time within which visitation can be exercised such as may be the case when one parent has been granted visitation during the winter or spring holiday period. Without speedy consideration and resolution of the enforcement of such visitation rights, the ability to visit may be lost entirely. Similarly, a custodial parent must be able to obtain prompt enforcement when the noncustodial parent refuses to return a child at the end of authorized visitation, particularly when a summer visitation extension will infringe on the school year. A swift enforcement mechanism is desirable for violations of both custody and visitation provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The scope of the enforcing court's inquiry is limited to the issue of whether the decree court had jurisdiction and complied with due process in rendering the original custody decree. No further inquiry is necessary because neither Part 2 nor the PKPA allows an enforcing court to modify a custody determination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Third, the enforcing court will be able to utilize an extraordinary remedy. If the enforcing court is concerned that the parent, who has physical custody of the child, will flee or harm the child, a warrant to take physical possession of the child is available.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, there is a role for public authorities, such as prosecutors, in the enforcement process. Their involvement will encourage the parties to abide by the terms of the custody determination. If the parties know that public authorities and law enforcement officers are available to help in securing compliance with custody determinations, the parties may be deterred from interfering with the exercise of rights established by court order.
    </p>
    <p>
     The involvement of public authorities will also prove more effective in remedying violations of custody determinations. Most parties do not have the resources to enforce a custody determination in another jurisdiction. The availability of the public authorities as an enforcement agency will help ensure that this remedy can be made available regardless of income level. In addition, the public authorities may have resources to draw on that are unavailable to the average litigant.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act does not authorize the public authorities to be involved in the action leading up to the making of the custody determination, except when requested by the court, when there is a violation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, or when the person holding the child has violated a criminal statute. The Act does not mandate that public authorities be involved in all cases. Not all States, or local authorities, have the funds necessary for an effective custody and visitation enforcement program.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The UCCJA did not contain a definition of "child." The definition here is taken from the PKPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "child-custody determination" now closely tracks the PKPA definition. It encompasses any judgment, decree or other order which provides for the custody of, or visitation with, a child, regardless of local terminology, including such labels as "managing conservatorship" or "parenting plan."
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "child-custody proceeding" has been expanded from the comparable definition in the UCCJA. These listed proceedings have generally been determined to be the type of proceeding to which the UCCJA and PKPA are applicable. The list of examples removes any controversy about the types of proceedings where a custody determination can occur. Proceedings that affect access to the child are subject to this Act. The inclusion of proceedings related to protection from domestic violence is necessary because in some States domestic violence proceedings may affect custody of and visitation with a child. Juvenile delinquency or proceedings to confer contractual rights are not "custody proceedings" because they do not relate to civil aspects of access to a child. While a determination of paternity is covered under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the custody and visitation aspects of paternity cases are custody proceedings. Cases involving the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction have not been included at this point because custody of the child is not determined in a proceeding under the International Child Abductions Remedies Act. Those proceedings are specially included in the part 3 enforcement process.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Commencement" has been included in the definitions as a replacement for the term "pending" found in the UCCJA. Its inclusion simplifies some of the simultaneous proceedings provisions of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "home State" has been reworded slightly. No substantive change is intended from the UCCJA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "issuing State" is borrowed from UIFSA. In UIFSA, it refers to the court that issued the support or parentage order. Here, it refers to the State, or the court, which made the custody determination that is sought to be enforced. It is used primarily in part 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "person" has been added to ensure that the provisions of this Act apply when the State is the moving party in a custody proceeding or has legal custody of a child. The definition of "person" is the one that is mandated for all Uniform Acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "person acting as a parent" has been slightly redefined. It has been broadened from the definition in the UCCJA to include a person who has acted as a parent for a significant period of time prior to the filing of the custody proceeding as well as a person who currently has physical custody of the child. In addition, a person acting as a parent must either have legal custody or claim a right to legal custody under the law of this State. The reference to the law of this State means that a court determines the issue of whether someone is a "person acting as a parent" under its own law. This reaffirms the traditional view that a court in a child custody case applies its own substantive law. The court does not have to undertake a choice-of-law analysis to determine whether the individual who is claiming to be a person acting as a parent has standing to seek custody of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "tribe" is the one mandated for use in Uniform Acts. Should a State choose to apply this Act to tribal adjudications, this definition should be enacted as well as the entirety of Section 104. (Note: Section 104 of the Act deals with the application to Indian tribes. Colorado did not adopt this section of the Act.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "contestant" as has been omitted from this revision. It was defined in the UCCJA § 2(1) as "a person, including a parent, who claims a right to custody or visitation rights with respect to a child." It seems to have served little purpose over the years, and whatever function it once had has been subsumed by state laws on who has standing to seek custody of or visitation with a child. In addition UCCJA § 2(5) of the which defined "decree" and "custody decree" has been eliminated as duplicative of the definition of "custody determination."

       Two proceedings are governed by other acts. Adoption cases are excluded from this Act because adoption is a specialized area which is thoroughly covered by the Uniform Adoption Act (UAA) (1994). Most States either will adopt that Act or will adopt the jurisdictional provisions of that Act. Therefore the jurisdictional provisions governing adoption proceeding are generally found elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are likely to be a number of instances where it will be necessary to apply this Act in an adoption proceeding. For example, if a State adopts the UAA then Section 3-101 of the Act specifically refers in places to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act which will become a reference to this Act. Second, the UAA requires that if an adoption is denied or set aside, the court is to determine the child's custody. UAA § 3-704. Those custody proceedings would be subject to this Act. See Joan Heifetz Hollinger, The Uniform Adoption Act: Reporter's Ruminations, 30 Fam.L.Q. 345 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Children that are the subject of interstate placements for adoption or foster care are governed by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC). The UAA § 2-107 provides that the provisions of the compact, although not jurisdictional, supply the governing rules for all children who are subject to it. As stated in the Comments to that section: "Once a court exercises jurisdiction, the ICPC helps determine the legality of an interstate placement." For a discussion of the relationship between the UCCJA and the ICPC see
       <i>
        J.D.S. v. Franks
       </i>
       , 893 P.2d 732 (Ariz. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings pertaining to the authorization of emergency medical care for children are outside the scope of this Act since they are not custody determinations. All States have procedures which allow the State to temporarily supersede parental authority for purposes of emergency medical procedures. Those provisions will govern without regard to this Act.

        Specific language of statute precludes UCCJEA application to failed adoption proceedings,

       In case involving failed adoption and resulting litigation with mother located in Missouri, a UCCJA state, and child and potential adoptive parents residing in Colorado, a UCCJEA state, it was proper for Colorado court to exercise jurisdiction
       
       over question of custody of the child after Missouri court dismissed petition for adoption and ordered child to be returned to the mother's custody for the following reasons: (1) Under provisions of the UCCJA, a court of a second state can exercise jurisdiction after an initial custody decree has been entered if the court of the first state declined to exercise jurisdiction; (2) Missouri court's failure to determine custody of child according to child's best interest was akin to declining to exercise jurisdiction over custody issues, and Colorado was therefore not obligated to give full faith and credit to Missouri court's order concerning custody of the child; (3) in both Missouri and Colorado, there are provisions that authorize the court, subsequent to a failed adoption, to provide for the care and custody of the child according to the child's best interests, including a custody request from a nonparent; (4) the UCCJEA's exclusion of adoption was based on the expectation that states enacting the UCCJEA would adopt the Uniform Adoption Act, and the Uniform Adoption Act contemplates that when an adoption fails after a child has been with the prospective parents for a period of time, the court must take into account the best interests of the child in making determinations about continuing placement; and (5) Missouri does not retain jurisdiction over the case under the interstate compact on the placement of children (ICPC) since under the facts of the case, there was no proper request pursuant to the ICPC to return the child to Missouri.

       The provisions of this Act have international application to child custody proceedings and determinations of other countries. Another country will be treated as if it were a State of the United States for purposes of applying parts 1 and 2 of this Act. Custody determinations of other countries will be enforced if the facts of the case indicate that jurisdiction was in substantial compliance with the requirements of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this section, the term "child-custody determination" should be interpreted to include proceedings relating to custody or analogous institutions of the other country. See generally, Article 3 of The Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. 35 I.L.M. 1391 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court of this State may refuse to apply this Act when the child custody law of the other country violates basic principles relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The same concept is found in of the Section 20 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (return of the child may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms). In applying subsection (3), the court's scrutiny should be on the child custody law of the foreign country and not on other aspects of the other legal system. This Act takes no position on what laws relating to child custody would violate fundamental freedoms. While the provision is a traditional one in international agreements, it is invoked only in the most egregious cases.

       This section is derived from Section 23 of the UCCJA.

       This section authorizes notice and proof of service to be made by any method allowed by either the State which issues the notice or the State where the notice is received. This eliminates the need to specify the type of notice in the Act and therefore the provisions of Section 5 of the UCCJA which specified how notice was to be accomplished were eliminated. The change reflects an approach in this Act to use local law to determine many procedural issues. Thus, service by facsimile is permissible if allowed by local rule in either State. In addition, where special service or notice rules are available for some procedures, in either jurisdiction, they could be utilized under this Act. For example, if a case involves domestic violence and the statute of either State would authorize notice to be served by a peace officer, such service could be used under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although section 14-13-104 requires foreign countries to be treated as States for purposes of this Act, attorneys should be cautioned about service and notice in foreign countries. Countries have their own rules on service which must usually be followed. Attorneys should consult the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, 20 U.S.T. 36, T.I.A.S. 6638 (1965).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section establishes a general principle that participation in a custody proceeding does not, by itself, give the court jurisdiction over any issue for which personal jurisdiction over the individual is required. The term "participate" should be read broadly. For example, if jurisdiction is proper under part 2, a respondent in an original custody determination, or a party in a modification determination, should be able to request custody without this constituting the seeking of affirmative relief that would waive personal jurisdictional objections. Once jurisdiction is proper under part 2, a party should not be placed in the dilemma of choosing between seeking custody or protecting a right not to be subject to a monetary judgment by a court with no other relationship to the party.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is comparable to the immunity provision of UIFSA § 314. A party who is otherwise not subject to personal jurisdiction can appear in a custody proceeding or an enforcement action without being subject to the general jurisdiction of the State by virtue of the appearance. However, if the petitioner would otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of the State, appearing in a custody proceeding or filing an enforcement proceeding will not provide immunity. Thus, if the non-custodial parent moves from the State that decided the custody determination, that parent is still subject to the state's jurisdiction for enforcement of child support if the child or an individual obligee continues to reside there. See UIFSA § 205. If the non-custodial parent returns to enforce the visitation aspects of the custody determination, the State can utilize any appropriate means to collect the back-due child support. However, the situation is different if both parties move from State A after the determination, with the custodial parent and the child establishing a new home State in State B, and the non-custodial parent moving to State C. The non-custodial parent is not, at this point, subject to the jurisdiction of State B for monetary matters. See
       <i>
        Kulko v. Superior Court
       </i>
       , 436 U.S. 84 (1978). If the non-custodial parent comes into State B to enforce the visitation aspects of the determination, the non-custodial parent is not subject to the jurisdiction of State B for those proceedings and issues requiring personal jurisdiction by filing the enforcement action.
      </p>
      <p>
       A party also is immune from service of process during the time in the State for an enforcement action except for those claims for which jurisdiction could be based on contacts other than mere physical presence. Thus, when the non-custodial parent comes into State B to enforce the visitation aspects of the decree, State B cannot acquire jurisdiction over the child support aspects of the decree by serving the non-custodial parent in the State. Cf. UIFSA § 611 (personally serving the obligor in the State of the residence of the obligee is not by itself a sufficient jurisdictional basis to authorize a modification of child support). However, a party who is in this State and subject to the jurisdiction of another State may be served with process to appear in that State, if allowable under the laws of that State.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the Comments to UIFSA § 314 note, the immunity provided by this section is limited. It does not provide immunity for civil litigation unrelated to the enforcement action. For example, a party to an enforcement action is not immune from service regarding a claim that involves an automobile accident occurring while the party is in the State.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section emphasizes the role of judicial communications. It authorizes a court to communicate concerning any proceeding arising under this Act. This includes communication with foreign tribunals and tribal courts. Communication can occur in many different ways such as by telephonic conference and by on-line or other electronic communication. The Act does not preclude any method of communication and recognizes that there will be increasing use of modern communication techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communication between courts is required under Sections 14-13-204, 14-13-206, and 14-13-306 and strongly suggested in applying Section 14-13-207. Apart from those sections, there may be less need under this Act for courts to communicate concerning jurisdiction due to the prioritization of home state jurisdiction. Communication is authorized, however, whenever the court finds it would be helpful. The court may authorize the parties to participate in the communication. However, the Act does not mandate participation. Communication between courts is often difficult to schedule and participation by the parties may be impractical. Phone calls often have to be made after-hours or whenever the schedules of judges allow.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does require that a record be made of the conversation and that the parties have access to that record in order to be informed of the content of the conversation. The only exception to this requirement is when the communication involves relatively inconsequential matters such as scheduling, calendars, and court records. Included within this latter type of communication would be matters of cooperation between courts under Section 14-13-112. A record includes notes or transcripts of a court reporter who listened to a conference call between the courts, an electronic recording of a telephone call, a memorandum or an electronic record of the communication between the courts, or a memorandum or an electronic record made by a court after the communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second sentence of subsection (2) protects the parties against unauthorized ex parte communications. The parties' participation in the communication may amount to a hearing if there is an opportunity to present facts and jurisdictional arguments. However, absent such an opportunity, the participation of the parties should not to be considered a substitute for a hearing and the parties must be given an opportunity to fairly and fully present facts and arguments on the jurisdictional issue before a determination is made. This may be done through a hearing or, if appropriate, by affidavit or memorandum. The court is expected to set forth the basis for its jurisdictional decision, including any court-to-court communication which may have been a factor in the decision.

       This section is the heart of judicial cooperation provision of this Act. It provides mechanisms for courts to cooperate with each other in order to decide cases in an efficient manner without causing undue expense to the parties. Courts may request assistance from courts of other States and may assist courts of other States.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision on the assessment of costs for travel provided in the UCCJA § 19 has been changed. The UCCJA provided that the costs may be assessed against the parties or the State or county. Assessment of costs against a government entity in a case where the government is not involved is inappropriate and therefore that provision has been removed. In addition, if the State is involved as a party, assessment of costs and expenses against the State must be authorized by other law. It should be noted that the term "expenses" means out-of-pocket costs. Overhead costs should not be assessed as expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other substantive changes have been made. The term "social study" as used in the UCCJA was replaced with the modern term: "custody evaluation." The Act does not take a position on the admissibility of a custody evaluation that was conducted in another State. It merely authorizes a court to seek assistance of, or render assistance to, a court of another State.
      </p>

       This section provides mandatory jurisdictional rules for the original child custody proceeding. It generally continues the provisions of the UCCJA § 3. However, there have been a number of changes to the jurisdictional bases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        1. Home State Jurisdiction.
       </b>
       The jurisdiction of the home State has been prioritized over other jurisdictional bases. Section 3 of the UCCJA provided four independent and concurrent bases of jurisdiction. The PKPA provides that full faith and credit can only be given to an initial custody determination of a "significant connection" State when there is no home State. This Act prioritizes home state jurisdiction in the same manner as the PKPA thereby eliminating any potential conflict between the two acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The six-month extended home state provision of subsection (1)(a) has been modified slightly from the UCCJA. The UCCJA provided that home state jurisdiction continued for six months when the child had been removed by a person seeking the child's custody or for other reasons and a parent or a person acting as a parent continues to reside in the home State. Under this Act, it is no longer necessary to determine why the child has been removed. The only inquiry relates to the status of the person left behind. This change provides a slightly more refined home state standard than the UCCJA or the PKPA, which also requires a determination that the child has been removed "by a contestant or for other reasons." The scope of the PKPA's provision is theoretically narrower than this Act. However, the phrase "or for other reasons" covers most fact situations where the child is not in the home State and, therefore, the difference has no substantive effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       In another sense, the six-month extended home state jurisdiction provision is this Act is narrower than the comparable provision in the PKPA. The PKPA's definition of extended home State is more expansive because it applies whenever a "contestant" remains in the home State. That class of individuals has been eliminated in this Act. This Act retains the original UCCJA classification of "parent or person acting as parent" to define who must remain for a State to exercise the six-month extended home state jurisdiction. This eliminates the undesirable jurisdictional determinations which would occur as a result of differing state substantive laws on visitation involving grandparents and others. For example, if State A's law provided that grandparents could obtain visitation with a child after the death of one of the parents, then the grandparents, who would be considered "contestants" under the PKPA, could file a proceeding within six months after the remaining parent moved and have the case heard in State A. However, if State A did not provide that grandparents could seek visitation under such circumstances, the grandparents would not be considered "contestants" and State B where the child acquired a new home State would provide the only forum. This Act bases jurisdiction on the parent and child or person acting as a parent and child relationship without regard to grandparents or other potential seekers of custody or visitation. There is no conflict with the broader provision of the PKPA. The PKPA in § (c)(1) authorizes States to narrow the scope of their jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        2. Significant connection jurisdiction.
       </b>
       This jurisdictional basis has been amended in four particulars from the UCCJA. First, the "best interest" language of the UCCJA has been eliminated. This phrase tended to create confusion between the jurisdictional issue and the substantive custody determination. Since the language was not necessary for the jurisdictional issue, it has been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the UCCJA based jurisdiction on the presence of a significant connection between the child and the child's parents or the child and at least one contestant. This Act requires that the significant connections be between the child, the child's parents or the child and a person acting as a parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, a significant connection State may assume jurisdiction only when there is no home State or when the home State decides that the significant connection State would be a more appropriate forum under Section 14-13-207 or 14-13-208. Fourth, the determination of significant connections has been changed to eliminate the language of "present or future care." The jurisdictional determination should be made by determining whether there is sufficient evidence in the State for the court to make an informed custody determination. That evidence might relate to the past as well as to the "present or future."
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency jurisdiction has been moved to a separate section. This is to make it clear that the power to protect a child in crisis does not include the power to enter a permanent order for that child except as provided by that section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (1)(c) provides for jurisdiction when all States with jurisdiction under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) determine that this State is a more appropriate forum. The determination would have to be made by all States with jurisdiction under subsection (1)(a) and (b). Jurisdiction would not exist under this paragraph because the home State determined it is a more appropriate place to hear the case if there is another State that could exercise significant connection jurisdiction under subsection (1)(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (1)(d) retains the concept of jurisdiction by necessity as found in the UCCJA and in the PKPA. This default jurisdiction only occurs if no other State would have jurisdiction under subsections (1)(a) through (1)(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (2) and (3) clearly State the relationship between jurisdiction under this Act and other forms of jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction over, or the physical presence of, a parent or the child is neither necessary nor required under this Act. In other words neither minimum contacts nor service within the State is required for the court to have jurisdiction to make a custody determination. Further, the presence of minimum contacts or service within the State does not confer jurisdiction to make a custody determination. Subject to Section 14-13-204, satisfaction of the requirements of subsection (1) is mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements of this section, plus the notice and hearing provisions of the Act, are all that is necessary to satisfy due process. This Act, like the UCCJA and the PKPA is based on Justice Frankfurter's concurrence in
       <i>
        May v. Anderson
       </i>
       , 345 U.S. 528 (1953). As pointed out by Professor Bodenheimer, the reporter for the UCCJA, no "workable interstate custody law could be built around [Justice] Burton's plurality opinion ... ." Bridgette Bodenheimer, The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act: A Legislative Remedy for Children Caught in the Conflict of Laws, 22 Vand.L.Rev. 1207,1233 (1969). It should also be noted that since jurisdiction to make a child custody determination is subject matter jurisdiction, an agreement of the parties to confer jurisdiction on a court that would not otherwise have jurisdiction under this Act is ineffective.

       Temporary emergency jurisdiction did not provide court with jurisdiction to enter permanent order terminating parental rights without the court first obtaining home state jurisdiction pursuant to this section.
       
       The record does not disclose a basis on which the court could infer home state jurisdiction. Both "significant connection" and "more appropriate forum" jurisdiction requires the home state to affirmatively decline jurisdiction before another state can invoke it. Declining jurisdiction under the UCCJEA means more than just the absence of litigation in the home state. The home state must have an opportunity to weigh in and been made aware of a possible reason to do so. People in Interest of S.A.G.,

      </p>
      <p>
       The question of whether jurisdiction exists is distinct from the question of whether it should be exercised. Even if a determination that jurisdiction exists is made, the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, or it may stay the proceedings upon the condition that custody proceedings be initiated in another state.

        Instances giving rise to subject matter jurisdiction.

       The uniform act attempts to limit custody determination jurisdiction to only one state. Thus, this section confines subject matter jurisdiction to: (a) The home state of at least one parent, and of the child for the last six months; or (b) the state where there are other strong contacts with the child and his family and it is in the child's best interest; or (c) the state where the child is present if the child has been abandoned, or if there is an emergency case of child neglect; or (d) the state of the forum if it is in the child's best interest and no other state could or would assume jurisdiction.

        Intent to remain in the state is not grounds for exercise of initial child-custody jurisdiction.
       </b>
       Court erred in failing to conduct jurisdictional analysis required pursuant to the Uniform Child-custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) for initial child-custody jurisdiction. While court apparently concluded that this state was not the child's home state, the court did not determine whether another state was the child's home state. If no state qualifies as the child's home state, the court must look to the language of the statute to determine appropriate jurisdiction. Except in the event of an emergency, the UCCJEA delineates the exclusive jurisdictional bases for making a child-custody determination by a court of this state. Madrone v.

       A modification of visitation rights is a "custody determination" under § 14-13-103(2), and so, pursuant to this section, where a child and his parents have been living in this state for over a year, a trial court of this state has the jurisdiction to modify a foreign child visitation order.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This is a new section addressing continuing jurisdiction. Continuing jurisdiction was not specifically addressed in the UCCJA. Its absence caused considerable confusion, particularly because the PKPA, § 1738(d), requires other States to give Full Faith and Credit to custody determinations made by the original decree State pursuant to the decree State's continuing jurisdiction so long as that State has jurisdiction under its own law and remains the residence of the child or any contestant.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides the rules of continuing jurisdiction and borrows from UIFSA as well as recent UCCJA case law. The continuing jurisdiction of the original decree State is exclusive. It continues until one of two events occurs:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. If a parent or a person acting as a parent remains in the original decree State, continuing jurisdiction is lost when neither the child, the child and a parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent continue to have a significant connection with the original decree State and there is no longer substantial evidence concerning the child's care, protection, training and personal relations in that State. In other words, even if the child has acquired a new home State, the original decree State retains exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, so long as the general requisites of the "substantial connection" jurisdiction provisions of Section 14-13-201 are met. If the relationship between the child and the person remaining in the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction becomes so attenuated that the court could no longer find significant connections and substantial evidence, jurisdiction would no longer exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of the phrase "a court of this State" under subsection (1)(a) makes it clear that the original decree State is the sole determinant of whether jurisdiction continues. A party seeking to modify a custody determination must obtain an order from the original decree State stating that it no longer has jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Continuing jurisdiction is lost when the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent no longer reside in the original decree State. The exact language of subparagraph (1)(b) was the subject of considerable debate. Ultimately the Conference settled on the phrase that "a court of this State or a court of another State determines that the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this State" to determine when the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction of a State ended. The phrase is meant to be identical in meaning to the language of the PKPA which provides that full faith and credit is to be given to custody determinations made by a State in the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction when that "State remains the residence of ... ." The phrase is also the equivalent of the language "continues to reside" which occurs in UIFSA § 205(a)(1) to determine the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction of the State that made a support order. The phrase "remains the residence of" in the PKPA has been the subject of conflicting case law. It is the intention of this Act that paragraph (1)(b) of this section means that the named persons no longer continue to actually live within the State. Thus, unless a modification proceeding has been commenced, when the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents physically leave the State to live elsewhere, the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction ceases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase "do not presently reside" is not used in the sense of a technical domicile. The fact that the original determination State still considers one parent a domiciliary does not prevent it from losing exclusive, continuing jurisdiction after the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have moved from the State.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have all left the State which made the custody determination prior to the commencement of the modification proceeding, considerations of waste of resources dictate that a court in State B, as well as a court in State A, can decide that State A has lost exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continuing jurisdiction provisions of this section are narrower than the comparable provisions of the PKPA. That statute authorizes continuing jurisdiction so long as any "contestant" remains in the original decree State and that State continues to have jurisdiction under its own law. This Act eliminates the contestant classification. The Conference decided that a remaining grandparent or other third party who claims a right to visitation, should not suffice to confer exclusive, continuing jurisdiction on the State that made the original custody determination after the departure of the child, the parents and any person acting as a parent. The significant connection to the original decree State must relate to the child, the child and a parent, or the child and a person acting as a parent. This revision does not present a conflict with the PKPA. The PKPA's reference in § 1738(d) to § 1738 (c)(1) recognizes that States may narrow the class of cases that would be subject to exclusive, continuing jurisdiction. However, during the transition from the UCCJA to this Act, some States may continue to base continuing jurisdiction on the continued presence of a contestant, such as a grandparent. The PKPA will require that such decisions be enforced. The problem will disappear as States adopt this Act to replace the UCCJA.
      </p>

       Jurisdiction attaches at the commencement of a proceeding. If State A had jurisdiction under this section at the time a modification proceeding was commenced there, it would not be lost by all parties moving out of the State prior to the conclusion of proceeding. State B would not have jurisdiction to hear a modification unless State A decided that State B was more appropriate under Section 14-13-207.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exclusive, continuing jurisdiction is not reestablished if, after the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents leave the State, the non-custodial parent returns. As subsection (2) provides, once a State has lost exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, it can modify its own determination only if it has jurisdiction under the standards of Section 14-13-201. If another State acquires exclusive continuing jurisdiction under this section, then its orders cannot be modified even if this State has once again become the home State of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       In accordance with the majority of UCCJA case law, the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction may relinquish jurisdiction when it determines that another State would be a more convenient forum under the principles of Section 14-13-207.

      <p>
       This section complements Section 14-13-202 and is addressed to the court that is confronted with a proceeding to modify a custody determination of another State. It prohibits a court from modifying a custody determination made consistently with this Act by a court in another State unless a court of that State determines that it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 14-13-202 or that this State would be a more convenient forum under Section 14-13-207. The modification State is not authorized to determine that the original decree State has lost its jurisdiction. The only exception is when the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other State. In other words, a court of the modification State can determine that all parties have moved away from the original State. The court of the modification State must have jurisdiction under the standards of Section 14-13-201.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section are an elaboration of what was formerly Section 3(a)(3) of the UCCJA. It remains, as Professor Bodenheimer's comments to that section noted, "an extraordinary jurisdiction reserved for extraordinary circumstances."
      </p>
      <p>
       This section codifies and clarifies several aspects of what has become common practice in emergency jurisdiction cases under the UCCJA and PKPA. First, a court may take jurisdiction to protect the child even though it can claim neither home State nor significant connection jurisdiction. Second, the duties of States to recognize, enforce and not modify a custody determination of another State do not take precedence over the need to enter a temporary emergency order to protect the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, a custody determination made under the emergency jurisdiction provisions of this section is a temporary order. The purpose of the order is to protect the child until the State that has jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203 enters an order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under certain circumstances, however, subsection (2) provides that an emergency custody determination may become a final custody determination. If there is no existing custody determination, and no custody proceeding is filed in a State with jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203, an emergency custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination, if it so provides, when the State that issues the order becomes the home State of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) is concerned with the temporary nature of the order when there exists a prior custody order that is entitled to be enforced under this Act or when a subsequent custody proceeding is filed in a State with jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203. Subsection (3) allows the temporary order to remain in effect only so long as is necessary for the person who obtained the determination under this section to present a case and obtain an order from the State with jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203. That time period must be specified in the order. If there is an existing order by a State with jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203, that order need not be reconfirmed. The temporary emergency determination would lapse by its own terms at the end of the specified period or when an order is obtained from the court with jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-202 to 14-13-203. The court with appropriate jurisdiction also may decide, under the provisions of 207, that the court that entered the emergency order is in a better position to address the safety of the person who obtained the emergency order, or the child, and decline jurisdiction under Section 14-13-207.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any hearing in the State with jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203 on the temporary emergency determination is subject to the provisions of Sections 14-13-111 and 14-13-112. These sections facilitate the presentation of testimony and evidence taken out of State. If there is a concern that the person obtaining the temporary emergency determination under this section would be in danger upon returning to the State with jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203, these provisions should be used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (4) requires communication between the court of the State that is exercising jurisdiction under this section and the court of another State that is exercising jurisdiction under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203. The pleading rules of Section 14-13-209 apply fully to determinations made under this section. Therefore, a person seeking a temporary emergency custody determination is required to inform the court pursuant to Section 14-13-209 (4) of any proceeding concerning the child that has been commenced elsewhere. The person commencing the custody proceeding under Sections 14-13-201 to 14-13-203 is required under Section 14-13-209 (1) to inform the court about the temporary emergency proceeding. These pleading requirements are to be strictly followed so that the courts are able to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child, and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.

       <b>
        Relationship to the PKPA.
       </b>
       The definition of emergency has been modified to harmonize it with the PKPA. The PKPA's definition of emergency jurisdiction does not use the term "neglect." It defines an emergency as "mistreatment or abuse." Therefore "neglect" has been eliminated as a basis for the assumption of temporary emergency jurisdiction. Neglect is so elastic a concept that it could justify taking emergency jurisdiction in a wide variety of cases. Under the PKPA, if a State exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction based on a finding that the child was neglected without a finding of mistreatment or abuse, the order would not be entitled to federal enforcement in other States.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Relationship to Protective Order Proceedings.
       </b>
       The UCCJA and the PKPA were enacted long before the advent of state procedures on the use of protective orders to alleviate problems of domestic violence. Issues of custody and visitation often arise within the context of protective order proceedings since the protective order is often invoked to keep one parent away from the other parent and the children when there is a threat of violence. This Act recognizes that a protective order proceeding will often be the procedural vehicle for invoking jurisdiction by authorizing a court to assume temporary emergency jurisdiction when the child's parent or sibling has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for a protective order that contains a custody determination to be enforceable in another State it must comply with the provisions of this Act and the PKPA. Although the Violence Against Women's Act (VAWA), 18 U.S.C. § 2265, does provide an independent basis for the granting of full faith and credit to protective orders, it expressly excludes "custody" orders from the definition of "protective order," 22 U.S.C. § 2266.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many States authorize the issuance of protective orders in an emergency without notice and hearing. This Act does not address the propriety of that procedure. It is left to local law to determine the circumstances under which such an order could be issued, and the type of notice that is required, in a case without an interstate element. However, an order issued after the assumption of temporary emergency jurisdiction is entitled to interstate enforcement and nonmodification under this Act and the PKPA only if there has been notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard as set out in Section 14-13-205. Although VAWA does require that full faith and credit be accorded to ex parte protective orders if notice will be given and there will be a reasonable opportunity to be heard, it does not include a "custody" order within the definition of "protective order."
      </p>
      <p>
       VAWA does play an important role in determining whether an emergency exists. That Act requires a court to give full faith and credit to a protective order issued in another State if the order is made in accordance with the VAWA. This would include those findings of fact contained in the order. When a court is deciding whether an emergency exists under this section, it may not relitigate the existence of those factual findings.

      <p>
       This section generally continues the notice provisions of the UCCJA. However, it does not attempt to dictate who is entitled to notice. Local rules vary with regard to persons entitled to seek custody of a child. Therefore, this section simply indicates that persons entitled to seek custody should receive notice but leaves the rest of the determination to local law. Parents whose parental rights have not been previously terminated and persons having physical custody of the child are specifically mentioned as persons who must be given notice. The PKPA, § 1738A(e), requires that they be given notice in order for the custody determination to be entitled to full faith and credit under that Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       State laws also vary with regard to whether a court has the power to issue an enforceable temporary custody order without notice and hearing in a case without any interstate element. Such temporary orders may be enforceable, as against due process objections, for a short period of time if issued as a protective order or a temporary restraining order to protect a child from harm. Whether such orders are enforceable locally is beyond the scope of this Act. Subsection (2) clearly provides that the validity of such orders and the enforceability of such orders is governed by the law which authorizes them and not by this Act. An order is entitled to interstate enforcement and nonmodification under this Act only if there has been notice and an opportunity to be heard. The PKPA, § 1738A(e), also requires that a custody determination is entitled to full faith and credit only if there has been notice and an opportunity to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules requiring joinder of people with an interest in the custody of and visitation with a child also vary widely throughout the country. The UCCJA has a separate section on joinder of parties which has been eliminated. The issue of who is entitled to intervene and who must be joined in a custody proceeding is to be determined by local state law.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sentence of the UCCJA § 4 which indicated that persons outside the State were to be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in accordance with the provision of that Act has been eliminated as redundant.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section represents the remnants of the simultaneous proceedings provision of the UCCJA § 6. The problem of simultaneous proceedings is no longer a significant issue. Most of the problems have been resolved by the prioritization of home state jurisdiction under Section 14-13-201; the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction provisions of Section 14-13-202; and the prohibitions on modification of Section 14-13-203. If there is a home State, there can be no exercise of significant connection jurisdiction in an initial child custody determination and, therefore, no simultaneous proceedings. If there is a State of exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, there cannot be another State with concurrent jurisdiction and, therefore, no simultaneous proceedings. Of course, the home State, as well as the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, could defer to another State under Section 14-13-207. However, that decision is left entirely to the home State or the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this Act, the simultaneous proceedings problem will arise only when there is no home State, no State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction and more than one significant connection State. For those cases, this section retains the "first in time" rule of the UCCJA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) retains the UCCJA's policy favoring judicial communication. Communication between courts is required when it is determined that a proceeding has been commenced in another State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) concerns the problem of simultaneous proceedings in the State with modification jurisdiction and enforcement proceedings under part 3. This section authorizes the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction to stay the modification proceeding pending the outcome of the enforcement proceeding, to enjoin the parties from continuing with the enforcement proceeding, or to continue the modification proceeding under such conditions as it determines are appropriate. The court may wish to communicate with the enforcement court. However, communication is not mandatory. Although the enforcement State is required by the PKPA to enforce according to its terms a custody determination made consistently with the PKPA, that duty is subject to the decree being modified by a State with the power to do so under the PKPA. An order to enjoin the parties from enforcing the decree is the equivalent of a temporary modification by a State with the authority to do so. The concomitant provision addressed to the enforcement court is Section 14-13-306 of this Act. That section requires the enforcement court to communicate with the modification court in order to determine what action the modification court wishes the enforcement court to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "pending" that was utilized in the UCCJA section on simultaneous proceeding has been replaced. It has caused considerable confusion in the case law. It has been replaced with the term "commencement of the proceeding" as more accurately reflecting the policy behind this section. The latter term is defined in Section 14-13-102 (5).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section retains the focus of Section 7 of the UCCJA. It authorizes courts to decide that another State is in a better position to make the custody determination, taking into consideration the relative circumstances of the parties. If so, the court may defer to the other State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list of factors that the court may consider has been updated from the UCCJA. The list is not meant to be exclusive. Several provisions require comment. Subparagraph (2)(a) is concerned specifically with domestic violence and other matters affecting the health and safety of the parties. For this purpose, the court should determine whether the parties are located in different States because one party is a victim of domestic violence or child abuse. If domestic violence or child abuse has occurred, this factor authorizes the court to consider which State can best protect the victim from further violence or abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In applying subparagraph (2)(c), courts should realize that distance concerns can be alleviated by applying the communication and cooperation provisions of Sections 14-13-111 and 14-13-112.
      </p>
      <p>
       In applying subsection (2)(g) on expeditious resolution of the controversy, the court could consider the different procedural and evidentiary laws of the two States, as well as the flexibility of the court dockets. It also should consider the ability of a court to arrive at a solution to all the legal issues surrounding the family. If one State has jurisdiction to decide both the custody and support issues, it would be desirable to determine that State to be the most convenient forum. The same is true when children of the same family live in different States. It would be inappropriate to require parents to have custody proceedings in several States when one State could resolve the custody of all the children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before determining whether to decline or retain jurisdiction, the court of this State may communicate, in accordance with Section 14-13-110, with a court of another State and exchange information pertinent to the assumption of jurisdiction by either court.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two departures from Section 7 of the UCCJA. First, the court may not simply dismiss the action. To do so would leave the case in limbo. Rather the court shall stay the case and direct the parties to file in the State that has been found to be the more convenient forum. The court is also authorized to impose any other conditions it considers appropriate. This might include the issuance of temporary custody orders during the time necessary to commence a proceeding in the designated State, dismissing the case if the custody proceeding is not commenced in the other State or resuming jurisdiction if a court of the other State refuses to take the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, UCCJA, § 7(g) which allowed the court to assess fees and costs if it was a clearly inappropriate court, has been eliminated. If a court has jurisdiction under this Act, it could not be a clearly inappropriate court.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The "Clean Hands" section of the UCCJA has been truncated in this Act. Since there is no longer a multiplicity of jurisdictions which could take cognizance of a child-custody proceeding, there is less of a concern that one parent will take the child to another jurisdiction in an attempt to find a more favorable forum. Most of the jurisdictional problems generated by abducting parents should be solved by the prioritization of home State in Section 14-13-201; the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction provisions of Section 14-13-202; and the ban on modification in Section 14-13-203. For example, if a parent takes the child from the home State and seeks an original custody determination elsewhere, the stay-at-home parent has six months to file a custody petition under the extended home state jurisdictional provision of Section 14-13-201, which will ensure that the case is retained in the home State. If a petitioner for a modification determination takes the child from the State that issued the original custody determination, another State cannot assume jurisdiction as long at the first State exercises exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, there are still a number of cases where parents, or their surrogates, act in a reprehensible manner, such as removing, secreting, retaining, or restraining the child. This section ensures that abducting parents will not receive an advantage for their unjustifiable conduct. If the conduct that creates the jurisdiction is unjustified, courts must decline to exercise jurisdiction that is inappropriately invoked by one of the parties. For example, if one parent abducts the child pre-decree and establishes a new home State, that jurisdiction will decline to hear the case. There are exceptions. If the other party has acquiesced in the court's jurisdiction, the court may hear the case. Such acquiescence may occur by filing a pleading submitting to the jurisdiction, or by not filing in the court that would otherwise have jurisdiction under this Act. Similarly, if the court that would have jurisdiction finds that the court of this State is a more appropriate forum, the court may hear the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to those situations where jurisdiction exists because of the unjustified conduct of the person seeking to invoke it. If, for example, a parent in the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 14-13-202 has either restrained the child from visiting with the other parent, or has retained the child after visitation, and seeks to modify the decree, this section in inapplicable. The conduct of restraining or retaining the child did not create jurisdiction. Jurisdiction existed under this Act without regard to the parent's conduct. Whether a court should decline to hear the parent's request to modify is a matter of local law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The focus in this section is on the unjustified conduct of the person who invokes the jurisdiction of the court. A technical illegality or wrong is insufficient to trigger the applicability of this section. This is particularly important in cases involving domestic violence and child abuse. Domestic violence victims should not be charged with unjustifiable conduct for conduct that occurred in the process of fleeing domestic violence, even if their conduct is technically illegal. Thus, if a parent flees with a child to escape domestic violence and in the process violates a joint custody decree, the case should not be automatically dismissed under this section. An inquiry must be made into whether the flight was justified under the circumstances of the case. However, an abusive parent who seizes the child and flees to another State to establish jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct and the new State must decline to exercise jurisdiction under this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) authorizes the court to fashion an appropriate remedy for the safety of the child and to prevent a repetition of the unjustified conduct. Thus, it would be appropriate for the court to notify the other parent and to provide for foster care for the child until the child is returned to the other parent. The court could also stay the proceeding and require that a custody proceeding be instituted in another State that would have jurisdiction under this Act. It should be noted that the court is not making a forum non conveniens analysis in this section. If the conduct is unjustifiable, it must decline jurisdiction. It may, however, retain jurisdiction until a custody proceeding is commenced in the appropriate tribunal if such retention is necessary to prevent a repetition of the wrongful conduct or to ensure the safety of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney's fee standard for this section is patterned after the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11607(b)(3). The assessed costs and fees are to be paid to the respondent who established that jurisdiction was based on unjustifiable conduct.

      <p>
       The pleading requirements from Section 9 of the UCCJA are generally carried over into this Act. However, the information is made subject to local law on the protection of names and other identifying information in certain cases. A number of States have enacted laws relating to the protection of victims in domestic violence and child abuse cases which provide for the confidentiality of victims names, addresses, and other information. These procedures must be followed if the child-custody proceeding of the State requires their applicability. See, e.g., California Family Law Code § 3409(a). If a State does not have local law that provides for protecting names and addresses, then subsection (5) or a similar provision should be adopted. Subsection (5) is based on the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judge's, Model Code on Domestic and Family Violence § 304(c). There are other models to choose from, in particular UIFSA § 312.
      </p>
      <p>
       In subsection (1)(b), the term "proceedings" should be read broadly to include more than custody proceedings. Thus, if one parent was being criminally prosecuted for child abuse or custodial interference, those proceedings should be disclosed. If the child is subject to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, facts relating to compliance with the Compact should be disclosed in the pleading or affidavit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1)(b) has been added. It authorizes the court to stay the proceeding until the information required in subsection (1)(a) has been disclosed, although failure to provide the information does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear the case. This follows the majority of jurisdictions which held that failure to comply with the pleading requirements of the UCCJA did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to make a custody determination.

      <p>
       No major changes have been made to this section which was Section 11 of the UCCJA. Language was added to subsection (1) to authorize the court to require a non-party who has physical custody of the child to produce the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) authorizes the court to enter orders providing for the safety of the child and the person ordered to appear with the child. If safety is a major concern, the court, as an alternative to ordering a party to appear with the child, could order and arrange for the party's testimony to be taken in another State under Section 14-13-111. This alternative might be important when there are safety concerns regarding requiring victims of domestic violence or child abuse to travel to the jurisdiction where the abuser resides.

      <p>
       This section is based on Section 13 of the UCCJA which contained the basic duty to enforce. The language of the original section has been retained and the duty to enforce is generally the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enforcement of custody determinations of issuing States is also required by federal law in the PKPA, 28 U.S.C. § 1738A(a). The changes made in Part 2 of this Act now make a State's duty to enforce and not modify a child custody determination of another State consistent with the enforcement and nonmodification provisions of the PKPA. Therefore custody determinations made by a State pursuant to the UCCJA that would be enforceable under the PKPA will generally be enforced under this Act. However, if a State custody determination made pursuant to the UCCJA would not be enforceable under the PKPA, it will also not be enforceable under this Act. Thus a custody determination made by a "significant connection" jurisdiction when there is a home State is not enforceable under the PKPA regardless of whether a proceeding was ever commenced in the home State. Even though such a determination would be enforceable under the UCCJA with its four concurrent bases of jurisdiction, it would not be enforceable under this Act. This carries out the policy of the PKPA of strongly discouraging a State from exercising its concurrent "significant connection" jurisdiction under the UCCJA when another State could exercise "home state" jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section also incorporates the concept of Section 15 of the UCCJA to the effect that a custody determination of another State will be enforced in the same manner as a custody determination made by a court of this State. Whatever remedies are available to enforce a local determination can be utilized to enforce a custody determination of another State. However, it remains a custody determination of the State that issued it. A child-custody determination of another State is not subject to modification unless the State would have jurisdiction to modify the determination under Part 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remedies provided by this part for the enforcement of a custody determination will normally be used. This part does not detract from other remedies available under other local law. There is often a need for a number of remedies to ensure that a child-custody determination is obeyed. If other remedies would easily facilitate enforcement, they are still available. The petitioner, for example, can still cite the respondent for contempt of court or file a tort claim for intentional interference with custodial relations if those remedies are available under local law.

       Colorado not required to give full faith and credit to another state's custody order if order was not entered in compliance with the PKPA.
       
       Under the PKPA, a state's custody determination is in conformance with the PKPA if the court of the state has jurisdiction under its own law and the exercise of jurisdiction meets one of the conditions set forth in the PKPA. Because Nebraska, like Colorado, has adopted the UCCJEA, and the UCCJEA is substantively identical to the PKPA, the provisions of Nebraska's state law conform to the PKPA. Therefore, because Nebraska lacked jurisdiction to enter the custody order under its own law, it lacked jurisdiction to enter the order under the PKPA and Colorado is not required to recognize and enforce the order pursuant to the PKPA. In re L.S., 257 P.3d 201 (

       Where New York family court referee determined that it lacked exclusive, continuing jurisdiction to modify New York custody order and declined jurisdiction, a New York Supreme Court (trial court) lacked jurisdiction to enter order in a subsequent motion to modify custody. New York has adopted the UCCJEA and, therefore, the jurisdictional provisions of New York law are substantially identical to the PKPA. Consequently, because the second New York court did not have jurisdiction over the matter under New York law, the PKPA does not require that Colorado accord full faith and credit to the second court's custody modification order and the Colorado court erred in enforcing the New York order modifying custody.

       Court may grant other than temporary relief where out-of-state application impractical.
       
       Generally, judicial relief should not extend beyond the issuance of temporary protective orders pending the application to the court of the rendering state for appropriate modification of the custody decree. Only when there are compelling reasons, articulated in the record, that render such out-of-state application impractical, should a Colorado court grant anything but temporary relief under its parens patriae jurisdiction.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section authorizes a court to issue a temporary order if it is necessary to enforce visitation rights without violating the rules on nonmodification contained in Section 14-13-303. Therefore, if there is a visitation schedule provided in the custody determination that was made in accordance with Part 2, a court can issue an order under this section implementing the schedule. An implementing order may include make-up or substitute visitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A court may also issue a temporary order providing for visitation if visitation was authorized in the custody determination, but no specific schedule was included in the custody determination. Such an order could include a substitution of a specific visitation schedule for "reasonable and seasonable."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a court may not, under subsection (1)(b) provide for a permanent change in visitation. Therefore, requests for a permanent change in the visitation schedule must be addressed to the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 14-13-202 or modification jurisdiction under Section 14-13-203. As under Section 14-13-204, subsection (2) of this section requires that the temporary visitation order stay in effect only long enough to allow the person who obtained the order to obtain a permanent modification in the State with appropriate jurisdiction under Part 2.

       This remainder of this part provides enforcement mechanisms for interstate child custody determinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes a simple registration procedure that can be used to predetermine the enforceability of a custody determination. It parallels the process in UIFSA for the registration of child support orders. It should be as much of an aid to pro se litigants as the registration procedure of UIFSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       A custody determination can be registered without any accompanying request for enforcement. This may be of significant assistance in international cases. For example, the custodial parent under a foreign custody order can receive an advance determination of whether that order would be recognized and enforced before sending the child to the United States for visitation. Article 26 of the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition and Cooperation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, 35 I.L.M. 1391 (1996), requires those States which accede to the Convention to provide such a procedure.

      <p>
       The pleading rules of Section 14-13-308, require the parties to disclose any pending proceedings. Normally, an enforcement proceeding will take precedence over a modification action since the PKPA requires enforcement of child custody determinations made in accordance with its terms. However, the enforcement court must communicate with the modification court in order to avoid duplicative litigation. The courts might decide that the court with jurisdiction under Part 2 shall continue with the modification action and stay the enforcement proceeding. Or they might decide that the enforcement proceeding shall go forward. The ultimate decision rests with the court having exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 14-13-202, or if there is no State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, then the decision rests with the State that would have jurisdiction to modify under Section 14-13-203. Therefore, if that court determines that the enforcement proceeding should be stayed or dismissed, the enforcement court should stay or dismiss the proceeding. If the enforcement court does not do so, the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 14-13-202, or with modification jurisdiction under Section 14-13-203, could enjoin the parties from continuing with the enforcement proceeding.

      <p>
       This section provides the normal remedy that will be used in interstate cases: the production of the child in a summary, remedial process based on habeas corpus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition is intended to provide the court with as much information as possible. Attaching certified copies of all orders sought to be enforced allows the court to have the necessary information. Most of the information relates to the permissible scope of the court's inquiry. The petitioner has the responsibility to inform the court of all proceedings that would affect the current enforcement action. Specific mention is made of certain proceedings to ensure that they are disclosed. A "procedure relating to domestic violence" includes not only protective order proceedings but also criminal prosecutions for child abuse or domestic violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The order requires the respondent to appear at a hearing on the next judicial day. The term "next judicial day" in this section means the next day when a judge is at the courthouse. At the hearing, the court will order the child to be delivered to the petitioner unless the respondent is prepared to assert that the issuing State lacked jurisdiction, that notice was not given in accordance with Section 14-13-108, or that the order sought to be enforced has been vacated, modified, or stayed by a court with jurisdiction to do so under Part 2. The court is also to order payment of the fees and expenses set out in Section 14-13-312. The court may set another hearing to determine whether additional relief available under this state's law should be granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the order has been registered and confirmed in accordance with Section 14-13-304, the only defense to enforcement is that the order has been vacated, stayed or modified since the registration proceeding by a court with jurisdiction to do so under Part 2.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The scope of inquiry for the enforcing court is quite limited. Federal law requires the court to enforce the custody determination if the issuing state's decree was rendered in compliance with the PKPA. 28 U.S.C. § 1738A(a). This Act requires enforcement of custody determinations that are made in conformity with Part 2's jurisdictional rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       The certified copy, or a copy of the certified copy, of the custody determination entitling the petitioner to the child is prima facie evidence of the issuing court's jurisdiction to enter the order. If the order is one that is entitled to be enforced under Part 2 and if it has been violated, the burden shifts to the respondent to show that the custody determination is not entitled to enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a defense to enforcement that another jurisdiction has issued a custody determination that is required to be enforced under Part 2. An example is when one court has based its original custody determination on the UCCJA § 3(a)(2) (significant connections) and another jurisdiction has rendered an original custody determination based on the UCCJA § 3(a)(1) (home State). When this occurs, Part 2 of this Act, as well as the PKPA, mandate that the home state determination be enforced in all other States, including the State that rendered the significant connections determination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of notice in accordance with Section 14-13-108 by a person entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard at the original custody determination is a defense to enforcement of the custody determination. The scope of the defense under this Act is the same as the defense would be under the law of the State that issued the notice. Thus, if the defense of lack of notice would not be available under local law if the respondent purposely hid from the petitioner, took deliberate steps to avoid service of process or elected not to participate in the initial proceedings, the defense would also not be available under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no other defenses to an enforcement action. If the child would be endangered by the enforcement of a custody or visitation order, there may be a basis for the assumption of emergency jurisdiction under Section 14-13-204 of this Act. Upon the finding of an emergency, the court issues a temporary order and directs the parties to proceed either in the court that is exercising continuing jurisdiction over the custody proceeding under Section 14-13-202, or the court that would have jurisdiction to modify the custody determination under Section 14-13-203.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court shall determine at the hearing whether fees should be awarded under Section 14-13-312. If so, it should order them paid. The court may determine if additional relief is appropriate, including requesting law enforcement officers to assist the petitioner in the enforcement of the order. The court may set a hearing to determine whether further relief should be granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remainder of this section is derived from UIFSA § 316 with regard to the privilege of self-incrimination, spousal privileges, and immunities. It is included to keep parallel the procedures for child support and child custody proceedings to the extent possible.

      <p>
       The section provides a remedy for emergency situations where there is a reason to believe that the child will suffer imminent, serious physical harm or be removed from the jurisdiction once the respondent learns that the petitioner has filed an enforcement proceeding. If the court finds such harm exists, it should temporarily waive the notice requirements and issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child. Immediately after the warrant is executed, the respondent is to receive notice of the proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "harm" cannot be totally defined and, as in the issuance of temporary retraining orders, the appropriate issuance of a warrant is left to the circumstances of the case. Those circumstances include cases where the respondent is the subject of a criminal proceeding as well as situations where the respondent is secreting the child in violation of a court order, abusing the child, a flight risk and other circumstances that the court concludes make the issuance of notice a danger to the child. The court must hear the testimony of the petitioner or another witness prior to issuing the warrant. The testimony may be heard in person, via telephone, or by any other means acceptable under local law. The court must State the reasons for the issuance of the warrant. The warrant can be enforced by law enforcement officers wherever the child is found in the State. The warrant may authorize entry upon private property to pick up the child if no less intrusive means are possible. In extraordinary cases, the warrant may authorize law enforcement to make a forcible entry at any hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The warrant must provide for the placement of the child pending the determination of the enforcement proceeding. Since the issuance of the warrant would not occur absent a risk of serious harm to the child, placement cannot be with the respondent. Normally, the child would be placed with the petitioner. However, if placement with the petitioner is not indicated, the court can order any other appropriate placement authorized under the laws of the court's State. Placement with the petitioner may not be indicated if there is a likelihood that the petitioner also will flee the jurisdiction. Placement with the petitioner may not be practical if the petitioner is proceeding through an attorney and is not present before the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes the court to utilize whatever means are available under local law to ensure the appearance of the petitioner and child at the enforcement hearing. Such means might include cash bonds, a surrender of a passport, or whatever the court determines is necessary.

       This section is derived from the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11607(b)(3). Normally the court will award fees and costs against the non-prevailing party. Included as expenses are the amount of investigation fees incurred by private persons or by public officials as well as the cost of child placement during the proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The non-prevailing party has the burden of showing that such an award would be clearly inappropriate. Fees and costs may be inappropriate if their payment would cause the parent and child to seek public assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section implements the policies of Section 8(c) of Pub.L. 96-611 (part of the PKPA) which provides that:
      </p>
      <p>
       In furtherance of the purposes of section 1738A of title 28, United States Code [this section], as added by subsection (1) of this section, State courts are encouraged to --
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) award to the person entitled to custody or visitation pursuant to a custody determination which is consistent with the provisions of such section 1738A [this section], necessary travel expenses, attorneys' fees, costs of private investigations, witness fees or expenses, and other expenses incurred in connection with such custody determination ... .
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "prevailing party" is not given a special definition for this Act. Each State will apply its own standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) was added to ensure that this section would not apply to the State unless otherwise authorized. The language is taken from UIFSA § 313 (court may assess costs against obligee or support enforcement agency only if allowed by local law).

       The order may be appealed as an expedited civil matter. An enforcement order should not be stayed by the court. Provisions for a stay would defeat the purpose of having a quick enforcement procedure. If there is a risk of serious mistreatment or abuse to the child, a petition to assume emergency jurisdiction must be filed under Section 14-13-204. This section leaves intact the possibility of obtaining an extraordinary remedy such as mandamus or prohibition from an appellate court to stay the court's enforcement action. In many States, it is not possible to limit the constitutional authority of appellate courts to issue a stay. However, unless the information before the appellate panel indicates that emergency jurisdiction would be assumed under Section 14-13-204, there is no reason to stay the enforcement of the order pending appeal.

      PREFATORY NOTE
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Child abduction is a serious problem both in scope and effect. A study commissioned by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention estimated that 262,100 children were abducted in 1999; 203,900 (78 per cent) of them were abducted by a parent or family member; approximately 1000 of the abductions were international.
    </p>

     See David Finkelhor, Heather Hammer &amp; Andrea J. Sedlak, National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children, Children Abducted by Family Members: National Estimate and Characteristics (Oct. 2002).
    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose of the Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act is to deter both predecree and postdecree domestic and international child abductions by parents, persons acting on behalf of a parent or others. Family abductions may be preventable through the identification of risk factors and the imposition of appropriate preventive measures.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act is premised on the general principle that preventing an abduction is in a child's best interests. Abducted children may suffer long- lasting harm. Federal law recognizes that parental abduction is harmful to children.

     (characterizing child abduction as abuse).
    </p>
    <p>
     Child abductions can occur before or after entry of a child-custody determination. This Act allows the court to impose abduction prevention measures at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many abductions occur before a court has had the opportunity to enter a child-custody determination. Children at the center of custody disputes are at the highest risk for potential abductions.
    </p>
    <p>
     ³America's Hidden Crime: When the Kidnapper is Kin 10- 11 (Polly Klaas Foundation 2004). See also Janet R. Johnston et al., Early Identification of Risk Factors for Parental Abduction (OJJDP March 2001)(indicating that men are more likely to abduct before an order is entered while women are more likely to abduct after a child custody determination).
    </p>
    <p>
     Jurisdictional laws help deter abductions by specifying the proper state to handle custody litigation. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup49 Unif. L. Ann. Part I 115 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     sets out four concurrent bases for jurisdiction. Congress passed the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 to deter abductions, discourage interstate conflicts, and promote cooperation between states about custody matters by resolving jurisdictional conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup5Pub. L. No. 96-611, note 7 to 28 U.S.C. § 1738A.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act prioritizes the state in which the child has lived for six months preceding the filing of the petition (the home state) as the place for custody litigation
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup628 U.S.C. Section 1738A(c).
    </p>
    <p>
     and prohibits a second state from assuming jurisdiction if there is an action pending in the state that has proper jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup728 U.S.C.A. Section 1738A(g).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act,
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup89 Unif. L. Ann. Part I 657 (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     now in 45 jurisdictions, also prioritizes home state jurisdiction notwithstanding the child's absence. Jurisdictional laws do not provide prevention measures for abduction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Post-decree abductions often occur because the existing child-custody determinations lack sufficient protective provisions to prevent an abduction. An award of joint physical custody without a designation of specific times; a vague order granting "reasonable visitation"; or the lack any restrictions on custody and visitation make orders hard to enforce. The awareness of abduction risk factors and preventive measures available can reduce the threat of abduction by giving the court the tools to make the initial child-custody determination clearer, more specific, and more easily enforceable.
    </p>
    <p>
     If an abduction occurs after a child-custody determination, all states have enforcement remedies. Forty-six jurisdictions use the procedures in Article 3 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. In addition, courts can punish abductors for contempt and allow tort actions for custodial interference. Several federal laws help locate missing children

    </p>
    <p>
     While there is no federal law criminalizing interstate parental kidnapping, there is a mechanism for apprehending persons who violate state parental kidnapping laws and travel across state lines.

When enacting the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, Congress declared that the Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution provision applies to cases involving parental kidnapping and interstate or international flight to avoid prosecution. Pub. L. No. 96-611, 10(a).
    </p>
    <p>
     While every state criminally forbids custodial interference by parents or relatives of the child, the laws differ as to the elements of the offenses, the punishments given, and whether a child-custody determination must exist for a violation to occur.

     If the abduction is international, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, currently in effect between the United States and fifty-five countries, facilitates the return of an abducted child to the child's habitual residence.
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup13See The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 51 Fed. Reg. § 10494 et seq.

For a current list of United States treaty partners, visit www.travel.state.gov/family/abduction/hague_issues/hague_issues_1487.html. Many countries, however, have not ratified the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, the United States has not accepted all nations' accessions, and some countries that have ratified do not comply with the treaty obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act is civil law and complements existing state law. This Act does not limit, contradict, or supercede the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. This Act is not meant to prevent a legitimate relocation action filed in accordance with the law of the state having jurisdiction to make a child-custody determination nor to prevent a victim of domestic violence from escaping abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act applies to predecree and intrastate cases, to emergency situations, and to cases in which risk factors exist and the current child- custody determination lacks abduction prevention measures. Only three states have enacted comprehensive child abduction prevention statutes;
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup14See Ark. Stat. Ann. § 9-13-401-407 (2005); Cal. Fam. Code § 3048 (2004); Tex. Fam. Code § 153.501- § 153.503 (2003).
    </p>
    <p>
     two other states include provisions to reduce the risk of abduction.
    </p>
    <p>
     &amp;sup15See Fla. Stat. § 61.45 (2005); Or. Rev. Stat. § 109.035 (2005).
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act will fill a void in the majority of states by identifying circumstances indicating a risk of abduction and providing measures to prevent the abduction of children, predecree or postdecree.

      <p>
       To the extent possible, the definitions track the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-101, et. seq., C.R.S.]. The definition of a child as a person under age 18 is the same as in Section 102(2) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-102 (2), C.R.S.]. State law determines when a child becomes emancipated before age 18. This Act is limited to the abduction of minors even though the risk of abduction may apply to a disabled adult who has an appointed adult guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "child-custody determination" is the same as the definition in Section 102(3) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-102 (3), C.R.S.]. This Act uses the traditional terminology of "custody" and "visitation" because that is the language used in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act although local terminology may differ. The definition of a child-custody proceeding differs insignificantly from Section 102(4) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-102 (4), C.R.S.].
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of abduction covers wrongful removal or wrongful retention. The definition is broad enough to encompass not only an abduction committed by either parent or a person acting on behalf of the parent but also other abductions. Generally both parents have the right to companionship and access to their child unless a court states otherwise. Abductions can occur against an individual or other entity with custody rights, as well as against an individual with visitation or access rights. A parent with joint legal or physical custody rights, by operation of law, court order, or legally binding agreement, commits an abduction by wrongfully interfering with the other parent's rights. A removal or retention of a child can be "wrongful" predecree or postdecree. An abduction is wrongful where it is in breach of an existing "child-custody determination" or, if predecree, in violation of rights attributed to a person by operation of law. The term "breaches rights of custody" tracks Article 3 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

       It is possible, even likely, that abduction situations will involve more than one state. Thus, there is a need for mechanisms for communication among courts, for testimony to be obtained quickly by means other than physical presence, and for cooperation between courts in different states. Sections 110, 111, and 112 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [sections 14-13-110, 14-13-111, and 14-13-112, C.R.S.] provide mechanisms to deal with these issues. States that do not have the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act may want to include these provisions or use some similar provision of existing state law.

       An abduction may occur before a child-custody proceeding has commenced, after the filing but before entry of a child-custody determination, or in violation of an existing child- custody determination. To obtain abduction prevention measures, either the court on its own may impose the measures or a party to a child custody proceeding or an individual or entity having the right to seek custody may file a petition seeking abduction prevention measures.
      </p>
      <p>
       A court hearing a child custody case may determine that the evidence shows a credible risk of abduction. Therefore, even without a party filing a petition under this Act, the court on its own motion can impose appropriate abduction prevention measures. Usually, however, a parent who fears that the other parent or family members are preparing to abduct the child will file a petition in an existing custody dispute. An individual or other entity, such as the state child welfare agency, which has a right to lawful custody may file a petition alleging a risk of abduction and seeking prevention measures with respect to a child who is not yet the subject of a child-custody determination.

       This Act complements, but does not limit, contradict, or supercede the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 9 U.L.A. Part I 657 (1999), or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, 9 U.L.A. Part I 115 (1988). A court must have jurisdiction sufficient to make an initial child-custody determination, a modification, or temporary emergency jurisdiction to issue prevention measures under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act prioritizes the child's home state as the primary jurisdictional basis; prohibits a court in one state from exercising jurisdiction if a valid custody proceeding is already pending in another state; and requires that states give full faith and credit to sister state decrees made in accordance with its principles. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act follows the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       A court has temporary emergency jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act only if the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child, or a sibling or parent of the child, is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse. This Act equates a credible risk of abduction with threatened mistreatment or abuse for emergency jurisdiction purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a state would be able to exercise emergency jurisdiction under Section 204 the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-204, C.R.S.], it can do so even if another court has issued a child-custody determination and has continuing exclusive jurisdiction. The reference to Section 204 brings in all of its provisions that include communication, length of time of temporary orders, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 208 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-208, C.R.S.], if a court has jurisdiction because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction. However, as the comment to Section 208 explains, domestic violence victims should not be charged with unjustifiable conduct for conduct that occurred in the process of fleeing domestic violence. Domestic violence also shall be considered in a court's inconvenient forum analysis under Section 207(b)(1) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-207 (2)(a), C.R.S.].

      <p>
       The contents of the petition follow those for pleadings under Section 209 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-209, C.R.S.]. The information is made subject to state law [section 14-13-209 (5), C.R.S.] on the protection of names or identifying information in certain cases. A number of states have enacted laws relating to the protection of victims in domestic violence and child abuse cases by keeping confidential the victims' names, addresses, and other information. These procedures must be followed if the state law requires their applicability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement for information on domestic violence or child abuse is to alert the court to the possibility that a batterer or abuser is attempting to use the Act. Domestic violence underlies large numbers of parental kidnapping. One study found that approximately one half of abductors had been violent toward the other parent during the marriage or relationship. Some batterers abduct their children during or after custody litigation; others abduct before initiating legal proceedings. The court should not allow a batterer to use this Act to gain temporary custody or additional visitation in an uncontested hearing. A person who has committed domestic violence or child abuse poses a risk of harm to the child. Such a person, however, may still seek relief in a contested hearing where the issues can be fully examined by the court. In order to screen for domestic violence or child abuse, the petition requires disclosure of all relevant information and the court can inquire about domestic violence at any hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice and opportunity to be heard should be given according to the law of the state and may be by publication if other means are not effective. See Section 108(a) of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-108, C.R.S.].

       The list of risk factors constitutes a summary of the wide variety of types of behaviors and characteristics that researchers have found to be present. The risk factors are based on research that has been done during the last twelve years. Research also shows that abducting parents dismiss the value of the other parent in the child's life; have young children or children vulnerable to influence; and often have the support of their family and others. Parents who have made credible threats to abduct a child or have a history are particularly high risk especially when accompanied by other factors, such as quitting a job, selling a home, and moving assets. See Janet Johnston &amp; Linda Girdner, Family Abductors: Descriptive Profiles and Preventative Interventions (U.S. Dep't of Justice, OJJDP 2001 NCJ 182788); ABA, Early Identification of Risk Factors for Parental Abduction (NCJ185026). The more of these factors that are present, the more likely the chance of an abduction. However, the mere presence of one or more of these factors does not mean that an abduction will occur just as the absence of these factors does not guarantee that no abduction will occur. Some conduct described in the factors can be done in conjunction with a relocation petition, which would negate an inference that the parent is planning to abduct the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       International abductions pose more obstacles to return of a child than do abductions within the United States. Courts should consider evidence that the respondent was raised in another country and has family support there, has a legal right to work in a foreign country and has the ability to speak that foreign language. There are difficulties associated with securing return of children from countries that are not treaty partners under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction or are not compliant with the Convention. Compliance Reports are available at the United States Department of State website or may be obtained by contacting the Office of Children's Issues in Department of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts should be particularly sensitive to the importance of preventive measures where there is an identified risk of a child being removed to countries that are guilty of human rights violations, including arranged marriages of children, child labor, lack of child abuse laws, female genital mutilation, sexual exploitation, any form of child slavery, torture, and the deprivation of liberty. These countries pose potentially serious obstacles to return of a child and pose the possibility of harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts need to be sensitive to domestic violence issues. Batterers often abduct their children before as well as during and after custody litigation. However, courts also need to be aware of the dynamics of domestic violence. Rather than a vindictive reason for taking the child, a victim fleeing domestic violence may be attempting to protect the victim and the child. Almost half of the parents in one parental kidnapping study were victims of domestic violence and half of the parents who were contemplating abducting their children were motivated by the perceived need to protect their child from physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Geoffrey L. Greif &amp; Rebecca L. Hegar, When Parents Kidnap: The Families Behind the Headlines 8 (1993). Some of the risk factors involve the same activities that might be undertaken by a victim of domestic violence who is trying to relocate or flee to escape violence. If the evidence shows that the parent preparing to leave is fleeing domestic violence, the court must consider that any order restricting departure or transferring custody may pose safety issues for the respondent and the child, and therefore, should be imposed only when the risk of abduction, the likely harm from the abduction, and the chances of recovery outweigh the risk of harm to the respondent and the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act recognizes that domestic violence victims should be considered. The Comment to Section 208 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Jurisdiction Declined by Reason of Conduct) [section 14-13-208,C.R.S.] states that "Domestic violence victims should not be charged with unjustifiable conduct for conduct that occurred in the process of fleeing domestic violence, even if their conduct is technically illegal. An inquiry must be made whether the flight was justified under the circumstances of the case."

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

      </h4>
      <p>
       This act provides courts with a choice of remedies. Ideally the court will choose the least restrictive measures and conditions to maximize opportunities for continued parental contact while minimizing the opportunities for abduction. The most restrictive measures should be used when there have been prior custody violations and overt threats to take the child; when the child faces substantial potential harm from an abducting parent who may have serious mental or personality disorder, history of abuse or violence or no prior relationship with the child; or when the obstacles to recovering the child are formidable due to countries not cooperating and enforcing orders from the United States, not being signatories to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction or non-compliant. This section of the Act lists the possible prevention measures categorized as travel restrictions, conditions on the exercise of custody and visitation, and urgent measures when abduction is imminent or in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person files a petition under this Act, even if the court decides not to order restrictive measures or impose conditions, the court may clarify and make more specific the existing child-custody determination. To enter an abduction prevention order, the court must have jurisdiction to make a child-custody determination even if it is emergency jurisdiction. The court should set out the basis for the court's exercise of jurisdiction. The more apparent on the face of the document that the court issuing the order had proper jurisdiction, the more likely courts in other states and countries are to recognize it as valid. The court should also include a statement showing that the parties were properly served and given adequate notice. This makes it apparent on the face of the order that due process was met. See Sections 108 and 205 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [sections 14-13- 108 and 14-13-205, C.R.S.]. States do not require personal jurisdiction to make a child- custody determination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may make an existing child-custody order clearer and more specific. Vague orders are difficult to enforce without additional litigation. The term "reasonable visitation" can lead to conflicts between the parents and make it difficult for law enforcement officers to know if the order is being violated. The court may specify the dates and times for each party's custody and visitation, including holidays, birthdays, and telephone or Internet contact. Because joint custody arrangements create special enforcement problems, the court should ensure that the order specifies the child's residential placement at all times. Whenever possible, the residential arrangements should represent the parents' agreement. However, to prevent abductions, it is important for the court order to be specific as to the residential arrangements for the child. If there is a threat of abduction, awarding sole custody to one parent makes enforcement easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may also include language in the prevention order to highlight the importance of both parties complying with the court order by including in bold language: "VIOLATION OF THIS ORDER MAY SUBJECT THE PARTY IN VIOLATION TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES."
      </p>
      <p>
       Because every abduction case may be a potential international abduction case, the prevention order should identify the place of habitual residence of a child. Although the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction does not define "habitual residence" and the determination is made by the court in the country hearing a petition for return of a child, a statement in the child-custody determination or prevention order may help. A typical statement reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       The State of ____________, United States of America, is the habitual residence of the minor children within the meaning of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the court finds a credible risk of abduction, this Act provides numerous measures to prevent an abduction. Courts can require a party traveling outside a specified geographical area to provide the other party with all relevant information about where the child will be and how to contact the child. The court can impose travel restrictions prohibiting the respondent from leaving the United States or a specific geographical area; from removing the child from school, day care or other facilities, and can restrict contact other than as specified in the order. The court may also impose passport restrictions and require the respondent to provide assurances and safeguards as a condition of traveling with the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may also choose to impose restrictions on custody or visitation. The most common, and one of the most effective, restrictions is supervised visitation. Visitation should remain supervised until the court decides the threat of abduction has passed. In addition, the court may require the posting of a bond sufficient to serve both as a deterrent and as a source of funds for the cost of the return of the child. If domestic violence is present, the court may want to order the abusive person to obtain education, counseling or attend a batterers' intervention and prevention program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of international abduction cases are the most complex and difficult, reasonable restrictions to prevent such abductions are necessary. If a credible risk of international abduction of the child exists, passport controls and travel restrictions may be indispensable. It may be advantageous in some cases to obtain a "mirror" or reciprocal order. Before exercising rights, the respondent would need to get a custody order from the country to which the respondent will travel that recognizes both the United States order and the court's continuing jurisdiction. The foreign court would need to agree to order return of the child if the child was taken in violation of the court order. This potentially expensive and time consuming remedy should only be ordered when likely to be of assistance. Because the foreign court may subsequently modify its order, problems can arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may do whatever is necessary to prevent an abduction, including using the warrant procedure under this act or under the law of the state. Many law enforcement officers are unclear about their role in responding to parental kidnapping cases. One study showed that 70 percent of law enforcement agencies reported that they did not have written policies and procedures governing child abduction cases. A provision in the custody order directing law enforcement officer to "accompany and assist" a parent to recover an abducted child may be useful but is not included in this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remedies provided in this Act are intended to supplement and complement existing law.

      <p>
       This section of the Act authorizes issuance of a warrant in an emergency situation, such as an allegation that the respondent is preparing to abduct the child to a foreign country and is on the way to the airport. The harm is the credible risk of imminent removal. If the court finds such a risk, the court should temporarily waive the notice requirements and issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child. Immediately after the warrant is executed, the respondent is to receive notice of the proceedings. This section mirrors Section 311 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [section 14-13-311, C.R.S.] on warrants to pick up a child which are available when there is an existing child-custody determination. In many states, the term used in civil cases is "writ of attachment."
      </p>
      <p>
       The court should hear the testimony of the petitioner or another witness before issuing the warrant. The testimony may be heard in person, by telephone, or by any other means acceptable under local law, which may include video conferencing or use of other technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Domestic violence includes "family" violence. Because some batterers may try to use the warrant procedure to prevent victims and the children from escaping domestic violence or child abuse, the court should check relevant state and national databases to see if either the petitioner or respondent's name is listed or if relevant information exists that has not been disclosed before issuing the warrant and ordering placement. Lundy Bancroft &amp; Jay G. Silverman, The Batterer as Parent: Addressing the Impact of Domestic Violence on Family Dynamics 73, 75 (2002)(indicating that most parental abductions take place in the context of a history of domestic violence because threatening to take the child from the mother is a form of control).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some courts have computer terminals on the bench and a database search takes seconds. Courts without computer access can seek the assistance of law enforcement. Unless impracticable, the court should conduct a search of all person databases of the National Crime Information Center system, including the protection order file, the historical protection order file, the warrants file, the sex offender registry, and the persons on supervised release file. In addition, it is recommended that courts run searches in the National Law Enforcement Telecommunication System in the petitioner's state of birth, current state of residence, and other recent states of residence. Civil courts are authorized by statute and National Crime Information Center policy to have access to information in several files for domestic violence and stalking cases. Because child abduction involves family members and can harm children, and violence between the parents is often a factor leading to child abduction, cases in which a parent alleges a risk of wrongful removal should permit access to the relevant databases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court should also view comparable state databases, such as the state department of social service registry of persons found to have abused or neglected children. If the petitioner or respondent are listed for a reason related to a crime of domestic or family violence, the court may refuse to issue a warrant or order any appropriate placement authorized under the laws of the state. The warrant must provide for the placement of a child pending the hearing. Temporary placement will most often be with the petitioner unless the database check reveals the petitioner is a likely or known abuser.

       The court must state the reasons for issuance of the warrant. The warrant can be enforced by law enforcement officers wherever the child is found in the state. The warrant may authorize entry upon private property to pick up the child if no less intrusive means are possible. In extraordinary cases, the warrant may authorize law enforcement to make a forcible entry at any hour. This section also authorizes law enforcement officers to enforce out of state warrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section of the Act applies only to wrongful removals, not wrongful retentions. It does not hinder a court from issuing any other immediate ex parte relief to prevent a wrongful removal or retention as may be allowed under law other than this act.

        Any payment of public assistance by a county department of human or social services made to or for the benefit of any dependent child or children creates a debt, which is due and owing to the county department of human or social services, recoverable by the county as a debt due to the state by the parent or parents who are responsible for support of the dependent child or children, or by the parent whose rights were terminated pursuant to section 19-5-105.5 and who was ordered to pay child support for the benefit of a dependent child, in an amount to be determined as follows:
        <ol type="a">
         <li id="t14a14s14-14-104ol11a">
          Where there has been a court order directed to a parent, the child support debt of that parent is an amount equal to the amount of public assistance paid to the extent of the full amount of arrearages under the order. However, the county department of human or social services, through its delegate child support enforcement unit, may petition for modification of the order on the same grounds as a party to the action.
         </li>
         <li id="t14a14s14-14-104ol11b">
          Where there has been no court or administrative order for child support, the county department of human or social services, through its delegate child support enforcement unit, may initiate a court or administrative action to establish the amount of child support debt accrued, and the court or delegate child support enforcement unit, after hearing or upon stipulation or upon a default order, shall enter an order for child support debt. The debt must be based on the amount of current child support due, or which would have been due if there were an existing order for child support, under the current child support enforcement guidelines in effect on the date of the stipulation, default order, or hearing to establish the child support debt times the number of months the family received public assistance. The total amount of child support debt must not exceed the total amount paid for public assistance. A child support debt established pursuant to this subsection (1)(b) is in addition to any subsequent child support debt accrued pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section.

         Annotator's note.
        </b>
        Since § 14-14-111.5 is similar to § 14-14-107 as it existed prior to the 1996 repeal of said section, relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Statutory language is clear
        </b>
        that an order for wage assignment is mandatory if the obligor cannot establish one of the two specified defenses. Purpose of new subsection (2) was to effect a mandatory and expedited procedure for wage assignment when default in a child support payment occurred; provision for a limited hearing was included to afford the obligor due process. In re Barnes, 692 P.2d 329 (Colo. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Section clearly applies to maintenance, whether or not combined with child support.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Defense against wage assignment that the full amount claimed is not due is contemplated by section
        </b>
        and therefore success on such defense authorizes an award of attorney fees under section. In re Watters, 782 P.2d 1220 (Colo. App. 1989); In re Sabala, 802 P.2d 1163 (Colo. App. 1990).
       </p>

        <b>
         Attorney fee award to obligor must be reconsidered by trial court where obligee also prevails in part.
        </b>
        In re Sabala, 802 P.2d 1163 (Colo. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         There was a hearing on an objection where the amount due was stipulated prior to the hearing
        </b>
        because the issues at the hearing are limited to the identity of the obligor and the amount of the obligation, and an award of fees to the prevailing party is intended to discourage exaggerated claims or attempts to delay payment of valid claims. In re Vivens, 885 P.2d 301 (Colo. App. 1994).

        <ol type="a">
         <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol12-2.5a">
          The obligor is under a court order to provide health insurance coverage for a child;
         </li>
         <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol12-2.5b">
          The insurance provider shall notify the obligee, the obligee's representative, or the delegate child support enforcement unit of any cancellation of the coverage.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol13">
        No employer who complies with a notice to deduct for health insurance benefits pursuant to this section shall be liable to the obligor for wrongful withholding.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol14">
        No employer shall discharge or refuse to hire or take disciplinary action against an employee because of the entry or service of a notice to deduct for health insurance issued and executed pursuant to this section. Any person who violates this subsection (4) may be deemed by the court to be subject to contempt of court.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol15">
        An employer who wrongfully fails to deduct for health insurance in accordance with the provisions of this section may be held liable for an amount up to the accumulated amount of such premiums the employer or payor should have withheld from the obligor's wages.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol16">
        When an employer is served with a notice to deduct for health insurance pursuant to this section, and the obligor is no longer employed by the employer, the employer shall promptly notify the court in writing of the obligor's last-known address, social security number, and the name of the obligor's new employer, if known.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol17">
        If an employer discharges an employee in violation of the provisions of this section, the employee may, within ninety days, bring a civil action for the recovery of wages lost as a result of the violation and for an order requiring the reinstatement of the employee. Damages recoverable shall be lost wages not to exceed six weeks, costs, and reasonable attorney fees.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol18">
        A notice to deduct for health insurance issued and served pursuant to this section shall be continuing and shall remain in effect and be binding on any current or successor employer upon whom it is served until further notice by the court, obligee, obligee's representative, or delegate child support enforcement unit.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol19">
        The court, obligee, obligee's representative, or delegate child support enforcement unit shall promptly notify the employer, in writing, when a notice to deduct for health insurance is modified or terminated. A notice to deduct for health insurance shall be terminated when the court order requiring health insurance is terminated.
       </li>
       <li id="t14a14s14-14-112ol110">
        Deductions for health insurance shall also be ordered by a delegate child support enforcement unit under the provisions of the "Colorado Administrative Procedure Act for the Establishment and Enforcement of Child Support", created in article 13.5 of title 26, C.R.S.

      <p>
       The general assembly declares that the public policy of this state, as set forth in section 31 of article II of the state constitution, recognizes only the union of one man and one woman as a marriage. The general assembly declares that the purpose of this article is to provide eligible couples the opportunity to obtain the benefits, protections, and responsibilities afforded by Colorado law to spouses consistent with the principles of equality under law and religious freedom embodied in both the United States constitution and the constitution of this state. The general assembly declares that a second purpose of the act is to protect individuals who are or may become partners in a civil union against discrimination in employment, housing, and in places of public accommodation. The general assembly further finds that the general assembly, in the exercise of its plenary power, has the authority to define other arrangements, such as a civil union between two unmarried persons regardless of their gender, and to set forth in statute any state-level benefits, rights, and protections to which a couple is entitled by virtue of entering into a civil union. The general assembly finds that the "Colorado Civil Union Act" does not alter the public policy of this state, which recognizes only the union of one man and one woman as a marriage. The general assembly also declares that a third purpose in enacting the "Colorado Civil Union Act" is to state that Colorado courts may offer same-sex couples the equal protection of the law and to give full faith and credit to recognize relationships legally created in other jurisdictions that are similar to civil unions created by this article and that are not otherwise recognized pursuant to Colorado law.
