      UNIFORM UNINCORPORATED NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION ACT
      PREFATORY NOTE
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act reforms the common law concerning unincorporated, nonprofit associations in three basic areas -- authority to acquire, hold, and transfer property, especially real property; authority to sue and be sued as an entity; and contract and tort liability of officers and members of the association.
    </p>
    <p>
     At common law an unincorporated association, whether nonprofit or for-profit, was not a separate legal entity. It was an aggregate of individuals. In many ways it had the characteristics of a business partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
     This approach obviously created problems. A gift of real property to an unincorporated association failed because no legal entity existed to receive it. For example, a gift of Blackacre to Somerset Social Club (an unincorporated, nonprofit association) would fail because in law there is no legal entity to receive title. Some courts in time became uncomfortable with this result. Some construed such a gift as a grant to the officers of the association to hold the real estate in trust and manage it for the benefit of the members of the association. Later, some legislatures provided various solutions, including treating the association for these purposes as an entity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Proceedings by or against an unincorporated association presented similar problems. If it were not a legal entity, each of the members needed to be joined as party plaintiffs or defendants. Class action offered another approach. Again courts and legislatures, especially the latter, provided solutions. "Sue and be sued" statutes found their way on the law books of most states.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unincorporated associations, not being legal entities, could not be liable in tort, contract, or otherwise for conduct taken in their names. On the other hand, their members could be. Courts borrowed from the law of partnership the concept that the members of the association, like partners, were co-principals. As co-principals they were individually liable. Again courts and legislatures, responding to concerns of their constituents about this result, modified these rules. Courts found that, in large membership associations, some members did not have the kind of control or participation in the decision process that made it reasonable and fair to view them as co-principals. Legislatures also took steps. Perhaps most striking are the statutes adopted in many states in the last decade excusing officers, directors, members, and volunteers of nonprofit organizations from liability for simple negligence. There is great variety in the details; a few statutes condition the immunity on the association carrying appropriate insurance or qualifying under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c).
    </p>
    <p>
     Related to liability is the question of enforcement of a judgment obtained against an unincorporated association, its members, and its property. If fewer than all members are liable in contract or tort, the property that members own jointly or in common may not be seized in execution of a judgment without severing the interest of those who are liable from those who are not. Again, courts using "joint debtor," "common property," and "common name" statutes fashioned more workable solutions. Some legislatures have also addressed the problem directly. For these purposes, unincorporated associations have been treated as legal entities -- like a corporation.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is striking about the legislative treatment of these and other legal issues concerning unincorporated, nonprofit associations is that no state appears to have addressed them in a comprehensive, integrated, and internally consistent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act deals with a limited number of the major issues relating to unincorporated, nonprofit associations in an integrated and consistent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     The American Bar Association first issued its Model Nonprofit Corporation Act in 1964; it was most recently revised in 1987. The act deals comprehensively with nonprofit corporations, including troublesome questions of governance and membership. This Act, on the other hand, does not treat these and other questions. Enactment of this Act would leave these matters to a jurisdiction's common law or its statutes on the subject. It should be noted, too, that many states have statutes on special kinds of unincorporated, nonprofit associations, such as churches, mutual benefit societies, social clubs, and veteran's organizations. Which of these acts should be repealed and which retained in whole or part may require careful consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act applies to all unincorporated, nonprofit associations. Nonprofit organizations are often classified as public benefit, mutual benefit, or religious. For purposes of this Act, it is unnecessary to treat differently these three categories of unincorporated, nonprofit associations. Unlike some state laws, it is not confined to the nonprofit organizations recognized as nonprofit under Section 501(c) (3), (4), and (6) of the Internal Revenue Code. There is no principled basis for excluding any nonprofit association. Therefore, the Act covers unincorporated philanthropic, educational, scientific, and literary clubs, unions, trade associations, political organizations, cooperatives, churches, hospitals, condominium associations, neighborhood associations, and all other unincorporated, nonprofit associations. Their members may be individuals, corporations, other legal entities, or a mix.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Act is designed to cover all of these associations to the extent possible. To the extent a jurisdiction decides to retain statutes dealing with specific kinds of nonprofit associations, this Act will supplement existing legislation. As is pointed out in the Comments, a state electing to adopt this Act will need to examine carefully its statutes to determine which its wants to repeal, which to amend, and which to retain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The basic approach of the Act is that an unincorporated, nonprofit association is a legal entity for the purposes that the Act addresses. It does not make these associations legal entities for all purposes. It is left to the courts of an adopting state to determine whether to use this Act by analogy to conclude that an association is a legal entity for some other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should be noted, too, that many of the provisions are intended to be supplemented by a jurisdiction's existing law. For example, Section 5 (numbered as section 7-30-105 in C.R.S.) which provides for the filing of a statement of association authority, does not provide details concerning the filing process. It leaves to other law such details as whether the filing officer returns a copy marked "filed" and stamps the hour and date thereof, and the amount of the filing fee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two sections are bracketed as optional -- Section 12 (numbered as section 7-30-112 in C.R.S.) on venue and Section 13 (numbered as section 7-30-113 in C.R.S.) on service of process. A jurisdiction may decide that its present rules are consistent with the entity view of an association and provide the appropriate rule. Therefore, it would not adopt Sections 12 and 13 (numbered as sections 7-30-112 and 7-30-113 in C.R.S.). Both sections deal with only a part of the questions of venue and service of process. This means that if they are adopted they are only a part of the jurisdiction's law on the subject. And perhaps they should be placed in the court rules or statutes on those subjects instead of in the state's code with the other sections of this Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     A nonprofit organization wanting a comprehensive governance structure might consider incorporating under a nonprofit corporation statute, particularly one that follows the format of the ABA Model Nonprofit Corporation Act. These statutes provide, among other things, comprehensive governance provisions. As this Act contains none, adoption of a substantial charter and bylaws would be required to obtain similar internal rules and structure.
    </p>
    <p>
     There has been concern that this Act may deter nonprofit organizations from incorporating and that failure to incorporate would deprive the public of protections incorporation would provide. Clearly, incorporation does provide governmental involvement that this Act does not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most jurisdictions regulate solicitation by charitable organizations. Many of these are comprehensive. See, for example, Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 23, Sections 100-5121 (Smith-Hurd 1992); Minn. Stat. Ann. Sections 309.50-309.61 (West 1992); Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     These statutes frequently require, among other things, filing of a comprehensive statement with the attorney general before soliciting funds, including a copy of contracts with any professional fundraisers, and registration of professional fundraisers. A range of civil and criminal sanctions are provided. These statutes apply to all persons soliciting for charitable purposes, incorporated or not. In short, this Act's nonprofit associations are covered.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should be noted, too, that a nonprofit corporation or unincorporated, nonprofit association is not the only choice. The Uniform Law Foundation, like many Illinois foundations, is organized as a charitable trust. Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 14, Sections 51-69, (Smith-Hurd 1992); Uniform Supervision of Trustees for Charitable Purposes Act. Finally, it should be repeated that this Act is needed for the informal nonprofit organizations that do not have legal advice and so may not consider whether to incorporate.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       1. With respect to relations external to a nonprofit association, whether a person is a member of the organization determines principally a member's responsibility to third parties. Internally, whether a person is a member might determine specified rights and responsibilities, including access to facilities, voting, and obligation to pay dues. This Act is concerned only with determining whether a person is a member for purposes of external relations, such as liability to third parties on a contract of the nonprofit association. Therefore, "member" is defined in terms appropriate to these purposes. "Member" includes a person who has sufficient right to participate in the affairs of a nonprofit association so that under common law the person would be considered a co-principal and so liable for contract and tort obligations of the nonprofit association.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition may reach somewhat beyond decisions of some courts. Either participation in the selection of the leadership or in the development of policy is enough. Both are not required. This broad definition of member ensures that the insulation from liability is provided in all cases in which the common law might have imposed liability on a person, simply because the person was a member.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. A fundraising device commonly used by many nonprofit associations is the membership drive. In most cases the contributors are not members for purposes of this Act. They are not authorized to "participate in the selection of persons authorized to manage the affairs of the nonprofit association or in the development of policy." Simply because an association calls a person a member does not make the person a member under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) nevertheless protects "a person considered to be a member by a nonprofit association" even though the person is not within the definition of member in paragraph (subsection) (1).
      </p>
      <p>
       3. The role of a member in the affairs of an association is described as "may participate in the selection" instead of "may select or elect" the governing board and officers and "may participate ... in the development of policy" instead of "may determine" policy. This accommodates the Act to a great variation in practices and organizational structures. For example, some nonprofit associations permit the president or chair to name some members of the governing board, such as by naming the chairs of principal committees who are designated ex officio members of the governing board. Similarly, the role in determination of policy is described in general terms. "Persons authorized to manage the affairs of the association" is used in the definition instead of president, executive director, officer, member of governing board, and the like. Given the wide variety of organizational structures of nonprofit association to which this Act applies and the informality of some of them the more generic term is more appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. "Person" instead of individual is used to make it clear that associations covered by this Act may have individuals, corporations, and other legal entities as members. Unincorporated, nonprofit trade associations, for example, commonly have corporations as members. Some national and regional associations of local government officials and agencies have governmental units or agencies as members.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Paragraph (Subsection) (2) defines "nonprofit association." The model American Bar Association acts deal with both for-profit and nonprofit corporations. Unincorporated, for-profit organizations are largely covered by the uniform partnership acts. The differences between for-profit and nonprofit, unincorporated organizations are so significant that it would be impractical to cover both in a single act. Therefore, this Act deals only with nonprofit organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       6. The term "nonprofit association" is used instead of "association" for several reasons. The risk that this Act when placed in a state's code would be construed to apply to both nonprofit and for-profit associations should thus be avoided. Acts dealing with one kind of association when placed in a code have sometimes lost their identification and been inadvertently applied to the other kind where the term "association" alone was used. For example, the New York Joint-Stock Association Act of 1894 used the term "association," which it defined to include only for-profit organizations. "Association" was held in 1938 to include an unincorporated political party and the act applied to it.
       <i>
        Democratic Organization of Richmond County v. Democratic Organization of Richmond County
       </i>
       , 1 N.Y.S.2d 349 (1938). Subsequent decisions applied the act to other unincorporated, nonprofit organizations. The use of "nonprofit association" instead of merely "association" should also avoid the risk of this Act being improperly used to develop a common law rule by analogy from this Act to apply in a case involving a for-profit association. Roscoe Pound,
       <i>
        Common Law and Legislation
       </i>
       , 21 Harv. L. Rev. 383 (1908); Robert F. Williams,
       <i>
        Statutes as Sources of Law Beyond their Terms in Common Law Cases
       </i>
       , 50 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 554 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legal issues concerning unincorporated, for-profit associations that are not partnerships and so not controlled by a partnership act would be governed by a state's other statutory or common law. Resort to one of the two partnership acts for the purposes of developing a common law rule by analogy would be appropriate. Resort for this purpose to this Act in the case of an unincorporated, for-profit association would not be appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       7. Two or more persons is the common statutory requirement to constitute an unincorporated, nonprofit association. New Jersey, on the other hand, requires that there be seven or more members to be an association under its laws. This Act suggests the smaller number -- two. Consideration was given to specifying "one" instead of "two." For example, the developer of a condominium may have created a condominium association as an unincorporated nonprofit association. Before any units are sold the developer as owner of all units has all of the memberships in the association. Should it be treated as a nonprofit association under this Act from the beginning? It should not. Can one person be "joined by mutual consent for a common purpose?" To ask the question would seem to be to answer it. If the concern is to give the developer the entity protections provided by this Act, it is very likely that it already has some protection because it is a business corporation. Nevertheless, the number is placed in brackets, in part, to raise the question whether the number should be one or two or even a larger number.
      </p>
      <p>
       The members must be joined together for a common purpose. Several states provide that they be "joined together for a
       <b>
        stated
       </b>
       common purpose" (emphasis added). Because of the informality of many ad hoc associations, it is prudent not to impose the requirement that the common purpose be "stated." Very probably, it is the small, informal, ad hoc associations and those third parties affected by them that most need this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       8. "Nonprofit" is not defined. A common definition -- it is an association whose net gains do not inure to the benefit of its members and which makes no distribution to its members, except on dissolution -- does not work for all nonprofit associations. Consumer cooperatives, for example, make distributions to their members; but they are not for-profit organizations. Those consumer cooperatives not organized under specific state or federal laws need the benefits of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is instructive to note that the drafting committee for the ABA Model Nonprofit Corporation Act finally determined that it could not develop a satisfactory definition of nonprofit.

       9. The final sentence of paragraph (subsection) (2) is adapted from Section 201(d)(1) of Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA). This stresses that more than common ownership and use is required. For example, that three families own a lake cottage and share its use does not make the three families a nonprofit association. Paragraph (Subsection) (2) precludes arrangements that are merely common ownership from being a nonprofit association under this Act.

       1. This section is adapted from Uniform Commercial Code Section 1-103. The reference in Section 1-103 to "the law merchant" and its examples of supplementary rules, such as those of principal and agent and estoppel, were deleted as irrelevant or incomplete and unnecessary. This change in language does not manifest any change in substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. This Act contains no rules concerning governance. However, recourse to rules of governance must be had to apply some of the Act's rules. For example, whether a nonprofit association is liable under a contract made for it by an individual depends on whether the individual had the necessary authority to act as agent. Was the individual given the authority by someone empowered by the nonprofit association to give the authority? To decide a case like this a court must resort to the rules of the nonprofit association or, if there are none applicable or none at all, to the common law or other statutory law of the jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Efforts were made to develop default internal rules of governance -- applicable if an association had none or none that were applicable. This effort demonstrated the complexity and difficulty of fashioning rules that would reasonably fit a wide variety of nonprofit associations -- large and small, public benefit, mutual benefit, and religious, and of short and indefinite duration. It was thought best to leave this question to other law of the jurisdiction.

       This section is consistent with Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws Section 223 (1971). Section 3 (numbered as section 7-30-103 in C.R.S.) makes a conveyance or devise of land located in a state that has adopted this Act effective even though it would not be effective under the law of the state in which the nonprofit association has its principal office or other significant relationship. No relationship of the nonprofit association other than that the property is situated in the state is required.

       1. Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) is based on Section 3-102(8), Uniform Common Interest Act. It reverses the common law rule. Inasmuch as an unincorporated, nonprofit association was not a legal entity at common law, it could not acquire, hold, or convey real or personal property. Harold J. Ford,
       <i>
        Unincorporated Non-Profit Associations
       </i>
       1-45 (Oxford Univ. Press 1959), 15 A.L.R. 2d 1451 (1951); Warburton,
       <i>
        The Holding of Property by Unincorporated Associations
       </i>
       , Conveyancer 318 (September-October 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       2. This strict common law rule has been modified in various ways in most jurisdictions by courts and statutes. For example, courts have held that a gift by will or inter vivos transfer of real property to a nonprofit association is not effective to vest title in the nonprofit association but is effective to vest title in the officers of the association to hold as trustees for the members of the association.
       <i>
        Matter of Anderson's Estate
       </i>
       , 571 P.2d 880 (Okla. App. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       A New York statute specifies that a grant by will of real or personal property to an unincorporated association is effective if within three years after probate of the will the association incorporates. McKinney's N.Y. Estates, Powers, &amp; Trust Law, Section 3-1.3 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       California gives any "unincorporated society or association and every lodge or branch of any such association, and any labor organization" full right to acquire, hold, or transfer any "real estate and other property as may be necessary for the business purposes and objects of the society," and acquire and hold any property not so necessary for 10 years. California Corporations Code, Title 3, Unincorporated Associations, Section 20001 (West 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       As is the case with many of the problems created by the view that an unincorporated association is not an entity the statutory solutions are often partial -- limited to special circumstances and associations. Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) solves this problem for all nonprofit associations, for all kinds of transactions, and for both real and personal property.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Even if a nonprofit association's governing documents provide that it "may not acquire real property," subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) makes effective a transfer of Blackacre to the association. A different result would obviously disrupt real estate titles. The remedy for this violation of internal rules lies not in preventing title from passing but, as with other organizations, in an action by members against their association and its appropriate officers to undo the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) is a necessary corollary of subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) and, thus, it may be unnecessary. However, several states expressly provide that an unincorporated, nonprofit association may be a legatee, devisee, or beneficiary. See, for example, Md. Estates &amp; Trusts Code Ann. Section 4-301 (1991). Therefore, it is desirable to continue this as an express rule. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) applies to both trusts and contracts. Not all state statutes apply expressly to both.

      Colorado amended subsection (1) (numbered as subsection (a) in the uniform act) to require the execution and recording of the statement of authority, and, in subsection (2) (numbered as subsection (b) in the uniform act), required that the statement be recorded in the county in which the property is situated.

       1. This section is based on Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) Section 303. California Corporations Code, Title 3, Unincorporated Associations, Section 20002 (West 1991), is similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. A statement of authority need not be filed to conclude an acquisition of or to hold real property. It is concerned only with the sale, lease, encumbrance, and other transfer of an estate or interest in real property. For this, it should, but need not, be filed. The filing provides important documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Inasmuch as the statement relates to the authority of a person to act for the association in transferring real property, subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) requires that the statement be filed or recorded in the office where a transfer of the real property would be filed or recorded. This is usually the county in which the real estate is situated. This is where a title search concerning the real estate would be conducted. RUPA Section 303 provides for central filing, such as with the secretary of state, but its statement of partnership authority concerns authority of partners generally, not just with respect to real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. "Filed" and "recorded" are bracketed to direct an enacting state to choose. In most jurisdictions "recorded" will be the appropriate choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Subsection (c)(2) (numbered as subsection (3)(b) in C.R.S.) may present a problem for small, ad hoc, nonprofit associations. They may have no fixed office address. They may meet in the homes of their leaders. However, if they distribute literature or file petitions they are likely to have a mailing address.
      </p>
      <p>
       6. Subsection (c)(3) (numbered as subsection (3)(c) in C.R.S.) permits the statement to identify as the person who can act for the association one who holds a particular office, such as president. This designation relieves the association from the need to make additional filings on each change of officers. Under local title standards and practices the transferee and filing or recording office are likely to require a certificate of incumbency if the statement designates the holder of an office.
      </p>
      <p>
       7. Subsection (c)(4) (numbered as subsection (3)(d) in C.R.S.) requires the statement to document the authority of the person granted power to deal with the nonprofit association's real property and of the person authorized to execute the statement of authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       8. Subsection (d) (numbered as subsection (4) in C.R.S.) is designed to reduce the risk of fraud and to reflect law and practice applicable to other organizations. It requires someone other than the person authorized to deal with the real property to execute the statement of authority on behalf of the nonprofit association.
      </p>
      <p>
       9. Subsection (f) (numbered as subsection (6) in C.R.S.) makes a statement inoperative five years after its most recent recording or filing. This prevents a statement whose recording or filing is unknown by the association's current leadership from being effective. Reliance on a filing or recording this old is, in effect, not in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       10. Subsection (g) (numbered as subsection (7) in C.R.S.) is based on RUPA Section 303(h). Its obvious purpose is to protect good faith purchasers for value without notice who rely on the statement, including those who acquire a security interest in the real property. There remains, of course, the risk that the statement itself was unauthorized.

      <p>
       1. At common law a nonprofit association was not a legal entity separate from its members. Borrowing from the law of partnership, the common law viewed a nonprofit association as an aggregate of its members. The members are co-principals. Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) changes that. It makes a nonprofit association a legal entity separate from its members for purposes of contract and tort.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. This Act does not deal with liability of a member or other person acting for a nonprofit association for their own conduct. With respect to contract and tort Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) leaves that to the other law of the jurisdiction enacting this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Subsections (b) through (e) (numbered as subsections (2) through (5) in C.R.S.) are applications to common cases of the basic principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.). Because a nonprofit association is made a separate legal entity, its members are not co-principals. Consequently they are not liable on contracts or for torts for which the association is liable. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) specifies that result with respect to contracts.

       4. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) to relieve members and others from vicarious liability for the contracts of a nonprofit association.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Subsections (a) and (b) (numbered as subsections (1) and (2) in C.R.S.) eliminate a risk that existed under common law. An agent makes an implied warranty of authority to the other contracting party. If the purported principal does not exist, the agent obviously breaches the warranty. Because an unincorporated, nonprofit association was not a legal entity; one purporting to act for it breached this implied warranty.
       <i>
        Smith &amp; Edwards v. Golden Spike Little League
       </i>
       , 577 P.2d 132, 134 (Utah 1978). Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) treats a nonprofit association as a legal entity; therefore, an agent who acts for it within her authority does not breach the warranty.
      </p>
      <p>
       6. "Merely" because a person is a member does not make the person liable on an association's contract. This formulation means that there are special circumstances that may result in liability. For example, a member may expressly become a party to a contract with the nonprofit association. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) relieves members only of their vicarious liability. Liability for one's own conduct is left to the other law of the jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agent with authority from a nonprofit association who negotiates a contract without disclosing the agent's representative status is liable on the contract. Under agency law an agent acting within the agent's scope of authority for an undisclosed or partially disclosed principal is personally liable on the contract along with the principal, unless the other contracting party agrees not to hold the agent liable.

       </i>
       , 66 Marq. L. Rev. 134 (1984). Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) makes a nonprofit association a legal entity for these purposes. Therefore, as a matter of its other law a jurisdiction enacting this Act may appropriately apply this doctrine to a nonprofit association. In

       , 95 Ill.

He was found liable for a debt contracted in the name of the nonprofit corporation. See also Harry G. Henn &amp; John R. Alexander,

       7. An example of a partial statutory solution of members' liability for contracts of a nonprofit association is California Corporations Code, Title 3, Nonprofit Associations, Section 21100 (West 1991). It relieves members from liability for "debts or liabilities contracted or incurred by the association in the acquisition of lands or leases or the purchase, leasing, designing, planning, architectural supervision, erection, contraction, repair, or furnishing of buildings or other structures, to be used for purposes of the association." As noted earlier, partial and uncoordinated statutory solutions of common law problems are typical.
      </p>
      <p>
       8. Subsection (c) (numbered as subsection (3) in C.R.S.) applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) to relieve members and others from liability for torts for which the nonprofit association is liable. Inasmuch as Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) provides that a member is not a co-principal, the member cannot be considered to be an employer of the employee who committed the tort. Again, only relief from vicarious liability is provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability of a member or other person who acts for the nonprofit association is governed by other law of the jurisdiction. That an employer is liable for a tort committed by its employee does not excuse the employee.
      </p>
      <p>
       9. The immunity from vicarious liability provided by subsections (b) and (c) (numbered as subsections (2) and (3) in C.R.S.) does not depend on the remedy sought. Whether it is for damages for breach of contract or tort, unjust enrichment, or the like the immunity is provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       10. Since the mid 1980's all states have enacted laws providing officers, board members, and other volunteers some protection from liability for their own negligence. The statutes vary greatly as to who is covered, for what conduct protection is given, and the conditions imposed for the freedom from liability. Some apply only to nonprofit corporations.
       <i>
        State Liability Laws for Charitable Organizations and Volunteers
       </i>
       (Nonprofit Risk Management &amp; Insurance Institute, 1990);
       <i>
        Developments, Nonprofit Corporations
       </i>
       , 105 Harv. L. Rev. 1578, 1685-1696 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1987 Texas act, for example, relieves directors, officers, and other volunteers from liability for simple negligence that causes death, damage, or injury if the volunteer acted in the scope of her duties for a charitable organization exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) or (4). The act also limits the amounts that may be recovered from an employee or the organization if the organization carries requisite liability insurance. The constitutionality of the provision relieving volunteers from liability has been questioned under Article I, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution -- the Open Courts provision. Note,
       <i>
        The Constitutionality of the Charitable Immunity and Liability Act 1987
       </i>
       , 40 Baylor L. Rev. 657 (1988). Some statutes premise all relief upon the organization having specified liability insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) does not affect these statutes. As noted earlier Section 6 deals only with vicarious liability. These statutes concern liability for one's own conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       11. Although not a concern of Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.), perhaps it should be noted that nonprofit organizations have been held liable for tortious acts and omissions not only of employees but also of members. In
       <i>
        Guyton v. Howard
       </i>
       , 525 So.2d 948 (Fl. App. 1988) a nonprofit organization was held liable for the negligence of members who acted for the organization in conducting an initiation that resulted in injury.
      </p>
      <p>
       12. Subsection (d) (numbered as subsection (4) in C.R.S.) applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) to reverse the common law rule that the negligence of an employee of an association is imputed to its members. A member as co-principal was vicariously responsible for an employee's conduct within the scope of the employee's duties. Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.), however, makes the nonprofit association a legal entity. Thus, a member is not a co-principal and the employee's negligence is not imputed to a member.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the employee's negligence is not imputed, the member's suit against the nonprofit association for negligence by the employee is not subject to the defense of contributory negligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some courts treated large nonprofit associations as entities for some purposes and so did not impute the negligence of an employee to a member. Therefore, a member could recover from the association.
       <i>
        Marshall v. International Longshoreman's and Warehouseman's Union
       </i>
       , 57 Cal.2d 781, 371 P.2d 987 (1962); Judson A. Crane,

        Liability of an Unincorporated Association for Tortious Injury to a Member
       </i>
       , 16 Vand. L. Rev. 319, 323 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       13. Subsection (e) (numbered as subsection (5) in C.R.S.) applies the principle in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) to reverse the common law rule that a member may not sue the member's unincorporated, nonprofit association. A member as co-principal is logically a defendant as well as a plaintiff in such an action. The logic is that one may not sue oneself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) makes an unincorporated nonprofit association a legal entity. Therefore, a member is separate from the nonprofit association. There is thus no logical obstacle to either suing the other. A nonprofit association may, for example, sue a member for delinquent dues. See, for example, Section 6.13 ABA Nonprofit Corporation Act (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       14. The Texas Supreme Court recently overruled the common law rule and held that a member may sue the unincorporated, nonprofit association of which the person is a member.
       <i>
        Cox v. Thee Evergreen Church
       </i>
       , 836 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. 1992). The court also overturned the Texas common law rule that the negligence of an employee is imputed to a member. The court referred to a statute authorizing a nonprofit association to sue and be sued and other Texas statutes giving entity status for limited purposes to unincorporated, nonprofit associations. It did not, however, rely on them in overturning the historic common law rule. It simply found the old rule not suitable for present times. The court also followed recent developments in other courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       15. Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) relieves from vicarious liability not only members but also certain others. Persons who are "authorized to participate in the management of the affairs of the nonprofit association" are protected. Persons within this group -- largely directors and officers, however denominated -- are likely also to be members as defined in Section 1(1) (numbered as section 7-30-101 (1) in C.R.S.), and protected as such. If they are not members (i.e. not co-principals) they should not be found liable at common law. Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) extends protection to this group out of abundant caution. It is possible that a court might misapply the common law rationale for liability to hold a non-member manager vicariously liable. Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) prevents that somewhat remote possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) also extends protection to a person who is not within the definition of "member" in Section 1(1) (numbered as section 7-30-101 (1) in C.R.S.) but is "considered to be a member by the nonprofit association." A person within this clause is one who does not have the relationship to the nonprofit association that would permit a finding under the common law that the person is a co-principal. Also the person is not a director, officer, or manager within the preceding phrase. That a person not within the two preceding phrases but within the third phrase might be found vicariously liable seems quite remote. Nevertheless, Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) accords this person protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       As noted earlier, Section 6 (numbered as section 7-30-106 in C.R.S.) concerns vicarious liability only. Liability for one's own conduct is covered by other law of the enacting jurisdiction.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       1. Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) broadly recognizes the right of a nonprofit association to participate as an entity in judicial, administrative, and governmental proceedings, and in arbitration and mediation on behalf of it and its members. It may sue and be sued. Many states have enacted statutes granting unincorporated associations these rights. Many have rejected the argument that these acts made an unincorporated, nonprofit association a separate legal entity for other purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Section 1745.01 (Baldwin 1991) provides that an unincorporated association may "sue or be sued as an entity under the name by which it is commonly known and called." This formulation has an element that subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) does not have -- a description of the association name to be used. Maryland requires that the unincorporated association have a "group name." Md. Estates &amp; Trust Code Ann. Section 6-406(a) - (1991). As some of the informal nonprofit associations may not have fixed on a name but need the benefit of the rule, subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) does not require that it have a name.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) describes an association's standing to represent the interests of its members in a proceeding. It is the federal standing rule.
       <i>
        Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n
       </i>
       , 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S. Ct. 2434, 53 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1977). A nonprofit association must meet the three requirements only if it seeks to represent the interests of its members. If the suit concerns only the nonprofit association's interests, subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) does not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. If participation of individual members is required, the nonprofit association does not have standing. If the injury for which a claim is made or the remedy sought is different for different members, their participation through testimony and presenting other evidence is required. The typical case in which a nonprofit association has standing is where it seeks only a declaration, injunction, or some form of prospective relief for injury to its members.
       <i>
        Warth v. Seldin
       </i>
       , 422 U.S. 490, 515, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) does not require the nonprofit association to show that it suffered harm or has some interest to protect to have standing to represent the interests of its members.
       <i>
        Warth v. Seldin
       </i>
       , 422 U.S. 490, 511 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975). Some states require an association to have an interest to protect which is separate from that of its members. One court found that the probable loss of members if it did not take action on their behalf was a sufficient interest to protect to give it standing to represent its members. This approach certainly diminishes greatly the burden of satisfying the requirement. States have further modified the old standing rule. Recently many states have adopted the three-pronged federal rule, which is the rule in subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.).

       1. This section is consistent with Restatement (Second) of Judgments, Section 61(2), which provides: "If under applicable law an unincorporated association is treated as a jural entity distinct from its members, a judgment for or against the association has the same effects with respect to the association and its members as a judgment for or against a corporation ... ."
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Section 8 (numbered as section 7-30-108 in C.R.S.) applies not only to judgments but also to orders, such as an award rendered in arbitration or an injunction.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Section 8 (numbered as section 7-30-108 in C.R.S.) reverses the common law rule. Under the common law's aggregate view of an unincorporated association, members, as co-principals, were individually liable for obligations of the association.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Some states changed the common law rule by statute. Ohio, for example, provides that the property of an unincorporated association is subject to judgment, execution, and other process and that a money judgment against the association may be "enforced only against the association as an entity" and not "against a member." Ohio Rev. Code Ann., Section 1745.02 (Baldwin 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       An obvious corollary of this section is that a judgment against a nonprofit association may not be satisfied against a member unless there is also a judgment against the member.

      </h4>
      <p>
       1. Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) is not a dissolution rule. An inactive nonprofit association may not be one that has dissolved. It may have just stopped functioning and have taken no formal steps to dissolve. It might possibly be revived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) gives a person in possession or control of personal property of a nonprofit association an opportunity to be relieved of responsibility for it. Compliance with the section provides a safe harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. "Inactive" is not defined. A nonprofit association that has accomplished its purpose, such as seeking approval in a school bond election, is very likely inactive. A nonprofit association that has stopped pursuing its purposes, collecting dues, holding elections of officers and board members, and conducting meetings, and has no employees would seem to be inactive.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Inactive" does not describe a nonprofit association whose sole purpose is to act should a specific problem arise. That there has been no activity because the problem has not arisen does not make the standby organization "inactive."
      </p>
      <p>
       A three year period of inactivity is suggested. It is unlikely that a nonprofit association that has been inactive for that period will begin functioning again. Thus, it is prudent to transfer its assets to someone likely to make appropriate use of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) applies only to personal property -- tangible and intangible. Unclaimed property acts also apply to both kinds of personal property. All states have some form of unclaimed property act. Therefore, the relationship of these acts to this Act must be examined.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1981) applies to certain intangible and tangible personal property. If the property has been unclaimed by the owner for five or more years it is presumed abandoned. Intangible property, such as checking and savings accounts and uncollected dividends, is the main concern of these Acts. The obligor, such as a bank or other financial institution and corporation, is directed to report and turn over the property to the state administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only tangible personal property to which the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1981) applies is that in "a safe deposit box or any other safekeeping repository." Many states have additional statutes that apply to property abandoned in airport, bus, and railroad lockers and the like. Tangible personal property of an inactive nonprofit association in the control or possession of a member or other person is not likely to be in these places. Therefore, overlap of this Act with the other state acts with respect to tangible personal property is likely to be very limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Property of an inactive nonprofit association is likely to be in the possession or control of a former member, board member, officer, or employee. Especially with respect to intangible property, their relation to the property is unlike that of those regulated by the unclaimed property acts. They are custodians or fiduciaries and not obligors. Those upon whom duties are imposed by the unclaimed property acts are obligors on such intangible property as bank accounts, money orders, life insurance policies, and utility deposits. The person acting under Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) is very unlikely to be in the position of an obligor on such intangible property. In summary, there appears to be limited overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other special statutes may apply, such as laws governing unexpended campaign funds. Texas, for example, permits a person to retain political contributions for six years after the person is no longer an office-holder or candidate. It gives the person six choices of transferees, including a "recognized tax exempt charitable organization formed for educational, religious or scientific purposes." Tex. Code Ann. Elections Section 251.012(d) and (e) (Vernon's 1986). Minnesota provides that if an unincorporated religious society "ceases to exist or to maintain its organization" title to its real and personal property vests in the "next higher governing or supervisory" body of the same denomination. Minn. Stat. Ann. Section 315.37 (West 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) does not address what should be done with real property of an inactive nonprofit association. This seems justified. A nonprofit association owning real property of significant value is unlikely to become inactive. In the rare case that it does, the assistance of a court may be obtained in making appropriate disposition of the real property, primarily to ensure good title.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. To obtain a Section 501(c)(3) tax classification as a nonprofit organization an association must specify a distribution of assets on dissolution that satisfies the Internal Revenue Code. To avoid the interpretation that Section 9 (numbered as section 7-30-109 in C.R.S.) might be construed to override an approved distribution provision in an association's governing document the primacy of that distribution provision is expressly recognized in paragraph (1) (numbered as subsection (1)(a) in C.R.S.).
      </p>
      <p>
       6. If there is no bylaw or other controlling document the person may transfer the personal property to another nonprofit organization or a government or governmental entity. The nonprofit organization need not have the same nonprofit purpose as the inactive one. It is enough that the transferee's purpose is "broadly similar." This requirement should not be construed narrowly. Otherwise, the risk of potential litigation over the transferor's choice will frustrate the section's purpose to provide a safe harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no limitation with respect to the choice of a government or governmental entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       7. Inasmuch as the transfer is made without consideration and the association almost certainly rendered insolvent, creditors of a nonprofit association would be protected by the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act Sections 4(a) and 5 and similar statutes. Whether they would also be protected if the transfer is made to the administrator of an unclaimed property statute depends on the terms of a jurisdiction's act. Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1981) Sections 20 and 24 contemplate that a creditor may proceed against property in the hands of the administrator if the creditor claims an interest in the property, such as a security interest or judgment lien. However, a general creditor without some claim against the property would not be protected. It is unlikely that an inactive nonprofit association would have both unpaid creditors and a significant amount of property. Therefore, the two issues discussed above are unlikely to arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       8. The person in possession or control is not required to give notice of the proposed transfer to anyone. An examination of to whom notice might reasonably be given reveals the difficulty with such a requirement. Almost by definition an inactive nonprofit association has no current members.

       1. This section authorizes but does not require a nonprofit association to file a statement authorizing an agent to receive service of process. It is, of course, not the equivalent of filing articles of incorporation. However, some nonprofit associations may find it prudent to file. Filing may assure that the nonprofit association's leadership gets prompt notice of any lawsuit filed against it. Also, depending upon the jurisdiction's other laws, filing gives some public notice of the nonprofit association's existence and address.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Central filing with a state official is provided. This is where parties will seek information of this kind and where this is commonly publicly filed.
      </p>

       3. The format of this section is very much like Section 5 (numbered as section 7-30-105 in C.R.S.), which concerns a statement of authority with respect to property. Because one requires local and other central filing they are not combined.

       This provision reverses the common law rule of partnerships, which courts often extended to unincorporated, nonprofit associations. Uniform Partnership Act Sections 29 and 31(4). This Act's entity approach requires this change of the old common law rule. Similar provisions are found in many state statutes. See, for example, Ohio Rev. Code Ann., Corporations, Section 1745.04 (Baldwin 1991); Md. Ann. Code art. 6-406(a)(2); and 12 Vt. Stat. Ann. Section 815 (Equity Pub. 1973).

       1. Venue, unlike service of process, is treated by statute. See for example Mont. Code Ann. Section 25-2-118(1) (1991); 28 USCA1391. A criterion used by all states for fixing venue is the county of residence of the defendant. Most states specify as many as eight additional grounds for venue, including the county in which the real estate that is the subject of the suit is situated and the county in which the act causing, in whole or in part, the personal injury or other tort occurred. None of these additional criteria present a special problem with respect to an unincorporated, nonprofit association.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. If an aggregate view of a nonprofit association were taken, the association is resident in any county in which a member resides. See Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, 15
       <i>
        Federal Procedure &amp; Practice
       </i>
       3812 (1986). Conforming to the entity view of an association, Section 12 (numbered as section 7-30-112 in C.R.S.) rejects the common law view.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is bracketed because some states have already satisfactorily solved this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       States have by statute modified the common law rule. Illinois, for example, provides that "a voluntary unincorporated association sued in its own name is a resident of any county in which it has an office or if on due inquiry no office can be found, in which any officer resides." Ill. Code Civ. Prac. Section 2-102(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Section 12 (numbered as section 7-30-112 in C.R.S.) makes a nonprofit association a resident of any county (or city) in which it has an office. If it has an office in five counties, for example, it may be sued in any of the five counties.
      </p>

       1. In most states the law with respect to service of process is in court rules. Where that is the case, this section, if adopted, should be placed in these rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Some states have expressly addressed service of process on a nonprofit association. Those states may wish to continue their rules and so should not adopt this section. For this reason this section is bracketed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 13 (numbered as section 7-30-113 in C.R.S.) adapts Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to this setting. However, it leaves to other applicable law details concerning service, such as who may make service and the kind of the mailing. It specifies only to or on whom the service of process must be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       By rule or statute all jurisdictions have extensive law on service of process. The real question for nonprofit associations is which set of these rules should apply. This Act treats a nonprofit unincorporated association as a legal entity. Thus, the rules applicable to another legal entity, the corporation, seem most appropriate.

       This Act provides an unincorporated, nonprofit association and its members with a legal structure that conforms to the expectations of many of them. Therefore, the need by the nonprofit association for additional time to revise procedures and forms to conform to a significant change in the law is not necessary. However, this Act materially affects third parties, particularly creditors of nonprofit associations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many creditors place little reliance on their rights against members in extending credit. If they have any reservations about the creditworthiness of a nonprofit association they obtain guarantees from creditworthy members or insist on cash. To the extent that this is true, no change in credit policies is needed and so no extra planning time is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a jurisdiction's usual effective date rule provides little time for affected parties to learn of a new law, it is unnecessary to extend this Act's effective date.

      </h4>
      <p>
       1. Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) brings to fruition the parties' expectations that previous law frustrated. Inasmuch as the common law did not consider an unincorporated, nonprofit association to be a legal entity, it could not acquire property. A gift of real or personal property thus failed. Reference in subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) to the transfer as "purportedly" made identifies the document of transfer as one not effective under the law. Subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) gives effect to the gift. However, if parties were informed about the common law they may have treated the gift as ineffective. In that case, the final clause of subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) provides that the gift does not become effective when this Act takes effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) should not be read as a retroactive rule. It applies to the facts existing when this Act takes effect. At that time subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) applies to a purported transfer of property that under the law of the jurisdiction could not be given effect at the time it was made. Subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) belatedly makes it effective -- effective when this Act takes effect and not when made. The practical result of this difference in when the purported transfer is effective is that the transfer is subject to interests in the property that came into being in the interim. The nonprofit association's interest is subject, for example, to a tax or judgment lien that became effective in the interim. An intervening transfer by the initial transferor may simply be evidence that the "parties had treated the transfer as ineffective." If so, subsection (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) by its terms does not vest ownership in the nonprofit association.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Some courts gave effect to gift of property to an unincorporated, nonprofit association by determining that the gift lodged title in someone, often officers of the association, to hold the property in trust for the benefit of the association and its members. Subsection (b) (language removed in C.R.S.) addresses this situation. When the Act takes effect it authorizes the fiduciary to transfer the property to the association. If the fiduciary is unwilling or reluctant, the association may require the fiduciary to transfer the property to the association. In either case, the association will get a deed transferring the property to it which, in the case of real property, the association may record.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Jurisdictions may face one of three different legislative situations with respect to Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.). First, a jurisdiction may not have changed the common law. In that case, Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) fits its situation well. Subsections (a) (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) and (b) (language removed in C.R.S.) address the two approaches taken by the courts under the common law. Secondly, a jurisdiction may have changed the common law so as to make effective transfers of real and personal property to some but not all nonprofit associations. In this case Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) should be made applicable to those nonprofit associations that did not have the benefit of the special acts. Thirdly, some jurisdictions may have extended to all nonprofit associations the privilege of acquiring in their names real and personal property. In this case, the jurisdiction does not need Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) and so should not adopt it.

       5. Jurisdictions that have a statute like New York's concerning grants of property by will have a problem that needs special attention. The New York statute provides that a grant by will of real or personal property to an unincorporated association is effective only if the association incorporates within three years after probate of the will. McKinney's N.Y. Estates, Powers &amp; Trust Law Section 3-1.3 (1991). The grants by will that need attention are those that have not become effective by incorporation of the association and have not become ineffective by the running of the three year period. These grants seem entitled to the benefits of Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.). If so, some modification of Section 19 (numbered as section 7-30-118 in C.R.S.) may be required.

      Colorado amended § 7-30-119 (numbered as Section 20 in the uniform act) by adding an exception to the savings clause to accommodate the provision added to § 7-30-118. The official comment should be read with this change in mind.

       1. Section 20 (numbered as section 7-30-119 in C.R.S.) is adapted from RUPA Section 1006(c). It continues the prior law after the effective date of this Act with respect to a (i) "right accrued" and (ii) pending "action or proceeding." But for this section the new law of this Act would displace the old in some circumstances. The power of a new act to displace the old statute with respect to conduct occurring before the new act's enactment is substantial. Millard H. Ruud,
       <i>
        The Savings Clause -- Some Problems in Construction and Drafting
       </i>
       , 33 Tex. L. Rev. 285, 286-293 (1955). A court generally applies the law that exists at the time it acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Almost all states have general savings statutes, usually as a part of their statutory construction acts. These are often very broad. See, for example, Model Statutory Construction Act, Section 53. As this Act is remedial, the more limited savings provisions in Section 20 (numbered as section 7-30-119 in C.R.S.) are more appropriate than the broad savings provisions of the usual general savings clause. Section 20 (numbered as section 7-30-119 in C.R.S.) and not a jurisdiction's general savings clause applies to the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. "Right Accrued." It is not always clear whether an alleged right has "accrued." Some courts have interpreted the phrase to mean that a "matured cause of action or legal authority to demand redress" exists.
       <b>
        Estate of Hoover v. Iowa Dept. of Social Services
       </b>
       , 299 Iowa 702, 251 N.W. 2d 529 (1977). In
       <b>
        Nielsen v. State of Wisconsin
       </b>
       , 258 Wis. 1110, 141 N.W. 2d 194 (1966), a landowner brought suit after the repeal of an act granting a landowner the right to recover from the state for damages to her land caused by the state's failure to install necessary culverts and the like to prevent flooding. Before the act's repeal the landowner's land had been damaged by flooding caused by the state's failures. The court held that the statutory saving of "rights of action accrued" saved her cause of action. In both of these cases, conduct that gave rise to a cause of action had occurred before the act was repealed. It is said that it is not enough that there is an inchoate right. Apparently, there is no "accrued right" under a contract, for example, until there is a breach.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. "Action or Proceeding" Pending. The principal question is what is an "action or proceeding" for this purpose. "Action" refers to a judicial proceeding. "Proceeding" alone, especially when used with "action," is broader and so includes administrative and other governmental proceedings. It has been given the broader meaning. For example, in
       <b>
        State ex rel. Carmean v. Board of Education of Hardin County
       </b>
       , 170 Ohio 2d 415, 165 N.E. 2d 918 (1960) a petition to transfer certain land from one school district to another filed before a change in the law was a "pending proceeding" to be decided under the old law. Similarly, a request for permission to petition for an election to consolidate school districts was held to be a "proceeding commenced" so that the substance and procedure of the old law, which was materially different from the new, was preserved.
       <b>
        Grant v. Norris
       </b>
       , 249 Iowa 236, 85 N.W. 2d 261 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       5. RUPA provides that the Act does not "impair obligations of contract existing." This is not carried forward. This phrase is intended to save only obligations protected by the contracts clauses of state and federal constitutions. However, as it might be construed more broadly and the constitution would protect without the phrase, the phrase is not present in Section 20 (numbered as section 7-30-119 in C.R.S.).

       Whenever the corporate life of any such ditch or reservoir company has expired or is about to expire, the stockholders may vote upon the question of extending the life of such company for another twenty years, or for any other term provided by statute, by first giving notice of such intention by publication for two successive weeks in the newspaper printed nearest the place where the principal operations of said company are carried on. Such notice shall be signed by stockholders owning at least ten percent of the entire capital stock of said company, and shall state the place where and the time when the question of renewal shall be submitted to the votes of the stockholders of said company at the meeting held in pursuance of such notice, if a majority of the stock of the corporation is represented.

       The votes shall be taken by ballot, and each stockholder shall be entitled to as many votes as the stockholder owns shares of stock in the company or holds proxies therefor. If a majority of the votes cast is in favor of a renewal of the corporation, the president and secretary of the company, under the corporate seal of the company, shall certify the fact, and shall make as many certificates as may be necessary. The company shall record one certificate in the office of the recorder of deeds in each county in which the company does business and shall deliver to the secretary of state for filing pursuant to part 3 of article 90 of this title a statement of extension of term that states that the term of the company has been extended, the principal office address of the company, and the registered agent name and registered agent address of the company. The corporate life of the company shall be renewed upon such recording and filing of the declaration, and all stockholders shall have the same rights in the renewed corporation as they had in the company as originally formed.

       The board of directors of any water users' association formed under section 7-44-103 at any time may file a petition in the district court of the county in which the office of such water users' association is situated praying a judicial examination and determination of the question of the validity of the organization of the association, or of any power conferred by the articles of incorporation, or of any amendment to the articles of incorporation, or of any assessment levied, or of any act, proceeding, or contract of the association. Such petition shall state the facts wherein the validity of such organization, power conferred by the articles of incorporation, amendment to the articles of incorporation, assessment, act, proceeding, or contract is founded and shall be verified by a member of the board. Thereupon a notice in the nature of a summons shall issue under the hand and seal of the clerk of said court, directed to all stockholders, creditors, or other persons interested in said water users' association, naming it, which designation shall be deemed sufficient to give the court jurisdiction of all matters and parties involved and interested.

In reaching its conclusions in such causes, the court shall follow a liberal interpretation of the law and shall disregard informalities or omissions not affecting the substantial rights of the parties, unless it is affirmatively shown that such informalities or omissions led to a different result than would have been otherwise obtained. The Colorado rules of civil procedure shall govern matters of pleading and practice as nearly as may be.

No other or more specific description of the defendants shall be required.

Thereupon a notice in the nature of a summons shall issue under the hand and seal of the clerk of the court stating in brief outline the contents of said petition and showing where a full copy of the contract or proposed contract may be examined, such notice to be directed to the said defendants under the same general designations, which shall be deemed sufficient to give the court jurisdiction of all matters involved and parties interested.

Any stockholder in the plaintiff association or owner or mortgagee of land within a federal reclamation project affected by the contract proposed to be made by the association may answer said petition within twenty days or such further time as may be allowed therefor by the court. The failure of any person affected by the said contract to answer shall be construed, so far as that person is concerned, as an acknowledgment of the validity of the said association contract and as a consent to the modification of the said individual contracts with the association or with the United States, to the extent that such modification is required to cause the said individual contracts to conform to the terms of the contract or proposed contract between the plaintiff and the United States.

       Since § 7-45-101 is similar to § 7-45-101 as it existed prior to the 2006 repeal and reenactment of this article and to laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.

        The general assembly may delegate the power of collecting tolls
       </b>
       in return for a supposed public good with such restrictions as it may see fit to impose, and the grantee takes subject to all such limitations. Virginia Canon Toll Rd. Co. v. People ex rel. Vivian, 22 Colo. 429, 45 P. 398 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And by virtue of this section the grant to exact tolls is conferred
       </b>
       in express terms only upon corporations organized to construct and which do construct toll roads. Virginia Canon Toll Rd. Co. v. People ex rel. Vivian, 22 Colo. 429, 45 P. 398 (1896).
      </p>

       <b>
        Right to locate road.
       </b>
       The effect of this section, and the section giving right of condemnation for construction of roads, is to give a road company the right to locate its road on the general course designated in its articles of incorporation, and when so located, to construct, maintain, and operate the road on the line of location, subject to the conditions of condemnation, compensation, and other requirements of the provision. Riddell v. Animas Canon Toll Rd. Co., 5 Colo. 230 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But toll road cannot be located on any existing road.
       </b>
       Under this section it is clear that a toll road company may not locate its road, or any part thereof, upon any toll road previously existing or upon any public highway heretofore and as the time of the organization of such company used and traveled as such, except as it might be necessary to cross such road or highway. Lyons &amp; E. P. Toll Rd. Co. v. People ex rel. Sprague, 29 Colo. 434, 68 P. 275 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And such location results in forfeiture of franchise.
       </b>
       Where a toll road company located a considerable part of its road upon and along a previously existing toll road which at the time had been abandoned by the former toll road company for a period of more than 14 months and which had been repaired and traveled by persons living in the vicinity, the location was in violation of this section and the company thereby forfeited its franchise and right to collect tolls. Lyons &amp; E. P. Toll Rd. Co. v. People ex rel. Sprague, 29 Colo. 434, 68 P. 275 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Moreover, as long as the power to locate a road remains unexerted,
       </b>
       the lands upon which the exercise of the right may ultimately cast the easement are uncertain, and no given tract or parcel of land can be designated as charged with the easement. Riddell v. Animas Canon Toll Rd. Co., 5 Colo. 230 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Only one toll gate each 10 miles.
       </b>
       Under this section the board of county commissioners is powerless to authorize the erection of and taking of toll at more than "one gate to each ten miles". Central Rd. Co. v. People, 5, Colo. 39 (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Hence, wherever there are 2 gates or more, the distance between them must be
       </b>
       not less than 10 miles. Central Rd. Co. v. People, 5 Colo. 39 (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A toll road company may alienate all its tangible property and also the franchise to collect tolls,
       </b>
       but whatever limitations or burdens existed against it will still exist against its grantee. Virginia Canon Toll Rd. Co. v. People ex rel. Vivian, 22 Colo. 429, 45 P. 398 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But not the power to continue the franchise after it expires.
       </b>
       A toll road company cannot by conveyance made during its corporate life impart to another corporation or to a natural person the power to continue the exercise of a franchise to collect tolls after the franchise itself has expired by operation of law. Virginia Canon Toll Rd. Co. v. People ex rel. Vivian, 22 Colo. 429, 45 P. 398 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        For a toll road company cannot collect toll after the expiration of the term of its corporate existence.

      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that it is in the best interests of the state of Colorado to maintain this state's economic and commercial viability in the world of national and international commerce by providing incentives to encourage growth in existing industries and to attract new industry. To that end, foreign-trade zones are established, operated, and maintained pursuant to a grant of privilege from the foreign-trade zones board upon proper application in accordance with the "Foreign-trade Zones Act of 1934", 19 U.S.C. sec. 81. This article is enacted to allow designated corporations, including the city and county of Denver, to make application for such grant of the privilege to establish such a foreign-trade zone in Colorado.

      <p>
       The basic conception of a cooperative marketing association
       
       is that of a group of farmers who reside in the same vicinity acting together for their mutual benefit in the cultivating, harvesting, and marketing of their agricultural products, the association itself being merely a convenient instrumentality in the hands of the farmers for carrying on such activities. Indus. Comm'n v. United Fruit Growers Ass'n, 106
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 223
       </cite>
       , 103 P.2d 15 (1940).
      </p>

       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.

      <p>
       <b>
        This section recognizes two classes of corporations:
       </b>
       First, those originally organized under this article, and second, those that have adopted its provisions as provided in this section. Colo. Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Thede, 80 Colo. 529, 253 P. 30 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Association cannot accept benefits of article without being bound.
       </b>
       This section conjoins the words "that the corporation or association has determined to accept the benefits and be bound by the provisions of this article", and one cannot untwine these interlaced words and accord the benefits of this article to an association out of the fold, without disregarding this proviso, which cannot be done. Colo. Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Thede, 80 Colo. 529, 253 P. 30 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Hence, a corporation is not entitled to make a marketing contract without first complying with this section
       </b>
       as a matter of public policy. Colo. Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Thede, 80 Colo. 529, 253 P. 30 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And such a contract is void where there has been no compliance.
       </b>
       An instrument in the form of a standing marketing contract which is entered into after this article took effect, but with an association not organized under it, and which at the time the association enters into the agreement with its member it has not complied with or taken advantage of this section is void. Colo. Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Thede, 80 Colo. 529, 253 P. 30 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, a provision such as this section cannot legalize retroactively previously invalid contracts.

       It is hereby recognized that agriculture is characterized by individual production in contrast to the group or factory system that characterizes other forms of industrial production; that the ordinary form of corporate organization permits industrial groups to combine for the purpose of group production and the ensuing group marketing and that the public has an interest in permitting producers of agricultural products to bring to their industry the high degree of efficiency and merchandising skill evidenced in the manufacturing industries; that the public interest urgently needs to prevent the migration from rural to urban communities in order to enhance production of agricultural products and to preserve the agricultural supply of the nation; that the public interest demands that producers of agricultural products be encouraged to attain a more efficient system of marketing their products and procurement of the necessary equipment and supplies through cooperatives.

When such a summary is supplied, the commissioner or a representative of the commissioner may separately set forth an opinion, stating the reasons therefor, regarding the viability of the proposed venture.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Cooperatives limiting membership to agricultural producers may make and execute marketing or purchasing contracts requiring the members to sell or purchase, for any period of time not over ten years, all or any specified part of their agricultural products or specified commodities, goods, services, or input supplies exclusively to or through the cooperative or any facilities utilized or to be created by the cooperative. If such producers contract to sell to the cooperative, it shall be conclusively held that title to the products passes absolutely and unreservedly, except for recorded liens, to the cooperative upon delivery or at any other specified time if expressly and definitely agreed to in the contract. The contract may provide, among other things, that the cooperative may sell or resell the products delivered by its members with or without taking title to the products and pay over to its members the resale price, after deducting all necessary selling, overhead, and other costs and expenses, including interest or dividends on stock which shall not exceed eight percent per annum, and reserves for proper purposes.

        But such contracts are valid where there is a concurrence of the following conditions:

        But rejection by a marketing association of a growing contract and its refusal to release a member from his obligations under his membership contract was arbitrary

       and without just grounds or excused where the association, in its negotiations, had stated that the tendered contract was acceptable in all its terms and would be approved by the association on condition that another contract be entered into with it for the purchase of its members' crops for the three subsequent years, which the purchaser declined to do.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section provides that the bylaws or the marketing contract may fix as liquidated damages
        
        for the breach of marketing contracts specific sums to be paid by the members or stockholders to the association upon the breach of any of the provisions of the marketing contract regarding the sale, delivery, or withholding of products. Marvin v. Pueblo Dairymen's Coop., 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 601
        </cite>
        , 284 P.2d 238 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        And the term "liquidated damages" indicates
        
        the amount which the contracting parties agree is to be in satisfaction on account of the breach, with the amount thus agreed upon being enforceable. Marvin v. Pueblo Dairymen's Coop., Inc., 131
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 601
        </cite>
        , 284 P.2d 238 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Thus, since the payment or collection of the amount of liquidated damages specified puts an end to all claims
        
        in connection therewith, the matter of the right to a restraining order or injunction would depend entirely upon the conditions of the marketing agreement. Marvin v. Pueblo Dairymen's Coop., 131

If assignment is refused in writing, and in the judgment of the trustees there is no liquidity or market value and the costs involved in delaying the winding up of the affairs of the cooperative exceed the potential benefits, the trustees are authorized to assign the assets or future proceeds to any local or statewide nonprofit organization that has as one of its principal purposes education or community service. The trustees shall under no circumstances be liable to any member or equity holder in the cooperative for any claim on any assets assigned by the trustees pursuant to the authority of this section.

       On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the financial rights of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order issued under this subsection (1) constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's financial rights and requires the limited cooperative association to pay over to the creditor or receiver, to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment, any distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.
      </li>

       At any time before sale pursuant to a foreclosure, the limited cooperative association or one or more members whose financial rights are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.

        A partnership is formed when
        
        an agreement is entered into which clearly embodies every element necessary for the formation and creation of a partnership and when it is executed by the parties nothing further remains to be done to legally bring about a partnership relation. Roberts v. Roberts, 113

       <p>
        An express agreement is not required to create a partnership; a partnership may be formed by the conduct of the parties. Stratman v. Dietrich, 765 P.2d 603 (Colo. App. 1988); In re Winden, 120 B.R. 570 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1990).
       </p>

        And the partnership relation continues until it is dissolved
        
        either by mutual agreement or by action of the parties or decree of court. Thompson v. McCormick, 149
        <cite class="co_code">

       <p>
        Failure by a partner to contribute his share of capital
        
        does not necessarily negative existence of a partnership, as such failure may be waived by the other partner where, following execution of the agreement, the other partner authorizes and makes payments of profits to the noncontributing partner. Thompson v. McCormick, 149
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 465
        </cite>
        , 370 P.2d 442 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        An agreement providing "all profits and losses in this venture are to be borne equally
        
        by the parties", expresses a consideration in the form of mutual promises and is sufficient to bring about a partnership. Thompson v. McCormick, 149
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 465
        </cite>
        , 370 P.2d 442 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        And partner's liability for losses indicates right to profit.
        
        If a partnership incurs losses and there is no question but that a partner would be liable for his share of the losses under the terms of the partnership agreement, this clearly indicates that the parties intended that partner to have an equal share of the profits.

        A partnership can only be created by a contract of the parties

        And where there is no evidence indicating that the landlord-tenant relationship exists

         Assignment of right to profits.
        </b>
        Where a partner assigns his rights to profits, but the remaining partners have not agreed to admit the assignee as a partner, § 7-60-127 assures that the assignee does not become a partner without the consent of the remaining partners in contravention of § 7-60-118 (1)(g). Hence, the provision that the partnership is not dissolved merely protects the original parties from an unwanted partner or from a finding of partnership from the fact of the assignee's receipt of a share of the profits. Wester &amp; Co. v. Nestle, 669 P.2d 1046 (Colo. App. 1983).

        Where each party was to be separately and solely responsible for the expenses involved in the development of certain land into residential building sites, one party could have enjoyed an individual profit while the other might have sustained an individual loss.

         Effect of subsection (1)
        </b>
        is that the status of a partner, as both principal and agent of the partnership, serves as complete authority with respect to acts which are apparently within the usual course of the partnership's particular business, unless the other party knows that he has no such authority. This obviates the necessity of a specific written authorization from the other partners. Ball v. Carlson, 641 P.2d 303 (Colo. App. 1981).

        Each active partner a general agent.
        
        When acting in furtherance of the objects and business of the firm and within the scope of its business, one partner is clothed with the full powers of all the partners and is authorized to bind the firm in all transactions, for the very nature and purposes of a partnership association necessarily constitute each active partner a general agent of the firm.

        This section contemplates that real estate may be a partnership asset whether it is titled in the partnership name or in the name of one or more but not all of the partners;
        
        therefore, a written conveyance from a partner who contributes real estate to a partnership, although a factor to consider, is not required to convert the property into partnership property. Courts must look to the parties' intention to determine whether the property is a partnership asset, including consideration of: (1) The language of any partnership agreement; (2) the use of the property in the partnership business; (3) the listing of the property as an asset or liability in the partnership books and tax returns; (4) the construction of improvements on the property at partnership expense; (5) the payment of taxes and insurance premiums on the property out of partnership funds; (6) a party's declaration of intent when entering the partnership; and, generally, (7) the parties' conduct with respect to the property.

If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner's consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If a partnership obligation results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that obligation as if the purported partner were a partner in the partnership, and, if the partnership is a limited liability partnership, the purported partner's liability is subject to section 7-60-115 (2) as if the purported partner were a partner in the limited liability partnership. If no partnership obligation results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.

Where all the members of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results; but in all other cases it is the joint act or obligation of the person acting and the persons consenting to the representation.

         Trial court properly determined the allocation of losses of partnership
        </b>
        on the basis of the partners' ambiguous agreement and testimony by the partners. The court, however, erred in determining that compensation to one partner was an advance against profits to be earned, despite the partners' testimony and the court's earlier finding that the term "draw" in the ambiguous partnership agreement meant compensation to one of the partners in exchange for greater participation in the partnership.

         Purpose of section.
        </b>
        Where a partner assigns his rights to profits, but the remaining partners have not agreed to admit the assignee as a partner, this section assures that the assignee does not become a partner without the consent of the remaining partners in contravention of § 7-60-118 (1)(g). Hence, the provision that the partnership is not dissolved merely protects the original parties from an unwanted partner or from a finding of partnership from the fact of the assignee's receipt of a share of the profits.

        Partner has no right to receivership.

        Rather, receivership rests in discretion of the court.
        
        Equity will not lend its extraordinary aid of receivership for property of an alleged partnership, unless an actual partnership is shown; and then, it rests in the discretion of the court, since a receivership is an extraordinary remedy and should be exercised with the gravest of caution.

        Where a trial court renders judgment against a partnership as such when it is in fact dissolved when its assets and liabilities were transferred to a trust, it is harmless error which does not require reversal of the judgment by having joined the partnership, since if, in fact, the partnership has no assets and is a nonentity, then the judgment against a nonentity can do no harm and since the individual partners were also named parties, then they cannot escape personal liability for the partnership debts if the partnership is no longer existent as such.

        Since a limited partnership cannot exist without a general partner, a limited partnership dissolves when the limited partners are without their general partner. Skeen v. Harms, 10 B.R. 817 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1981).

       <p>
        During a specified term of existence or in the midst of a particular undertaking, a partnership
        
        may only be dissolved by a mutual agreement which settles the rights and obligations of the parties inter se or by judicial decree which determines such rights and obligations. Yoder v. Hooper, 695 P.2d 1182 (Colo. App. 1984), aff'd, 737 P.2d 852 (

         Appointment of bankruptcy trustee dissolves partnership.
        </b>
        A bankruptcy trustee cannot assume the position of general partner of a limited partnership where he is not the person with whom the limited partners contracted: thus, the partnership dissolves when the trustee is appointed. Skeen v. Harms, 10 B.R. 817 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1981).

       <li id="t07a60s7-60-146ol11">
        A limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership shall not make a distribution to a general partner to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership, other than liabilities to general partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of the partnership, exceed the fair value of the assets of the partnership; except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability. For purposes of this section and sections 7-62-607 and 7-62-608, the term "distribution" shall not include payments to the extent that the payments do not exceed amounts equal to or constituting reasonable compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program.
       </li>
       <li id="t07a60s7-60-146ol12">
        A general partner in a limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership who receives a distribution in violation of subsection (1) of this section, and who knew at the time of the distribution that such distribution violated subsection (1) of this section, shall be liable to the partnership for the amount of the distribution. A general partner in a limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership who receives a distribution in violation of subsection (1) of this section, and who did not know at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated subsection (1) of this section, shall not be liable for the amount of the distribution. Subject to subsection (3) of this section, this subsection (2) shall not affect any obligation or liability of a general partner under an agreement or other applicable law for the amount of a distribution.
       </li>
       <li id="t07a60s7-60-146ol13">
        Unless otherwise agreed, a partner in a limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership who receives a distribution from the partnership shall have no liability under this article or other applicable law for the amount of the distribution after the expiration of three years after the date of the distribution unless an action to recover the distribution from such partner is commenced prior to the expiration of the said three-year period and an adjudication of liability against such partner is made in the said action.

       it should be so stated, and its cash value given, for one of the essential precautions of the law is, that public notice must be given of the amount paid in so that the public may be enabled to estimate correctly the credit to be given to the partnership.

       The word "contributions" as it is used in this section is limited
       
       to the contribution to be made by the limited partner at the time of the formation of the partnership for the benefit of the partnership's creditors, as there is a clear general purpose and intent by the general assembly to encourage trade by authorizing and permitting a capitalist to put his money into a partnership with general partners possessed of skill and business character only without becoming a general partner or hazarding anything in the business except the capital originally subscribed.

     <p>
      Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all of the partner's partnership interest.

        A limited partnership that is void as to a limited partner is not void as to the general partners.
       </b>
       The general partners were liable because at the time the limited partnership's obligation to the lender arose, all parties had contracted in accordance with their belief based on the filing of a partnership certificate with the secretary of state that a limited partnership existed. Therefore, the general partners were jointly and severally liable when they executed a note and deed of trust to the lender. Also, because the limited partnership benefitted from the proceeds of the loan, the general partners were estopped from denying the validity of their acts on behalf of the limited partnership. Finally, regardless of when the limited partnership was dissolved, the general partners were not relieved of their personal liability for the partnership's obligations by virtue of the dissolution.

       7-62-1003. Security and costs.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any action instituted in the right of any domestic or foreign limited partnership, unless the contributions of or allocable to plaintiff to partnership property amount to five percent or more of the contributions of all limited partners, in their status as limited partners, or such contributions of or allocable to the plaintiff have a market value in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars, the limited partnership in whose right such action is brought shall be entitled, at any time before final judgment, to require the plaintiff to give security for the costs and reasonable expenses that may be directly attributable to and incurred by it in the defense of such action or may be incurred by other parties named as defendant for which it may become legally liable, but not including fees of attorneys. Market value shall be determined as of the date that the plaintiff institutes the action or, in the case of an intervenor, as of the date that the intervenor becomes a party to the action. The amount of such security may from time to time be increased or decreased, in the discretion of the court, upon showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or is excessive. The limited partnership shall have recourse to such security in such amount as the court having jurisdiction shall determine upon the termination of such action if the court finds the action was brought without reasonable cause.

The action shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner's interest, any offset due under subsection (3) of this section, and accrued interest and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8) of this section, the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection (7) of this section.

         The purpose of this section

        is to afford the public the means of ascertaining the individual names of persons doing business under a common name where such names could not be found in the common name itself. Smith v. Stubbs, 16 Colo. App. 130, 63 P. 955 (1901).

         But not when surnames used.

        This section does not apply to a partnership of two members doing business under a name composed of the surnames of the partners. Smith v. Stubbs, 16 Colo. App. 130, 63 P. 955 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor in case of nonresident partnership.
        
        A nonresident partnership having its principal place of business outside of the state from which it transacts business through salesmen coming into the state is not "doing business in this state" within the meaning of that phrase as used in this section, and consequently, it has no application to such partnerships. Doll v. Rodgers, 98
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 36

         Failure to comply with the provisions of this section is a matter of abatement
        </b>
        to be pleaded in the answer, and if not pleaded, one cannot raise the objection upon the trial of the case. Smith v. Stubbs, 16 Colo. App. 130, 63 P. 955 (1901); Rocky Mt. Seed Co. v. McArthur, 85 Colo. 1, 272 P. 1117 (1928).

       <p>
        Defense of plaintiff's failure to comply with this statute must be affirmatively pleaded, and where the defendants failed to so plead they are estopped from raising the objection at a later time. Zambruk v. Perlmutter 3rd Generation Bldrs., Inc., 32 Colo. App. 276, 510 P.2d 472 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         But an allegation in an answer that plaintiff has failed to file an affidavit
        </b>
        as required by this section and should not bring the action is a good defense, and a motion to strike it out may be properly denied. Elgin Jewelry Co. v. Wilson, 42 Colo. 270, 93 P. 1107 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, dismissal proper where variance between affidavit and caption in complaint.
        
        In an action by a party doing business under the trade name, a dismissal is proper where a variance is shown between the statutory affidavit on record and the caption in the complaint. Michard v. Myron Stratton Home, 144
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 251

       <p>
        However, upon correction of the caption,
        
        or the filing of a new trade name affidavit to conform to the complaint, the action may be reinstated. Michard v. Myron Stratton Home, 144

         And only issue at new trial is compliance with this section.
        </b>
        Where a cause of action is reversed on the ground that the plaintiff, an individual doing business under a trade name, has failed to file the affidavit required by this section, the only issue on a new trial is that of compliance with the statute. Wallace Plumbing Co. v. Dillon, 71 Colo. 224, 205 P. 950 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        For it is not necessary that there be a new trial as to any issue except
        
        the one as to the filing of a proper trade name affidavit, since plaintiff's failure to file the proper affidavit is merely a matter in abatement. Admiral Corp. v. Trio Television Sales &amp; Serv. Corp., 138

        Foreign corporation not excluded from transacting business under assumed name.
        
        The phrase, "any corporation existing under the laws of this state", in this section is not intended to exclude foreign corporations from the right to transact all or a part of its business under an assumed name. Admiral Corp. v. Trio Television Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., 138
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 157

        , 330 P.2d 1106 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hence, a foreign corporation can resort to court action
        
        to enforce its rights if it carries on its business in any name other than that adopted in the state where it is incorporated. Admiral Corp. v. Trio Television Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., 138
        <cite class="co_code">

       <p>
        And where a foreign corporation doing business in Colorado under an assumed name fails to comply
        
        with this section requiring the filing of a certificate with respect to such assumed name, such failure serves only to abate an action during the time the required certificate remains unrecorded. Admiral Corp. v. Trio Television Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., 138

         The following factors are considered in determining whether certain information is a trade secret:
        </b>
        (1) The extent to which the information is known outside the business; (2) the extent to which the information is known to those inside the business; (3) the precautions taken by the holder of the trade secret to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the savings effected and the value to the holder in having the information as against competitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended in obtaining and developing the information; and (6) the amount of time and expense it would take for others to acquire and duplicate the information. Harvey Barnett, Inc. v. Shidler, 143 F. Supp. 2d 1247 (D. Colo. 2001).
       </p>

         Indispensable to an effective allegation of a trade secret is proof that the matter is, more or less, secret.

       <p>
        The act of keeping a design secret does not necessarily mean that it is a trade secret.
        
        Rather, the design itself must be secret; focusing on the act of protecting the design's secrecy skips the first and fundamental step in the analytical process. Hawg Tools, LLC v. Newsco Int'l Energy Servs.,

         A trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics and components each of which, by itself, is in the public domain,
        </b>
        but the unified process, design, and operation of which, in unique combination, affords a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret. Harvey Barnett, Inc. v. Shidler, 338 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2003); Hertz v. Luzenac Group, 576 F.3d 1103 (10th Cir. 2009).

        <b>
         A trade secret can include a system where the elements are in the public domain,
        </b>
        but there has been accomplished an effective, successful, and valuable integration of the public domain elements and the trade secret gave the claimant a competitive advantage that is protected from misappropriation. Rivendell Forest Prods., Ltd. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 28 F.3d 1042 (10th Cir. 1994).

       <p>
        Adoption of a per se rule that a bid on a contract cannot be a trade secret as a matter of law is also declined. The statutory definition of "trade secret", together with evidence of value and of measures to protect disclosure, is broad enough to include a bid on a contract. Ovation Plumbing, Inc. v.

        Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages may include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.

         The statute of limitations begins to run once a plaintiff learns a defendant improperly disclosed trade secrets,
        </b>
        even though the defendant subsequently may also have unlawfully used those same trade secrets. Chasteen v. UNISIA JECS Corp., 216 F.3d 1212 (10th Cir. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of limitations on trade secret misappropriation claims begins to run not when a plaintiff can positively and directly prove misappropriation rather than independent development, but simply when the plaintiff has knowledge of sufficient facts
        
        from which a reasonable jury could infer misappropriation. Chasteen v. UNISIA JECS Corp., 216 F.3d 1212 (10th Cir. 2000); Gognat v. Ellsworth, 224 P.3d 1039 (Colo. App. 2009), aff'd, 259 P.3d 497 (
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 2011
        </cite>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        To bring a claim of trade secret misappropriation, one does not need to know the specific damage inflicted. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 363 F.3d 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute provides for a single accrual date for multiple misappropriations
        
        of a single trade secret or of multiple, related trade secrets, coinciding with the first date plaintiff has knowledge of sufficient facts from which a jury could reasonably infer misappropriation. Gognat v. Ellsworth, 224 P.3d 1039 (Colo. App. 2009), aff'd, 259 P.3d 497 (
        <cite class="co_code">

        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        By specifying that "a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim," statute evinces a clear legislative intent that multiple misappropriations by the same party be treated as a single claim for accrual purposes.

      A court determining whether to pierce the corporate veil of an LLC must tread carefully in light of subsection (2),
      
      particularly where the company in question is a single-member LLC and where management of the LLC is provided under contract by a management company. Sedgwick Props. Dev. Corp. v. Hinds,
      <cite class="co_code">
       2019 COA 102

      </h4>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section is the only part of the Colorado Limited Liability Company Act that addresses applying the common law principle of piercing the corporate veil in the limited liability company (LLC) context.
       </b>
       Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The plain language of subsection (1) does not prohibit a court from applying the equitable common law doctrine of piercing the corporate veil to hold a manager of an LLC personally liable for the LLC's alleged improper actions.
       </b>
       Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2009), overruled in Weinstein v. Colborne Foodbotics, LLC, 2013 CO 33, 302 P.3d 263.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        It is presumed that, in adopting subsection (1), the general assembly did not intend to create a safe harbor for LLC managers to perpetrate fraud and deceit.
       </b>
       To construe subsection (1) as precluding application of the common law doctrine of piercing the corporate veil to LLC managers would open the door to fraud. Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2009), overruled in Weinstein v. Colborne Foodbotics, LLC, 2013 CO 33, 302 P.3d 263.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Absent a statutory restriction, the common law piercing doctrine applies to LLC managers.
       </b>
       Because allowing a manager of an LLC to hide behind the LLC's cloak of limited liability would promote injustice, protect fraud, or defeat legitimate creditors' claims, the equitable common law doctrine of piercing the corporate veil may be applied to hold an LLC manager personally liable for the LLC's improper actions. Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2009), overruled in Weinstein v. Colborne Foodbotics, LLC, 2013 CO 33, 302 P.3d 263.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Absent statutory authority, the manager of an insolvent LLC does not owe the LLC's creditors the same fiduciary duty that an insolvent corporation's directors owe the corporation's creditors.
       </b>
       Since the LLC act does not extend corporation common law to an LLC in any instance except a veil-piercing claim, creditors of an LLC may not assert a claim of breach of fiduciary duty against managers of an LLC. Weinstein v. Colborne Foodbotics, LLC, 2013 CO 33, 302 P.3d 263 (overruling Sheffield Servs. Co. v. Trowbridge, 211 P.3d 714 (Colo. App. 2009)).

       This notice provision applies only where a third party seeks to impose liability on a limited liability company's (LLC) members or managers simply because of their status as members or managers of the LLC.
       
       When a third party sues a manager or member of an LLC under an agency theory, the principles of agency law apply notwithstanding the Colorado Limited Liability Company Act's statutory notice rules. Water, Waste &amp; Land, Inc. v. Lanham, 955 P.2d 997 (
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1998
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The general assembly did not intend this notice provision to alter the partially disclosed principal doctrine.
       </b>
       The legislature did not intend the notice language to relieve the agent of an LLC of the duty to disclose its identity in order to avoid personal liability. Water, Waste &amp; Land, Inc. v. Lanham, 955 P.2d 997 (Colo. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Where an agent fails to disclose either the fact that he is acting on behalf of a principal or the identity of the principal, this notice provision cannot relieve the agent of liability to a third party.

        When a third party deals with an agent acting on behalf of an LLC,

       the existence and identity of which has been disclosed, the third party is conclusively presumed to know that the entity is an LLC and not a partnership or some other type of business organization. Water, Waste &amp; Land, Inc. v. Lanham, 955 P.2d 997 (Colo. 1998).

     <p>
      On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member, the court may charge the membership interest of the member with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest thereon and may then or later appoint a receiver of the member's share of the profits and of any other money due or to become due to the member in respect of the limited liability company and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries that the debtor member might have made, or that the circumstances of the case may require. To the extent so charged, except as provided in this section, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee or transferee of the membership interest. The membership interest charged may be redeemed at any time before foreclosure. If the sale is directed by the court, the membership interest may be purchased without causing a dissolution with separate property by any one or more of the members. With the consent of all members whose membership interests are not being charged or sold, the membership interest may be purchased without causing a dissolution with property of the limited liability company. This article shall not deprive any member of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member's membership interest.

        Where there are no other members in the limited liability company (LLC), the debtor's bankruptcy filing effectively assigned her entire membership interest in the LLC to the bankruptcy estate,
       </b>
       and the trustee obtained all of the debtor's rights, including the right to control the management of the LLC. In re Albright, 291 B.R. 538 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2003).

        Because the trustee became the sole member of the LLC upon the debtor's bankruptcy filing, the trustee controls, directly or indirectly, all governance of that entity,
       </b>
       including any decision regarding liquidation of the entity's assets. Therefore, the trustee may cause the LLC to sell its property and distribute net proceeds to the bankruptcy estate. Alternatively, the trustee may elect to distribute the LLC's property to the bankruptcy estate, and, in turn, liquidate the property himself. In re Albright, 291 B.R. 538 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2003).

       A decision-maker is "independent" within the meaning of this section if
       
       he or she has neither a stake in the litigation nor a relationship with a defendant that would preclude making an unbiased judgment as to whether dismissal of a derivative action is in the limited liability company's (LLC's) best interests. Business, personal, or familial relationships with a defendant raise a question about whether the decision-maker is independent, but they are not dispositive. A court may find, under the facts before it in a given case, that the specific relationship at issue would not interfere with the decision-maker's independence. Young v. Bush,
       <cite class="co_code">

       Trial court should have allowed the plaintiff discovery to establish whether business and family relationships interfered with the LLC members' ability to exercise independent, unbiased judgment regarding maintenance of a derivative action
       
       when the facts set forth in plaintiff's affidavit showed relationships sufficient to create a material question of fact as to the independence of the LLC members who made the best interests determination. Young v. Bush,
       <cite class="co_code">

      <p>
       An inquiry in a derivative proceeding under this section
       
       may be less searching and detailed than the investigations in corporate or limited partnership derivative action cases. The independence of the person making the determination regarding whether the derivative proceeding is in the best interests of the LLC is a matter of degree rather than an absolute. Young v. Bush,
       <cite class="co_code">

       While subsection (1) does not appear to contemplate production of a written report or an investigation

        Designation of "general manager" and not a named individual suffices.
       </b>
       The requirement of this section is met by the designation of the "general manager" of a corporation, residing at its principal place of business, as agent to receive service of process. It is not necessary to give the name of the particular person who happens at the date of the certificate to fill this position, inasmuch as the object of the statute can be best subserved by a certificate of the character filed, for the obvious reason that the death or resignation of the incumbent would not long interfere with the bringing of suits against the corporations.

       <b>
        Similarly, the president and vice-president of a corporation are agents

       of the corporation within the meaning of this section and it is not necessary that an officer serving process should specify in his return that he had served either of these officials in the capacity of agent when it appears that service was upon a specified official of the corporation, which carries with it the information by implication that service was upon an agent thereof. Comet Consol. Mining Co. v. Frost, 15 Colo. 310, 25 P. 506 (1890); Venner v. Denver Union Water Co., 40 Colo. 212, 90 P. 623 (1907).

       Where party did not serve process on a foreign corporation as required by the "long arm" statute,

       But it is not necessary to rely on the "long arm" statute to sustain jurisdiction

       Service of process may be made on agent or secretary of state.

       Determination of "doing business" is matter for court.
       
       The absence of exact measures for the determination of what constitutes doing business in a state for the purpose of becoming amenable to the processes of the courts of the state and the lack of uniformity, taken together with the opportunity of the trial court to observe the witnesses and to weigh their testimony, all lend strength to the wisdom of leaving the matter to the trial court.

      </p>
      <p>
       But each case must be decided ad hoc so to not violate due process.
       
       The question of what constitutes sufficient minimal contact within the state so as to hold that a foreign corporation has subjected itself to in personam jurisdiction without violating due process clause under the fourteenth amendment of federal constitution is resolved on an ad hoc basis, namely, each case rests upon its own facts.

       Purchaser failed to establish seller's status as an agent for a foreign manufacturer
       
       where seller conducted an independent business, purchasing mobile homes outright and selling them in its own business. Hence a motion for substituted service should have been quashed. Geer Co. v. District Court, 172

       Establishing beachhead for business activity and retaining open lines of communication as well as strings of ownership is "doing business"

       And since a foreign manufacturer maintained a local distributor in Colorado,
       
       its sales activity was found to constitute doing business to the extent that service on secretary of state was valid service on the manufacturer, such determination resting largely in the sound discretion of the trial court. Am. Type Founders Co. v. District Court, 154

       </b>
       Since § 7-90-805 is similar to § 7-115-105 as it existed prior to the 2003 repeal and reenactment of article 115 of title 7 and former § 7-115-105 is similar to § 7-9-104 as it existed prior to the 1993 recodification of the "Colorado Business Corporation Act", articles 101 to 117 of title 7, cases construing those provisions and their predecessors have been included in the annotations to this section.

       This section recognizes that a foreign corporation has a corporate existence
       
       in Colorado if it complies with the provisions of this article. Admiral Corp. v. Television Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., 138

       Foreign corporation qualified to do business may use assumed name.
       
       A foreign corporation, having qualified to do business in Colorado, is a corporation existing under the laws of this state within the meaning of §

       providing for filing of assumed names. The right of a foreign corporation to transact business under an assumed name relates only to the remedies available to it in the enforcement of its contracts, and where it is provided as in this section that a foreign corporation shall have the same power as a domestic corporation, and domestic corporations are given the power to conduct their business under an assumed name upon compliance with the statute, foreign corporations may exercise the same power upon compliance with the applicable statute.

        Whether the term "corporation" when used in this code applies to foreign corporations

      </p>

       Since nothing in the language of § 7-5-117 indicates an intent by the general assembly to limit its effect to domestic corporations, it also applies to foreign corporations as contemplated by this section. Jefferson Indus. Bank v. First Golden Bancorp., 762 P.2d 768 (Colo. App. 1988).

        Annotator's note.
       </b>
       Since § 7-102-102 is similar to § 7-2-102 as it existed prior to the 1993 recodification of the "Colorado Business Corporation Act", articles 101 to 117 of title 7, cases construing that provision and its predecessors have been included in the annotations to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The essential prerequisite to the formation of a corporation
       </b>
       is articles of incorporation in form and substance as prescribed by statute. Humphreys v. Mooney, 5 Colo. 282 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But none of the statements which the articles of incorporation are directed to contain are required to be made as condition precedent to the commencement or continuance of business
       </b>
       by the corporation. There is a broad and obvious distinction between such acts as are declared to be necessary steps in the process of incorporation and such as are required of the individuals seeking to become incorporated, but which are not made prerequisite to the assumption of corporate powers. In respect to the former, any material omission will be fatal to the existence of the corporation, and may be taken advantage of collaterally in any form in which the fact of incorporation can be called in question. In respect to the latter, the incorporation is responsible only to the government in a direct proceeding to forfeit the charter. The right to be considered a corporation and the exercise of corporate powers depends upon the fact of the performance of the particular acts named in the statute as essential to its corporate existence. Humphreys v. Mooney, 5 Colo. 282 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        However, without a certificate of renewal or a bona fide attempt thereto, there is no corporation de facto,
       </b>
       where the company does not make any attempt by certificate or otherwise to renew its life. Bonfils v. Hayes, 70 Colo. 336, 201 P. 677 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Prior to issuance of certificate of incorporation no de facto corporate status
       </b>
       regardless of substantial attempt to comply with laws creating corporations. Bowers Bldg. Co. v. Altura Glass Co., 694 P.2d 876 (Colo. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No penalty for omission to comply strictly with this section.
       </b>
       Although this section prescribes the mode of organization and what the articles of incorporation shall contain, it annexes no penalty or liability for the neglect or omission to comply strictly with it. Humphreys v. Mooney, 5 Colo. 282 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But if any one of these statutory requirements is omitted, such omission is a fatal defect
       </b>
       and confers no de jure right to exercise corporate franchises. Bates v. Wilson, 14 Colo. 140, 24 P. 99 (1890).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not require the articles of incorporation to be executed within the limits of the state.
       </b>
       Humphreys v. Mooney, 5 Colo. 282 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Nor does this section require a meeting of the incorporators

        Reasonable restrictions on the sale of corporation stock are neither against public policy nor void,

        Entitlement of preference stock limited upon corporate dissolution.
       </b>
       When the articles of incorporation are silent as to whether preferred stock participates in a company's equity growth, the general rule is that upon corporate dissolution, preferred shareholders are entitled to no more than the liquidation preference stated in the articles, with the holders of common stock entitled to the rest of the corporate assets.

        Purpose of section
       </b>
       is to impose personal liability upon those persons who act as a corporation without having undertaken any bona fide effort to achieve corporate status by complying with the statutory requirements for incorporation. Micciche v. Billings, 727 P.2d 367 (Colo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        If no steps to incorporate have been initiated, and, therefore, no corporation exists, an individual is personally liable for his acts
       </b>
       regardless of his good faith belief in the existence of a corporation. Jean Claude Boisset Wines U.S.A. v. Newton, 830 P.2d 1134 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The statute is intended
       </b>
       to impose personal liability upon those persons who take it upon themselves to hold themselves out and improperly act as a corporation without having undertaken any bona fide effort to achieve corporate status. Jean Claude Boisset Wines U.S.A. v. Newton, 830 P.2d 1134 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The statute is not intended to exempt an individual from liability for his personal acts
       </b>
       where no corporate documents such as the articles of incorporation were ever prepared. Jean Claude Boisset Wines U.S.A. v. Newton, 830 P.2d 1134 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Even if an individual has a good faith belief in the existence of a corporation,
       </b>
       where no steps have been taken to initiate incorporation, an individual is personally liable for such individual's acts purportedly carried out on behalf of the corporation. This section was not intended to exempt an individual from liability for his personal acts where no corporation documents were ever prepared. Jean Claude Boisset Wines U.S.A., Inc. v. Newton, 830 P.2d 1134 (Colo. App. 1992).

         A stock purchase warrant is purely an option to purchase stock

        that does not vest in the prospective purchaser an equitable title to, or any interest or right in, the stock. The value of such an option is speculative - any number of corporate or collateral events may change its value - and the burden of such risk falls on the holder of the warrant. Anderson v. Somatogen, Inc., 940 P.2d 1079 (Colo. App. 1996).

        <b>
         Unless the contract provides otherwise, a warrant holder may not complain,

        for example, when a corporation issues new capital stock, although such issue may lessen or destroy the value of the option. Therefore, whatever rights a stock purchase warrant holder may have to require the obligor corporation to maintain the integrity of the shares are purely contractual. Anderson v.

         Stocks and bonds issued except as provided in this section are in direct violation

       <p>
        Both § 9 of art. XV, Colo. Const. and this section are aimed at preventing the watering of corporate stock;
        
        their purpose is to prevent corporations from issuing stock without receiving full value, and so to prevent the diluting of the holdings of innocent stockholders and the reliance by creditors on false or nonexistent capital resulting from the issuance of "watered" stock. Haselbush v. Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161

        , 421 P.2d 113 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy behind § 7-4-105 (2) and § 9 of art. XV, Colo. Const., is to protect other stockholders of the corporation, creditors, and good faith future stockholders from the dilution of their investment by "watered" stock. Burch v. Exploration Data Consultants, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 155, 518 P.2d 288 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        But this purpose would not be served by holding that these provisions may be used to defeat an action by a corporation seeking to enforce payment
        
        on a promissory note given for the issuance of stock when the transaction has been made in good faith. Haselbush v. Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161
        <cite class="co_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the stock the plaintiff had contracted to purchase became worthless prior to his having made final payment on the note does not entitle plaintiff to recover amounts paid, nor does it furnish a justification for a refusal to pay the remainder due under the terms of the note. Moneys paid and to be paid belong to the creditors of the defendant corporation. Jacobs v. Frontier Tractor &amp; Equip., Inc., 712 P.2d 493 (Colo. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        As this section does not forbid a corporation from taking a note or obligation from a perspective stockholder;
        
        on the contrary, it impliedly recognizes the right to do so, but declares that no such note shall be considered as payment and no certificate shall issue until the note is paid. Haselbush v. Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161

        Outside reverse piercing is appropriate when a claimant demonstrates that a controlling insider and a corporation are alter egos of each other and justice requires recognizing the substance of that relationship over the form to achieve an equitable result.
       </b>
       Outside reverse piercing claims occur when a corporate outsider pressing an action against a corporate insider seeks to disregard the corporate entity and to subject corporate assets to the claim or when an outsider with a claim against a corporate insider seeks to assert that claim against the corporation in an action between the claimant and the corporation. Outside reverse piercing actions involve a corporate outsider seeking to obligate a corporation for the debts of a dominant shareholder or other corporate insider.

      Although it is a question of fact, taking profit from a corporation without paying shareholders may be considered theft.
      
      When majority shareholder used profits for personal uses, the majority shareholder, in essence, declared a distribution. Although a distribution was not formally announced, the trier of fact may find that this is theft from the minority shareholders, who are entitled to their share. Tisch v. Tisch,

       After fixing a record date for a shareholders' meeting, the corporation shall prepare a list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to be given notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting groups and within each voting group by class or series of shares, shall be alphabetical within each class or series, and shall show the address of, and the number of shares of each such class and series that are held by, each shareholder.

       The shareholders' list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning the earlier of ten days before the meeting for which the list was prepared or two business days after notice of the meeting is given and continuing through the meeting, and any adjournment thereof, at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the notice of the meeting in the city in which the meeting will be held. A shareholder or an agent or attorney of the shareholder is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of section 7-116-102 (3) and the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of section 7-116-103, to copy the list during regular business hours and during the period it is available for inspection.

When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and promptly cause the corporation to receive copies of the list and agreement.

An extension is valid for not more than ten years after the date the first shareholder signs the extension agreement, unless such signing occurs within two years before the expiration date of the voting trust as originally fixed or as last extended, in which case the extension is valid for not more than ten years after the expiration date of the voting trust as originally fixed or last extended. The trustee shall cause the corporation to receive copies of the extension agreement. An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it.

        Directors occupy quasi-fiduciary relation to corporation.
       </b>
       In addition to their statutory powers and duties, directors of a corporation are in a broad sense agents of the corporation in that they occupy a quasi-fiduciary relation to the corporation and to its stockholders. Hence they must manage the corporate affairs in good faith within the limits of the law applicable and give the corporate entity the benefit of their best judgment and care. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).

      <p>
       <b>
        Fiduciary duty to minority stockholder was not breached

        Discretionary powers, if honestly exercised, are not subject to control.
       </b>
       Within the limits of their legal authority, directors of a corporation possess by necessity a large amount of discretionary power, and that power, if exercised honestly and with reason, is not subject to control by either the stockholders or the courts. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts will not, at the instance of stockholders or otherwise, interfere with or regulate the conduct of the directors in the reasonable and honest exercise of their judgment and duties. Rywalt v. Writer Corp., 34 Colo. App. 334, 526 P.2d 316 (1974).

       <b>
        Thus courts will accept business judgments unless unlawful.
       </b>
       Since management, backed by majority stock control, has a wide discretion in making business judgments, a court will hospitably accept those business judgments when made with an eye single to the interest of the corporation unless manifestly unlawful. Herald Co. v. Bonfils, 315 F. Supp. 497 (D. Colo. 1970), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Herald v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).

        But when self-interest or improper motives are indicated

        Thus a contract employing director to secure a particular corporate action violates this section.

       A contract of employment which obligates a director to assist one to control the corporate action of the company in securing a particular lease, regardless of his duty as a director to represent and act for all the stockholders alike is against the policy of the law under this section.

       Remedy of stockholders dissatisfied with corporate management is electing new directors.
       
       The officers and directors of a corporation are presumed to represent the will of a majority of the stockholders; thus, when stockholders simply become dissatisfied with corporate management, ordinarily the remedy is to install new management by the election of new directors.

       Since the United States bankruptcy act confers broad powers upon a trustee in bankruptcy, such a trustee takes the place and exercises the office of the directors of a corporation in bankruptcy. Weck v. District Court, 161

        Directors occupy quasi-fiduciary relation to corporation.
       </b>
       In addition to their statutory powers and duties, directors of a corporation are in a broad sense agents of the corporation in that they occupy a quasi-fiduciary relation to the corporation and to its stockholders. Hence they must manage the corporate affairs in good faith within the limits of the law applicable and give the corporate entity the benefit of their best judgment and care. Herald Co. v. Seawell, 472 F.2d 1081 (10th Cir. 1972).

        Discretionary powers, if honestly exercised, are not subject to control.

      The articles of incorporation may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two or three groups, with each group containing one-half or one-third of the total, as near as may be. In that event, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders' meeting after their election, the terms of directors in the second group expire at the second annual shareholders' meeting after their election, and the terms of directors in the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders' meeting after their election. Upon the expiration of the initial staggered terms, directors shall be elected for terms of two years or three years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.

       Stockholder's liability for breach of duty to corporation.
       
       Although it is generally the corporate officers and directors, and not the shareholders, who are charged with the duty of exercising the powers of a corporation and, thus, are the ones who usually incur personal liability for breach of that duty, a stockholder may subject himself to similar liability if, because of his actions as an individual, made possible by reason of his being a stockholder, the corporation acts improperly.

       Stockholder liability does not arise from mere knowledge of and acquiescence in corporate wrongdoing

       <b>
        Purpose of dissenters' rights statutes
       </b>
       is to protect the property rights of dissenting shareholders from actions by majority shareholders that alter the character of their investment. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Statutes, not bylaws of corporation, control valuation of shares.
       </b>
       However, the unique structure of the corporation, as expressed in its bylaws, is a relevant factor. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Interpretation of "fair value".
       </b>
       Relying on case law interpreting "fair value" within the context of dissenters' rights statutes in other states, a determination of fair value is based on all relevant value factors considering the particular circumstances of the corporation involved. Such a determination is not premised upon any precise mathematical formula. Pioneer Bancorporation, Inc. v. Waters, 765 P.2d 597 (Colo. App. 1988); M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        "Fair value" connotes a broader approach to valuation than "fair market value".
       </b>
       In determining fair value, the court must consider all relevant value factors, the most important of which are market value, investment or earnings value, and net asset value. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fair value" does not mean "fair market value";
       
       it means a dissenting shareholder's proportionate interest in the corporation valued as a going concern. Pueblo Bancorporation v. Lindoe, Inc., 63 P.3d 353 (

        A marketability discount may, in appropriate circumstances, be applied in situations in which a closely held corporation's shares are valued under this section,
       </b>
       but such a determination is a factual one that must be made on an ad hoc basis. WCM Indus. v. Trustees of Wilson Trust, 948 P.2d 36 (Colo. App. 1997) (decided under law as it existed prior to the 1994 repeal of § 7-4-124).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Distinction between marketability discount and minority discount.
       </b>
       A minority discount adjusts for lack of control over the business entity on the theory that non-controlling shares of stock are not worth their proportionate share of the firm's value because they lack voting power to control corporate actions. A marketability discount adjusts for a lack of liquidity in one's interest in an entity, on the theory that there is a limited supply of potential buyers for stock in a closely held corporation. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Finding of fair value is a factual determination.
       </b>
       As such, it will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).

        Defendant corporation owed dissenting stockholder the fair value, not the redemption value, for plaintiff's preferred stock.

       Since § 7-113-101 is similar to § 7-4-124 as it existed prior to the 1993 recodification of the "Colorado Business Corporation Act", articles 101 to 117 of title 7, cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations to this section.

       <b>
        Purpose of dissenters' rights statutes
       </b>
       is to protect the property rights of dissenting shareholders from actions by majority shareholders that alter the character of their investment. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Statutes, not bylaws of corporation, control valuation of shares.
       </b>
       However, the unique structure of the corporation, as expressed in its bylaws, is a relevant factor. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Interpretation of "fair value".
       </b>
       Relying on case law interpreting "fair value" within the context of dissenters' rights statutes in other states, a determination of fair value is based on all relevant value factors considering the particular circumstances of the corporation involved. Such a determination is not premised upon any precise mathematical formula. Pioneer Bancorporation, Inc. v. Waters, 765 P.2d 597 (Colo. App. 1988); M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        "Fair value" connotes a broader approach to valuation than "fair market value".
       </b>
       In determining fair value, the court must consider all relevant value factors, the most important of which are market value, investment or earnings value, and net asset value. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fair value" does not mean "fair market value";
       
       it means a dissenting shareholder's proportionate interest in the corporation valued as a going concern. Pueblo Bancorporation v. Lindoe, Inc., 63 P.3d 353 (
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 2003

        A marketability discount may, in appropriate circumstances, be applied in situations in which a closely held corporation's shares are valued under this section,
       </b>
       but such a determination is a factual one that must be made on an ad hoc basis. WCM Indus. v. Trustees of Wilson Trust, 948 P.2d 36 (Colo. App. 1997) (decided under law as it existed prior to the 1994 repeal of § 7-4-124).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Distinction between marketability discount and minority discount.
       </b>
       A minority discount adjusts for lack of control over the business entity on the theory that non-controlling shares of stock are not worth their proportionate share of the firm's value because they lack voting power to control corporate actions. A marketability discount adjusts for a lack of liquidity in one's interest in an entity, on the theory that there is a limited supply of potential buyers for stock in a closely held corporation. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Finding of fair value is a factual determination.
       </b>
       As such, it will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous. M Life Ins. Co. v. Sapers &amp; Wallack Ins. Agency, Inc., 40 P.3d 6 (Colo. App. 2001).
      </p>

       <b>
        Defendant corporation owed dissenting stockholder the fair value, not the redemption value, for plaintiff's preferred stock.
       </b>
       Fair value is akin to fair market value, the value a shareholder would receive in an arms-length transaction, and not necessarily an existent redemptive value if the redemptive value is lower than fair market value. Breniman v. Agricultural Consultants, 829 P.2d 493 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraordinary actions of the corporation in selling off its property permit the dissenting shareholder to invoke this section to obtain fair value payment for his shares. Breniman v. Agricultural Consultants, 829 P.2d 493 (Colo. App. 1992).

The rights of a shareholder who asserts appraisal rights under this subsection (1) for only part of the shares held of record in the shareholder's name are determined as if the shares as to which the shareholder objects and the shareholder's other shares were registered in the names of different shareholders.

       A shareholder that receives notice pursuant to section 7-113-203 and that wishes to exercise appraisal rights must sign and return the form sent by the corporation and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder's certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to in the notice given pursuant to section 7-113-203 (2)(b)(II). In addition, if applicable, the shareholder must certify on the form whether the beneficial owner of the shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to section 7-113-203 (2)(a). If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the shareholder's shares as after-acquired shares under section 7-113-206. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder's certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the signed forms, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.

       Relying on case law interpreting "fair value" within the context of dissenters' rights statutes in other states, a determination of fair value is based on all relevant value factors considering the particular circumstances of the corporation involved. Such a determination is not premised upon any precise mathematical formula. Pioneer Bancorporation, Inc. v. Waters, 765 P.2d 597 (Colo. App. 1988).

       The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under section 7-113-301 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation; except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article 113.

       If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the expenses incurred by any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly situated and that the expenses should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may direct that the expenses be paid out of the amounts awarded to the shareholders who were benefited.

       To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to section 7-113-205, 7-113-206, or 7-113-207, the shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, is entitled to recover from the corporation all expenses of the suit, including reasonable attorney fees.

       Court should not have treated the costs of computer-aided legal research as within the discretionary award of attorney fees;

        Statute of limitations applicable to dissolved foreign corporations.
        
        Since this state has by subsection (1) adopted a two-year statute of limitations applicable to dissolved domestic corporations, it would be both illogical and unconstitutional to apply to a foreign corporation, which has been dissolved pursuant to the laws under which it is governed by its state of incorporation and which has received a certificate of withdrawal from this state, a statute of limitations which would subject it to liability for a period longer than that which this state would apply to a dissolved domestic corporation.

         The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601-9675 (CERCLA), preempts former § 7-8-122,
        </b>
        which provided that a corporation could be sued only within two years of its dissolution. The plain language of CERCLA leads to the conclusion that Congress intended to create liability notwithstanding any other law. Because the Colorado statute actually conflicts with CERCLA, CERCLA preempts the statute. The statute stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes of CERCLA and under the supremacy clause must yield to federal law. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Consolidated Fibers, Inc., 7 F. Supp. 2d 822 (N.D. Tex. 1998) (decided under law in effect before the 1993 recodification of the Colorado Business Corporation Act).

         CERCLA preempts state laws that might limit the liability of dissolved corporations to be sued under CERCLA.
        </b>
        CERCLA's preemption extends to "dead" corporations, which have lawfully dissolved under state law, but does not allow suit to be brought against corporations that are "dead and buried", meaning they have dissolved and distributed all of their assets. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Consolidated Fibers, Inc., 7 F. Supp. 2d 822 (N.D. Tex. 1998) (decided under law in effect before the 1993 recodification of the Colorado Business Corporation Act).

        <b>
         A corporation, although dissolved, is authorized to prosecute an action in its corporate name
        </b>
        by this section. Northwest Dev., Inc. v. Dunn, 29 Colo. App. 364, 483 P.2d 1361 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A dissolved corporation was authorized to enter into a contract for sale of its corporate assets and sue to collect on a promissory note in connection with such sale. Awanderlust Travel, Inc. v. Kochevar, 21 P.3d 876 (Colo. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        And a dissolved corporation may sue out writ of appeal.
        
        A dissolved corporation against which a judgment has been obtained pursuant to this section may sue out a writ of appeal to review the judgment even though that is technically the institution of a new suit. Bankers Trust Co. v. Hall, 116
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 566
        </cite>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And a dissolved corporation that obtains a judgment in an action commenced within the survival period may sue outside the two year survival period to enforce that judgment.
        </b>
        Domino Media, Inc. v. Kranis, 9 F. Supp. 2d 374 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (decided under former § 7-8-122).

        Definition of "oppressive" conduct

       is intended to be broad and flexible. In the context of a close corporation, oppressive conduct by those in control is closely related to breach of the fiduciary duty owed to minority shareholders. Polk v. Hergert Land &amp; Cattle Co., 5 P.3d 402 (Colo. App. 2000).

      Once a receiver is appointed, the right to appeal a district court's final order of dissolution is vested in the receiver;
      
      therefore, the corporation's shareholders cannot appeal the dissolution order without the receiver's involvement. The shareholders must demand that the receiver appeal either the dissolution order or the receiver's appointment and, if refused, seek relief from the trial court. Francis v. Camel Point Ranch,

        And where creditors have repeatedly dealt with a receiver

       in his official capacity and asked or obtained court orders that involved recognition of his appointment by the district court, they thereby acquiesced in such appointment and cannot later complain of it on the ground of mere irregularities.

        But a receiver has no power to carry on a corporation's business.
       </b>
       This section contemplates only the doing of those things which are necessary to the closing up of the affairs of an insolvent corporation; and consequently, that while by his appointment a receiver, becomes eo instanti vested with the legal title and right of possession of all the property of the corporation, both real and personal, for the purpose of subjecting it to the claims of creditors, he has no power, nor can the court clothe him with the power, to continue or carry on the business of the corporation. Standley v. Hendrie &amp; Boltoff Mfg. Co., 27 Colo. 331, 61 P. 600 (1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rather the court appointing a receiver assumes the administration of the affairs of the corporation
       </b>
       for which the receiver was appointed, and it is for that court in its discretion to decide whether it will determine for itself all claims for or against the receiver or will allow them to be litigated elsewhere. However, the receiver is not entitled to the application of this rule where he becomes a party by leave of court. Venner v. Denver Union Water Co., 40 Colo. 212, 90 P. 623 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And the court itself has no greater authority than is conferred in other receivership cases.
       </b>
       While this section confers upon courts power and authority they would not otherwise possess to decree the dissolution of a corporation at the suit of an individual and to that end authorizes the taking charge of its property through a receiver for the purpose of closing up its affairs, it does not confer upon the court any other or greater powers in the administration of such trust than it can exercise in other cases where, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, it may appoint a receiver to administer the affairs of an insolvent private business corporation during pending litigation. Standley v. Hendrie &amp; Boltoff Mfg. Co., 27 Colo. 331, 61 P. 600 (1900).
      </p>

        Consequently the appointment of a receiver for the property of a corporation only deprives a corporation of the exercise of its powers to the extent that
       </b>
       the statute under which such appointment is made or the order of the court making the appointment recites; the corporation is not thereby dissolved but continues as a legal entity and neither are its officers ousted by such action. Hence it follows, that except so far as the control of its affairs is vested in the receiver, it continues to exist for all other purposes, and its officials, except as enjoined by the court appointing the receiver, continue to exercise their functions the same as though no such appointment had been made. Jones v. Bank of Leadville, 10 Colo. 464, 17 P. 272 (1887); Paddack v. Staley, 13 Colo. App. 363, 58 P. 363 (1899); Venner v. Denver Union Water Co., 40 Colo. 212, 90 P. 623 (1907).

       7-114-305. Election to purchase in lieu of dissolution.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol11">
       In a proceeding under section 7-114-301 (2) to dissolve a corporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect, one or more shareholders may elect, to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares. An election pursuant to this section is irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.
      </li>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol12">
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol12a">
         An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety days after the filing of the petition under section 7-114-301 (2) or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten days after the filing, give written notice to all shareholders other than the petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section.
        </li>
        <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol12b">
         Shareholders that wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty days after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase become parties to the proceeding and participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs.
        </li>
        <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol12c">
         After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under section 7-114-302 (2) may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholder's shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit the discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol13">
       If, within sixty days after the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of the petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.
      </li>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol14">
       If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (3) of this section, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceedings held pursuant to section 7-114-302 and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under section 7-114-302 was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.
      </li>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol15">
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol15a">
         Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among the shareholders. In allocating the petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court shall attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes not participate in the purchase.
        </li>
        <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol15b">
         Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed.
        </li>
        <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol15c">
         If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under section 7-114-301 (2)(b) or (2)(d), it may award expenses to the petitioning shareholder.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol16">
       Upon entry of an order under subsection (3) or (5) of this section, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under section 7-114-302 and the petitioning shareholder no longer has any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation other than the right to receive the amounts awarded by the order of the court, which is enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.
      </li>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol17">
       The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section must be made within ten days after the date the order becomes final unless, before that time, the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to sections 7-114-102 and 7-114-103, which articles must then be adopted and filed within fifty days after the filing of the notice. Upon filing of the articles of dissolution, the corporation is dissolved in accordance with sections 7-90-910 to 7-90-914 and the order entered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section is no longer of any force or effect; except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder expenses in accordance with subsection (5)(c) of this section and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.
      </li>
      <li id="t07a114p03s7-114-305ol18">
       Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection (3) or (5) of this section, other than an award of expenses pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, is subject to section 7-106-401.

        In 1958 significant changes were made in this section. Prior thereto it provided for examination by stockholders of "all the books, accounts and papers" of a corporation.

        Officers denying shareholder access to records properly held liable with corporation.
        
        Under this statute enumerating those liable for refusing to allow a shareholder [now shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor] to examine corporate records, and upon evidence showing that corporate officers acted independently, as well as jointly, in denying access to the records, officers who concurred in the denial of the statutory rights of the shareholder [now shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor] could properly be held liable as well as the corporation even though written demand for the examination had been made only upon the corporation. Beebe v. Star-Stop, Inc., 32 Colo. App. 345, 513 P.2d 743 (1973), aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub nom. Beebe v. Pierce, 185

         "Shall" means only that liability, not amount, is mandatory.
        </b>
        Although this section declares that the corporation and/or its officers "shall" be liable for the penalty, the courts which have directly considered the issue have held that use of the word "shall" in this context does not mean that the amount is mandatory, but rather means that the corporation and its officers are thereby mandatorily subjected to liability. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>

        <b>
         Thus court does not have to automatically award full penalty.
        </b>
        Upon making a finding of the existence of the basic conditions required for corporate liability under this section, the court does not have to proceed automatically and mechanically to award the full penalty, for the courts have always been guarded about imposing liability based on failure to comply with a duty imposed by a statute such as this section where the amount of the damage is fixed on a somewhat liquidated measure without regard to injury suffered and, consequently, to construe this section so that the full amount of the prescribed penalty is to be granted on a kind of push button basis would be irrational and inequitable. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A court is at liberty to withhold the award of the penalty if
        </b>
        in view of all the circumstances the award of such damages would not serve the ends of justice. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).

         Applicability of section to foreign corporations.

        Since nothing in the language of this section indicates an intent by the general assembly to limit its effect to domestic corporations, this section also applies to foreign corporations as provided by § 7-9-104. Jefferson Indus. Bank v. First Golden Bancorp., 762 P.2d 768 (Colo. App. 1988).

        Officers denying shareholder access to records properly held liable with corporation.
        
        Under this statute enumerating those liable for refusing to allow a shareholder [now shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor] to examine corporate records, and upon evidence showing that corporate officers acted independently, as well as jointly, in denying access to the records, officers who concurred in the denial of the statutory rights of the shareholder [now shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor] could properly be held liable as well as the corporation even though written demand for the examination had been made only upon the corporation. Beebe v. Star-Stop, Inc., 32 Colo. App. 345, 513 P.2d 743 (1973), aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub nom. Beebe v. Pierce, 185

         "Shall" means only that liability, not amount, is mandatory.
        </b>
        Although this section declares that the corporation and/or its officers "shall" be liable for the penalty, the courts which have directly considered the issue have held that use of the word "shall" in this context does not mean that the amount is mandatory, but rather means that the corporation and its officers are thereby mandatorily subjected to liability. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Thus court does not have to automatically award full penalty.
        </b>
        Upon making a finding of the existence of the basic conditions required for corporate liability under this section, the court does not have to proceed automatically and mechanically to award the full penalty, for the courts have always been guarded about imposing liability based on failure to comply with a duty imposed by a statute such as this section where the amount of the damage is fixed on a somewhat liquidated measure without regard to injury suffered and, consequently, to construe this section so that the full amount of the prescribed penalty is to be granted on a kind of push button basis would be irrational and inequitable. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A court is at liberty to withhold the award of the penalty if
        </b>
        in view of all the circumstances the award of such damages would not serve the ends of justice. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).

         II. SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHT TO INSPECT CORPORATE RECORDS.

        This section was adopted in the year 1929, and for many years prior thereto, there were statutory provisions authorizing the examination of corporate books and records by stockholders. Weck v. District Court, 158

        But inspection is limited to "complete books and records".
        
        In 1958 significant changes were made in this section. Prior thereto it provided for examination by stockholders of "all the books, accounts and papers" of a corporation. The amendment of 1958, however, restricted the right of inspection to "complete books and records of account". Weck v. District Court, 158

         Burden of proving bad faith.
        </b>
        Mere allegations of improper motives or bad faith on the part of one seeking to inspect the corporate books are not enough, and the burden of proof is on those who desire to deny inspection. Dines v. Harris, 88 Colo. 22, 291 P. 1024 (1930).

        Shareholders lists are a part of corporate books and records.

        The federal securities laws and proxy rules, which provide that management must mail the proxy materials of an opposing security holder or provide a shareholders list when making a solicitation, do not preempt the field of access to shareholders lists, and this section is properly available to shareholders to allow their inspection and copying of the shareholders list of equity; they are not required to elect one of the procedures.

        But this section does not nullify statute protecting privileged communications.
        
        The fact that this section provides that a corporation shall keep complete books and records of account, shall keep minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders and board of directors, shall keep a record of its shareholders, and the further fact that a qualified shareholder shall have the right to examine its books and records of account, minutes and record of shareholders, and make extracts therefrom does not operate to nullify the provisions of §

         III. PENALTIES.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         The main purpose of this section
        </b>
        is to emphasize that the right to the list of shareholders is clear and unequivocal. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         However, as an aid in the enforcement of this section a penalty is authorized,
        </b>
        but this is a secondary and not a primary aspect and purpose. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officers denying shareholder access to records properly held liable with corporation.
        
        Under this statute enumerating those liable for refusing to allow a shareholder [now shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor] to examine corporate records, and upon evidence showing that corporate officers acted independently, as well as jointly, in denying access to the records, officers who concurred in the denial of the statutory rights of the shareholder [now shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates therefor] could properly be held liable as well as the corporation even though written demand for the examination had been made only upon the corporation. Beebe v. Star-Stop, Inc., 32 Colo. App. 345, 513 P.2d 743 (1973), aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub nom. Beebe v. Pierce, 185
        <cite class="co_code">

        , 521 P.2d 1263 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         "Shall" means only that liability, not amount, is mandatory.
        </b>
        Although this section declares that the corporation and/or its officers "shall" be liable for the penalty, the courts which have directly considered the issue have held that use of the word "shall" in this context does not mean that the amount is mandatory, but rather means that the corporation and its officers are thereby mandatorily subjected to liability. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Thus court does not have to automatically award full penalty.
        </b>
        Upon making a finding of the existence of the basic conditions required for corporate liability under this section, the court does not have to proceed automatically and mechanically to award the full penalty, for the courts have always been guarded about imposing liability based on failure to comply with a duty imposed by a statute such as this section where the amount of the damage is fixed on a somewhat liquidated measure without regard to injury suffered and, consequently, to construe this section so that the full amount of the prescribed penalty is to be granted on a kind of push button basis would be irrational and inequitable. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A court is at liberty to withhold the award of the penalty if
        </b>
        in view of all the circumstances the award of such damages would not serve the ends of justice. Wood, Walker &amp; Co. v. Evans, 461 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. 1972).

         Applicability of section to foreign corporations.
        </b>
        Since nothing in the language of this section indicates an intent by the general assembly to limit its effect to domestic corporations, this section also applies to foreign corporations as provided by § 7-9-104. Jefferson Indus. Bank v. First Golden Bancorp., 762 P.2d 768 (Colo. App. 1988).

A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the nonprofit corporation's request if the director's duties to the nonprofit corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, the director to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. "Director" includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a deceased director.

"Official capacity" does not include service for any other domestic or foreign corporation, nonprofit corporation, or other person or employee benefit plan.
