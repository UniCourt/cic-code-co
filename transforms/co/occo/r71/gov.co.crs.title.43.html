       Section transfers power to commission from engineer.
       
       By this section the general assembly intended, generally, to transfer the powers and duties of the highway engineer from that officer to the newly established state highway commission. McDonald v. City of Glenwood Springs, 129

       No delegation intended.
       
       If any one or more of the powers and duties set forth in this section were intended to be delegated to the governor or others, it would have been timely to do so when the executive department was reorganized. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Haase, 189

       The general assembly intended that the chief engineer be responsible to the state highway commission in well-defined areas,

       The state highway commission is empowered to direct the chief engineer

       Even in light of the administrative organization act, the commission continues to be empowered to direct the chief engineer as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (e) of subsection (1) of this section. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Haase, 189

       Appointment power to fill expired seats.
       
       Since the terms of the "incumbent commissioners" of the state highway commission expired while the state senate was in session, the interim appointment power of the governor could not be invoked.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the department of transportation controls the use of thousands of acres of rights-of-way in Colorado for highway purposes. The general assembly further finds that, although the primary use of such rights-of-way is for highways, certain rights-of-way could also be used for productive agricultural purposes without reducing the suitability or safety of such rights-of-way for highway purposes and for authorized utility accommodations.
      </li>
      <li id="t43a01p02s43-1-210.01ol12">
       The department of transportation may issue permits to persons who own land adjacent to state highway rights-of-way so that such persons may use such rights-of-way for agricultural purposes. The executive director of the department of transportation, or the director's designee, shall promulgate rules and regulations which describe the terms, conditions, and purposes of such permits. Included in such regulations shall be a definition of adjacent landowner, a description of the types of agricultural uses allowed, the procedure which shall be used to obtain a permit, and any insurance requirements which the executive director finds appropriate. In no event shall a right-of-way permit be entered into which, in the judgment of the department, would not be in the best interests of the state or would be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or in conflict with any applicable federal, state, or local law or for any agricultural purpose which involves irrigation. No right-of-way permit shall authorize the use for agricultural purposes of any median separating traffic lanes on a state highway, or where ownership of the right-of-way is not of public record.

      <li id="t43a01p02s43-1-210.01ol13">
       The department of transportation may charge reasonable and necessary fees for the application and approval of any permits authorized by this section.

       Prior to obtaining a permit from the department of transportation, the permittee shall show proof of insurance in the amount required by the department.

     <p>
      There are hereby created two separate funds, one to be known as the state highway fund and the other to be known as the state highway supplementary fund. All moneys paid into either of said funds shall be available immediately, without further appropriation, for the purposes of such fund as provided by law. Any sums paid into the state treasury, which by law belong to the state highway fund or to the state highway supplementary fund, shall be immediately placed by the state treasurer to the credit of the appropriate fund. Upon request of the commission or of the chief engineer, it is the duty of the state treasurer to report to the commission or to the chief engineer the amount of money on hand in each of said two funds and the amounts derived from each source from which each such fund is accumulated. All accounts and expenditures from each of said two funds shall be certified by the chief engineer and paid by the state treasurer upon warrants drawn by the controller. The controller is authorized as directed to draw warrants payable out of the specified fund upon such vouchers properly certified and audited. Nothing in this part 2 shall operate to alter the manner of the execution and issuance of transportation revenue anticipation notes provided in part 7 of article 4 of this title.

If the department finds that the entity has used the method of economic analysis as prescribed and the entity has determined that the defined area would suffer substantial economic hardship by such removal and that the declaration complies with all applicable rules and regulations, the department shall forward such declaration, resolution, or document and economic analysis with its recommendations to the United States secretary of transportation pursuant to 23 U.S.C. sec. 131(o).

        Exempting from removal certain tourist-related signs is constitutionally permissible.

       Because the tourist-related sign exemption is tailored narrowly to further an important interest of the state, that exception does not unconstitutionally discriminate in favor of tourist-related advertising devices. Pigg v. State Dept. of Hwys., 746 P.2d 961 (Colo. 1987).

        Restriction of signs is under police power of city.

       Restricting outdoor advertising as nonconforming uses was an integral part of a valid overall zoning plan to accomplish its legitimate purposes. Therefore, the restriction is under the police power of the city instead of the eminent domain power. Art Neon Co. v. City &amp; County of Denver, 488 F.2d 118 (10th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 932, 94 S. Ct. 2644, 41 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1974) (decided under prior law).

      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that local government involvement in transportation planning is critical to the overall statewide transportation planning process. The general assembly recognizes that regional planning commissions and transportation planning regions are the proper forum for transportation planning and that the county hearing process is the proper forum for local government input into the five-year program of projects. However, the general assembly also recognizes that state involvement in transportation planning, through the department of transportation, is equally critical to overall statewide planning, and the general assembly recognizes the department of transportation as the proper body, in cooperation with regional planning commissions and local government officials, for developing and maintaining the state transportation planning process and the state transportation plan.

       With respect to express preemption argument, contrary to CDOT's argument, this section does not express an unequivocal intent to preempt all local regulation of transportation issues. The statute does not foreclose all regulation; it remains open to the possibility that the statewide planning process will leave some questions unresolved and that local governments may decide those matters by regulation. With respect to implied preemption, the court cannot conclude that CDOT was meant to occupy the entire field of transportation planning when the legislature has indicated that local governments may regulate the site selection of airports, transit terminals, and highways.

       The transportation commission, using existing or easily obtainable data, shall conduct or direct the department of transportation to conduct a study of the state highway system for the purpose of determining which highways or portions of highways that are part of the state highway system are commuter highways. The commission shall report the results of the study to the transportation and energy committee of the house of representatives and the transportation committee of the senate, or any successor committees, no later than February 1, 2011. The commission may include in the report recommendations as to whether all or some of the identified commuter highways should be removed from the state highway system and thereafter maintained and supervised by counties and municipalities. If the commission recommends the removal of any commuter highways from the state highway system, it shall first have consulted with the affected metropolitan planning organizations in the conduct of the study, received the input of one local government elected official appointed by each of the five metropolitan planning organizations in the state for the purpose of providing such input, and presented the recommendations to the boards of the affected metropolitan planning organizations for review and comment and shall also make recommendations regarding modification of the formulas used to allocate moneys in the highway users tax fund between the state, counties, and municipalities set forth in part 2 of article 4 of this title to provide the level of funding necessary to avoid any unfunded mandates created by changes in the allocation of highway maintenance and supervision responsibilities between the state, counties, and municipalities that would result from the removal. A report made pursuant to this section that includes recommendations as to whether commuter highways should be removed from the state highway system shall include a statement regarding the extent to which the elected officials appointed by the metropolitan planning organizations in the state agree with the commission's recommendations.

       The board of county commissioners on its own initiative may lay out, widen, alter, or change any county road, and the board of county commissioners shall cause the county road supervisor of the respective county to survey the proposed road and make a written report to the board of county commissioners of the county, describing the proposed road to be laid out, opened, or changed, as the case may be, and the portions of land of each landowner to be taken for that purpose, said report to be accompanied by a map showing the present and proposed boundaries of the portion of the county road to be established, opened, or changed, together with an estimate of the damages and benefits accruing to each landowner whose land may be affected thereby. If, upon receipt of such report, the board of county commissioners decides that public interest or convenience will be subserved by the proposed change, said board shall certify such proposal to the transportation commission and cause a plat to be filed in the office of the county clerk and recorder in a book kept for that purpose.

Any person owning land or having interest in land over which any proposed county road extends, who is of the opinion that such tender is inadequate, may personally, or by agent or attorney, on or before ten days from the date of such tender, file a written request addressed to the board of county commissioners of said county for a jury to ascertain the compensation which he may be entitled to by reason of damages sustained therefrom. Thereupon, the board of county commissioners shall proceed in the acquisition of such premises under articles 1 to 7 of title 38, C.R.S. The board of county commissioners also has the power and is authorized to proceed in the acquisition of lands of private persons for county roads, under and according to articles 1 to 7 of title 38, C.R.S., in the first instance without tender or other proceedings under this part 1.

      When a portion of the county primary system is relocated and because of such relocation a portion of the route as it existed before such relocation is, in the opinion of the board of county commissioners, no longer necessary as part of the county road system, such portion shall be considered as abandoned, and title to it shall revert to the owner of the land through which such abandoned portion may lie subject to the provisions of part 3 of this article.

If it appears to the board that any landowner suffers damages because of the abandonment of any portion of a county primary road, such damages shall be determined, tendered, and paid in the same manner as other damages referred to in this part 1.

       Municipal regulations relating to traffic and parking on highway-streets subject to approval by highway department.
       
       This section declares that cities, cities and counties, and incorporated towns shall regulate and enforce traffic and parking restrictions on all highway-streets within the municipal boundaries, but provides that all regulations shall be subject to approval of the department of highways before becoming effective. This section also purports to divide authority over streets which are part of the state highway system. It defines in detail the obligations of cities, cities and counties, and incorporated towns with respect to streets which are a part of the state highway system. City &amp; County of Denver v. Pike, 140
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 17
       </cite>
       , 342 P.2d 688 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where state has recognized right to regulate, no prior approval required.
       
       Where the right of a city to regulate speed on a freeway bisecting a city has been recognized by the state, allowing the city to post the highway and enforce its ordinances, it is not necessary for the city to obtain prior approval of its regulations before they could become effective. City &amp; County of Denver v. Pike, 140
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 17

       , 342 P.2d 688 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes resort to agreement concerning the acquisition of property;
       
       however, it is only an optional method and is permissible as a substitute for proceedings in condemnation. Town of Greenwood Vill. v. District Court, 138
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 283
       </cite>

      </p>
      <p>
       Considering paragraphs (j) and (k) of subsection (1) together, paragraph (j) is permissive only
       
       and does not make consent of a town a prerequisite to condemnation of private property within its corporate limits, or to condemnation of public property already in use for street purposes, the fee title to which lies in a town. Town of Greenwood Vill. v. District Court, 138
       <cite class="co_code">

       The department of highways can lawfully condemn public or private property within a municipality
       
       for the purpose of continuing state highways into or through cities or towns. The principle is identical as far as acquisition of park lands by the state is concerned. Welch v. City &amp; County of Denver, 141
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 587
       </cite>

      </p>
      <p>
       State not compelled to condemn where city and state have agreement.
       
       Where agreement was reached between the state and the city where the city granted the state the right to construct a highway on park land, the state was not compelled to institute condemnation proceedings. By enacting the ordinances authorizing the use of park lands for highway purposes, all was accomplished by agreement that would otherwise have had to be accomplished by condemnation proceedings.

        Mere use without intent to dedicate is insufficient.
        
        Mere proof of the use of land of this character, for a long period of time, by individuals, or even by the public generally, for the purpose of travel, without objection from the owner and without evidence from which an intent to dedicate might be inferred, is not sufficient to give a route so taken the character of a public highway.

         Dedication may be implied.
        </b>
        Where a road runs through private lands, its dedication as a public highway may be implied: When it is satisfactorily proved that it was the owner's intention to set apart the land occupied as a road to the use of the public as a highway, and that there has been an acceptance by the public of the land for such use. The line of the road must be certain and definite; a general privilege or license by the owner to cross his lands, without reference to any special route, will not suffice; user of the road by the public for a considerable length of time without objection by the owner of the land may increase the weight of the evidence, if any there be, arising from acts or declarations of the owner indicating his intent to dedicate; but mere user, without such acts or declarations, unless for a period of time corresponding to the statutory limitation of real actions, cannot be held sufficient to vest the easement in the public, as by prescription.

        Land must be used by public with owner's knowledge, adversely and continuously.
        
        A highway may exist by prescription, but to establish such a highway the land in question must have been used by the public with the actual or implied knowledge of the landowner, adversely under claim or color of right -- not merely by the owner's permission -- and continuously and uninterruptedly for the period required to bar an action for the recovery of the possession of land or otherwise prescribed by statute.

        User must be confined to a definite and specific line.
        
        The public cannot acquire a prescriptive right to pass over a tract of land generally; in order to create a highway by prescription, the user must be confined to a definite and specific line or way. This is especially true where the locus in quo consists of wild or unenclosed lands. However, it is not indispensable that there shall be no deviation from a direct line of travel or that all vehicles that traverse the road shall follow exactly the same route or traverse the road in exactly the same rut. Slight variations in the line of travel are not fatal; it is sufficient that the travel has been confined to substantially the same line. Starr v. People, 17

        Presumption of adverse use after prescribed period of time.
        
        When testing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of title by prescription the party asserting the same is aided by a presumption that the character of the use is adverse where such use is shown to have been made for a prescribed period of time. The rule is no different with respect to presumptive rights gained by the public under this section. Shively v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 159

         On the claim of right issue, the claimant must provide evidence that a reasonably diligent landowner would have had notice of the public's claim of right to the road.
        </b>
        The evidence must include some overt act on the part of the public entity responsible for roads in the jurisdiction that it considers the road a public road. This notification commences the prescriptive period; without it, the prescriptive period never begins. Here, the uncontested facts of record on summary judgment failed to demonstrate county's claim of right for a public road on the subject property that commenced the running of the 20-year prescriptive period; thus, the trial court erred in ruling that the prescriptive period had run against these property owners. McIntyre v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 86 P.3d 402 (Colo. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        An overt act sufficient to provide notice of the public claim of right could include any number of actions. Plowing the road for snow, including a road on a public road system map, using the road for mail delivery or school buses, expending public funds for the maintenance or improvement of the road, posting signage indicating a public road, or installing drainage systems for the road could each be an act putting the landowner on notice of the public's claim of right to the road. As with other requirements for establishing a public road by prescription, the public entity has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to demonstrate that it considered the way across the private property a public road. McIntyre v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 86 P.3d 402 (Colo. 2004).

        Presumption of adverse use inapplicable where land vacant, unenclosed, and unoccupied.
        
        Where the land involved is vacant, unenclosed, and unoccupied, the presumption that the use is adverse where the use is shown to have been made for a prescribed period of time is not applicable. Simon v. Pettit, 651 P.2d 418 (Colo. App. 1982), aff'd on other grounds, 687 P.2d 1299 (

       <p>
        <b>
         To be adverse, the use should be part of a pattern of general public use and not sporadic in nature;
        </b>
        however, in prescriptive easement cases, intermittent use on a long-term basis has satisfied requirement of adverse use. Here, there is evidence to support trial court's conclusion that relevant land was not vacant, unenclosed, and unoccupied, and so the trial court properly applied the presumption of adverse use. There was also evidence in the record supporting trial court's conclusion that the public used the subject road during the prescriptive period from the 1870s through the 1920s as part of a pattern of general public use and not merely sporadic or intermittent use. Accordingly, evidence supported trial court's findings and conclusions that public's use of subject road was adverse. Bockstiegel v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 97 P.3d 324 (Colo. App. 2004).

        Obstruction as prevention of acquisition of public highway by prescription.

       <p>
        Where a gate which blocked a road, which was sought to be declared a public road by adverse use, was close to defendants' property and there are no intervening properties between it and plaintiffs' land asserting the prescriptive right, the existence of the gate was properly considered as evidence that the road was blocked and that the prescriptive time was interrupted.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section directly authorizes boards of county commissioners to make bids and enter into certain contracts
       
       with the state highway department or any agency of the federal or state government "for the construction, maintenance, and repair of state or federal highways or bridges within their respective counties and to undertake and perform whatever work is necessary in connection therewith". This manifestly makes the board of county commissioners a state agency in disbursing the "county emergency relief fund". The general assembly has imposed new duties -- other than for county purposes proper -- upon certain county officers. This is corroborated by the provision that "all labor employed in such contracts shall be bona fide residents of the state of Colorado". Walker v. Bedford, 93

       43-2-209. Contract for work on highways - advertise for bids.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If any board of county commissioners desires to let out any work on the county highways by contract, it may advertise in a legal newspaper in the county or post a notice in the county courthouse, for a period of not less than ten days before the contract is let, for sealed proposals for performing the work. When a contract for work on highways involves expenditures equal to or greater than the amount at which a contract requires a contractor's bond under section 38-26-105, C.R.S., the board of county commissioners shall advertise in a newspaper as provided in this section unless such advertisement, in the judgment of the board, would be detrimental to the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. The advertisement must describe the work to be done and its location and must refer all persons to the person holding the plans and specifications therefor. and such contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, the board reserving the right to reject any bids proffered. The cost of any county highway work mentioned in sections 43-2-208 to 43-2-210 may be paid out of the county road and bridge fund or emergency road fund, as the board may determine.

       43-3-205. Trust indentures.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the discretion of the department of transportation, such bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the department of transportation and a corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indentures may pledge or assign tolls and revenue to be received from the operation of the turnpike project but shall not convey or mortgage the turnpike or any part thereof. The resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, covenants setting forth the duties of the department of transportation in relation to the acquisition of properties and the construction, maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the turnpike project and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the department of transportation may deem reasonable for the security of bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the turnpike project.

        <li id="t43a04p05s43-4-502ol11a">
         The necessity for this part 5 results from the large population and population growth within metropolitan regions in the state, from the significant and growing demand for construction of beltways within such metropolitan regions to facilitate traffic movement in such metropolitan regions and the inadequacy of current transportation facilities to meet that demand, from the division of such metropolitan regions into a variety of incorporated and unincorporated areas, from the need to coordinate planning and construction of beltways or other transportation improvements to serve regional needs, and from the limited availability of state and federal funds for such purposes;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p05s43-4-502ol11b">
         The creation of public highway authorities implements section 18 (2) of article XIV of the state constitution and is essential to the continued economic growth of the metropolitan regions of this state, is in the public interest, and will promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state by securing for them more adequate transportation;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p05s43-4-502ol11c">
         It is the intention of the general assembly that public highway authorities be formed to finance, construct, operate, or maintain all or a portion of a beltway or other transportation improvements in a metropolitan region which, because of the cost or the location thereof in the jurisdiction of more than one municipality or county, cannot feasibly be financed, constructed, operated, or maintained by a municipality or county acting alone and that it is not the intention of the general assembly that public highway authorities be formed to assume, directly or indirectly, the traditional role of counties or municipalities to finance, construct, operate, or maintain local arterial or collector streets;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p05s43-4-502ol11d">
         It is the intention of the general assembly that a beltway developed pursuant to this part 5 shall ultimately be supported by tolls and that, therefore, it is the intention of the general assembly that revenue-raising powers other than tolls, granted by this part 5 to authorities, counties, and municipalities, shall be terminated at such time as the boards of the authorities determine that projected tolls will be sufficient to meet the authorities' obligations to their bondholders and to operate and maintain such beltways or other transportation improvements.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t43a04p05s43-4-502ol12">
       It is further the intent of the general assembly that no provision of this part 5 shall affect the "Public School Finance Act of 1973", article 50 of title 22, C.R.S., the "Public School Finance Act of 1988", article 53 of title 22, C.R.S., the "Public School Finance Act of 1994", article 54 of title 22, C.R.S., or any additional school financing mechanisms adopted by the general assembly.
      </li>
      <li id="t43a04p05s43-4-502ol13">
       The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that it is the intention of the general assembly that public highway authorities be permitted to qualify as enterprises under section 20 of article X of the state constitution. Since the Colorado supreme court in Nicholl v. E-470 Public Highway Authority, 896 P.2d 859 (
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1995
       </cite>
       ), determined that the power to impose taxes is inconsistent with the establishment of a public highway authority as an "enterprise" under section 20 of article X of the state constitution, those powers of taxation are hereby eliminated by S.B. 96-173, as enacted at the second regular session of the sixtieth general assembly.

       Accordingly, landowners were entitled to all attorney fees incurred in connection with condemnation proceedings when their compensation award exceeded 130% of the last written offer made before a highway authority filed its initial petition for condemnation even though the award did not similarly exceed a subsequent written offer made in connection with the filing of an amended petition.

       Trial court properly considered whether attorney fees and costs incurred in second appeal were reasonably necessary to achieve result required by subsection (1)(h)(II)(B), namely, an award of just compensation exceeding 130% of the amount last offered by highway authority. Here, after remand from first appeal, it was clear that landowners had achieved result contemplated by subsection (1)(h)(II)(B). Landowners then raised for first time constitutionality of statutory provision reducing compensation award by amount of special benefits added to landowner's remaining property from condemnation, seeking monetary damages which the supreme court subsequently determined were not due to landowners. There was nothing unreasonable, arbitrary, or unfair about trial court's conclusion that landowner's unsuccessful second appeal was not reasonably necessary to the ultimate result they achieved in the case. Landowners not entitled to assume highway authority would have to pay their appellate fees and costs no matter how second appeal came out. E-470 Pub. Hwy. Auth. v. Revenig, 140 P.3d 227 (Colo.

A copy of the value capture plan shall be submitted to the division, the department of revenue, and the governing body of each governmental unit which has the power to levy or impose a property tax or sales tax within the boundaries of the proposed value capture area. Not less than twenty days prior to the hearing on the value capture plan, notice of the time and place of the hearing on the value capture plan shall be published at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed value capture area and shall be mailed to the division and the governmental units which receive the value capture plan.

       Municipal annexation does not remove property from a regional transportation authority.
       
       The subsection (2) prohibition on the nonconsensual inclusion in a regional transportation authority of territory outside of the boundaries of the members of the combination that are creating the authority applies only when the authority is being created. Subsequent annexation by a municipality that is not a member of the combination of unincorporated territory already within the boundaries of an authority therefore does not remove the territory from the authority and the authority may continue to levy its sales tax on taxable transactions conducted on the property.

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol11a">
         The rapid growth of the economy of this state has prompted new and ever-increasing uses of public highways, roads, and other transportation infrastructure, and the existing transportation infrastructure of this state cannot accommodate such greatly increased uses;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol11b">
         One of the major concerns of the citizens of this state is the ability of the state and local governments to address the long-term transportation infrastructure needs of this state that are critical to the continued growth of the state's economy and the maintenance of citizens' quality of life;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol11c">
         In an attempt to address this concern, the state has significantly increased the amount of state revenues available in recent years to fund critical, priority transportation infrastructure needs, but current transportation funding mechanisms do not provide adequate revenues to keep pace with the increasing demands on transportation infrastructure statewide;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol11d">
         By utilizing revenue anticipation notes for the financing of transportation projects that may be financed, in whole or in part, with federal transportation funds, a significant amount of up-front revenues can be generated for such federal aid transportation projects which will enable the state to design and construct such transportation projects without using revenues available for other important transportation projects;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol11e">
         Utilizing revenue anticipation notes to finance federal aid transportation projects also results in significant cost savings to the state, since such transportation projects can be completed at present-day costs and at an accelerated pace, but the state needs to be able to act quickly to issue revenue anticipation notes in order to realize these cost savings; and
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol11f">
         It is reasonable and necessary to utilize revenue anticipation notes for the financing of federal aid transportation projects.

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol12a">
         The current and long-standing process of funding the transportation infrastructure needs of the state, which involves the continuous appropriation of certain state revenues to the department of transportation by the general assembly and the annual allocation of state and federal funds to specific projects and purposes by the transportation commission, is intended to ensure that such funding decisions are based on annual determinations of revenue availability and transportation infrastructure needs statewide;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol12b">
         Making the payment of revenue anticipation notes issued in accordance with this part 7 subject to annual allocation by the transportation commission is equivalent to making such payments subject to annual legislative appropriation, since the annual allocation process requires the transportation commission to make the same annual budgeting decisions that the general assembly makes through the appropriation process;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p07s43-4-701ol12c">
         Revenue anticipation notes issued in accordance with the provisions of this part 7 that evidence the right to receive payments in subsequent fiscal years contingent upon funds for such payments being allocated on an annual basis in the sole discretion of the transportation commission do not constitute "a debt by loan in any form" under section 3 of article XI of the state constitution based upon the Colorado supreme court's decision in Submission of Interrogatories on House Bill 99-1325, Case No. 99SA108 (April 23, 1999), since the notes are not a legally enforceable obligation against the state in future years and the annual allocation of such funds for the payment of such notes is in the sole discretion of the transportation commission; and

         In accordance with the Colorado supreme court decision in Submission of Interrogatories on House Bill 99-1325, Case No. 99SA108 (April 23, 1999), the proceeds of any transportation revenue anticipation notes issued in accordance with this part 7 are not included in state fiscal year spending for purposes of section 20 of article X of the state constitution and article 77 of title 24, C.R.S.

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol11a">
         The continued prosperity of the state and its citizens requires a safe, well-maintained, integrated, multimodal, and sustainable surface transportation system that is accessible in all parts of the state and that allows efficient movement of people, goods, and information;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol11b">
         The primary funding sources dedicated for surface transportation, state and federal motor fuel taxes, are flat rate per gallon taxes that have lost and will continue to lose much of their purchasing power because they are not indexed to inflation, have not been increased in nearly two decades, and generate less revenue per vehicle mile traveled as motor vehicles become more fuel efficient;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol11c">
         Due to the decline in the purchasing power of the revenues generated by the state and federal motor fuel taxes, the state and local governments have been unable to maintain, repair, reconstruct, operate, and improve surface transportation infrastructure in a strategic, timely, and efficient manner, which has already caused many bridges in the state to become structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and worsened the condition of road surfaces, delayed capacity expansion projects, and increased traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions; and
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol11d">
         Because this decline in purchasing power is ongoing and becomes more severe with each passing year, the state and local governments will continue to be unable to maintain, repair, reconstruct, operate, and improve surface transportation infrastructure in a strategic, timely, and efficient manner, and the safety, efficiency, and environmental impact of the state's surface transportation system will worsen more quickly in the future if sufficient and sustainable funding sources for surface transportation cannot be found.

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol12a">
         The national and state economic recession and attendant rise in unemployment represent additional short- to medium-term challenges for the state and all Coloradans;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol12b">
         There is an urgent present need to repair and replace structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges and improve highway safety in the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol12c">
         Increasing funding for designated bridge projects and road safety projects in the short- and medium-term through the imposition of bridge and road safety surcharges and other new fees at rates reasonably calculated based on the benefits received by the persons paying the fees will not only provide funding to complete the projects but will also accelerate the state's economic recovery by increasing bridge and road construction, repair, reconstruction, and maintenance activity, as well as related economic activity, and by employing significant numbers of Coloradans;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol12d">
         The creation of a statewide bridge enterprise authorized to complete designated bridge projects, to impose a bridge safety surcharge and issue revenue bonds, and, if required approvals are obtained, to contract with the state to receive one or more loans of moneys received by the state under the terms of one or more lease-purchase agreements authorized by this part 8 and to use the revenues generated by the bridge safety surcharge to repay any such loan or loans, will improve the safety and efficiency of the state transportation system by allowing the state to accelerate the repair, reconstruction, and replacement of structurally deficient, functionally obsolete, and rated as poor bridges;
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol12e">
         The creation of a high-performance transportation enterprise with the authority and mission to seek out opportunities for innovative and efficient means of financing other important surface transportation infrastructure projects will ensure that such projects are also properly prioritized and accelerated; and
        </li>
        <li id="t43a04p08s43-4-802ol12f">
         Granting the bridge enterprise and the transportation enterprise both responsibility for the completion, respectively, of designated bridge projects and other important surface transportation projects and the flexibility to execute their respective missions in a variety of innovative ways will ensure that available resources for such projects are efficiently and effectively leveraged so that both the projects and the state's economic recovery can be completed as quickly as possible.

       The statewide bridge enterprise is an enterprise exempt from the requirements of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, art. X, ยง 20, of the state constitution (TABOR)
       
       because it is a government-owned business, the bridge safety surcharge that it imposes is a fee, not a tax, and the federal funds and designated bridges that it receives are not grants from the state or any local government. Consequently, it did not violate TABOR when it imposed a bridge safety surcharge and issued revenue bonds without prior voter approval. TABOR Found. v. Colo. Bridge Enter.,

       The statewide bridge enterprise may issue revenue bonds without obtaining prior voter approval.
       
       The enterprise is an enterprise exempt from the requirements of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, art. X, ยง 20, of the state constitution (TABOR) because it is a government-owned business, the bridge safety surcharge that it imposes is a fee, not a tax, and the federal funds and designated bridges that it receives are not grants from the state or any local government. Consequently, it did not violate TABOR when it imposed a bridge safety surcharge and issued revenue bonds without prior voter approval. TABOR Found. v. Colo. Bridge Enter.,

       The southwest chief rail line economic development, rural tourism, and infrastructure repair and maintenance fund is created in the state treasury. The fund consists of any moneys, including but not limited to any gifts, grants, or donations, received by the state from the federal government, local governments, public-private partnerships, or any other person, or as a result of any voter-approved ballot measure, that are dedicated for the purposes of ensuring that the Amtrak southwest chief rail line continues to pass through Colorado and that an additional stop in Pueblo is added to the line, and any other moneys that the general assembly may appropriate or transfer to the fund. Interest and income earned on the deposit and investment of moneys in the fund and all unencumbered and unexpended moneys in the fund at the end of any fiscal year remain in the fund. Subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly, the commission may expend moneys from the fund for its administrative, staffing, and any other operating expenses and for the costs of any necessary studies. Subject to annual appropriation, the commission may also expend moneys from the fund for rail replacement or other improvements to the portion of the BNSF railway line used to provide existing Amtrak southwest chief rail line service in Colorado and to pay costs associated with the expansion of southwest chief rail line service to include a stop in Pueblo.

       Section does not prohibit court instruction in negligence action.
       
       The fact that this section makes it a criminal act to place an obstruction on the highway does not prohibit a court in a negligence action from instructing on the common-law doctrine that one who moves an obstruction into someone else's path and thus creates a hazard to another must either remove the obstruction or warn others of the hazard if he has a reasonable time and opportunity to do so.

        Absent negligence, seepage from ditch injuring highway not actionable.

       Considering that to violate any of the provisions requires active causation, that the construction of ditches is a lawful enterprise, especially authorized by statute, that under other statutes the owner of a ditch is not liable for injuries to land by seepage, it was held that injury to a public highway by seepage from a ditch gives no action, unless negligence is shown.
