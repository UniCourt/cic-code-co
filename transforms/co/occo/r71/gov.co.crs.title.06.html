     The Colorado general assembly omitted the definition of "advertise",
    </b>
    recognizing that definitions in statutes should be limited to the fewest number of words and phrases possible, and that there is no need for a redefinition of terms. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).

       <b>
     So meaning of "advertise" determined by reference to "advertisement".
    </b>
    Statutes must be construed as a whole, and the several parts of a statute reflect light upon each other, so in this section the meaning of "advertise" can and must be determined by reference to the definition of "advertisement". People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     For the word "advertise" is but the verbal form of the noun "advertisement",
    </b>
    so what the statutory definition of the noun encompasses must by common sense apply to the verbal form of the noun when used in the same statute. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).

       <b>
        Advertisement or sale of real property covered.
       </b>
       Read together, the definitions in subsections (1), (8) and (10) indicate an intent by the general assembly to extend the coverage of the Consumer Protection Act to transactions involving the advertisement or sale of real property. People ex rel. MacFarlane v. Alpert Corp., 660 P.2d 1295 (Colo. App. 1982).

      <p>
       <b>
     Similarly, although the Colorado Consumer Protection Act does not specifically define "disparagement"
    </b>
    anywhere, the word has such a common meaning that to define it would be an exercise in redundancy, since legal literature contains many instances of the use of the word "disparagement" when dealing with forbidden trade practices. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).

        "Pyramid promotional scheme".
       </b>
       A pyramid sales scheme is no less a security because of the sale of distributorships where what, in essence, was being offered was an opportunity to contribute money and to share in the profits of an enterprise managed and owned by Master Industries. Sauer v. Hays, 36 Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although pyramid promotional schemes as defined in subsection (9) are not specifically included within the securities act, that statutory prohibition is indicative of the attitude of the general assembly to schemes of that nature. Sauer v. Hays, 36 Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Promoters of pyramid promotional plans must make full, complete, and fair disclosure, through the registration statement, of the perils involved before their prospects invest their money. Sauer v. Hays, 36 Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       A pyramid promotional scheme involved an "investment contract", a "common enterprise" whereby the "fortunes of the investors" were "inextricably tied" and dependent upon the efforts and success of the corporation in obtaining and recruiting new prospects for its seminars and in consummating sales, and constituted the sale of securities in violation of Colorado's securities act. Sauer v. Hays, 36 Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343 (1975).

     <p>
      The attorney general and the district attorneys of the several judicial districts of this state are concurrently responsible for the enforcement of this article 1. Until the Colorado supreme court adopts a venue provision relating to this article 1, actions instituted pursuant to this article 1 may be brought in the county where an alleged deceptive trade practice occurred or where any portion of a transaction involving an alleged deceptive trade practice occurred, or in the county where the principal place of business of any defendant is located, or in the county in which any defendant resides. An action under this article 1 brought by the attorney general or a district attorney does not require proof that a deceptive trade practice has a significant public impact.

The court may make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by such person of any such deceptive trade practice or which may be necessary to completely compensate or restore to the original position of any person injured by means of any such practice or to prevent any unjust enrichment by any person through the use or employment of any deceptive trade practice.

       Where the attorney general or a district attorney has authority to institute a civil action or other proceeding pursuant to the provisions of this article, the attorney general or district attorney may accept, in lieu thereof or as a part thereof, an assurance of discontinuance of any deceptive trade practice listed in section  6-1-105 or part 7 of this article. Such assurance may include a stipulation for the voluntary payment by the alleged violator of the costs of investigation and any action or proceeding by the attorney general or a district attorney and any amount necessary to restore to any person any money or property that may have been acquired by such alleged violator by means of any such deceptive trade practice. Any such assurance of discontinuance accepted by the attorney general or a district attorney and any such stipulation filed with the court as a part of any such action or proceeding shall be a matter of public record unless the attorney general or the district attorney determines, at his or her discretion, that it will be confidential to the parties to the action or proceeding and to the court and its employees. Upon the filing of a civil action by the attorney general or a district attorney alleging that a confidential assurance of discontinuance or stipulation accepted pursuant to this subsection (2) has been violated, said assurance of discontinuance or stipulation shall thereupon be deemed a public record and open to inspection by any person. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence of a violation of any such assurance or stipulation shall constitute prima facie evidence of a deceptive trade practice for the purposes of any civil action or proceeding brought thereafter by the attorney general or a district attorney, whether a new action or a subsequent motion or petition in any pending action or proceeding.

     Procedural due process protections require an evidentiary hearing before a court enters a significant money judgment for restitution under the CCPA.

    The CCPA authorizes a court to compensate or restore to the original position any person injured by a deceptive trade practice or to prevent any unjust enrichment of any person through the use of a deceptive trade practice, but due process requires advance notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to state action resulting in deprivation of a significant property interest.

     Where a violation occurs, this section permits
    </b>
    the attorney general to apply for either a temporary restraining order or injunction or to seek a voluntary "assurance of discontinuance" from a party alleged to have engaged in deceptive trade practices. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     The attorney general should be granted the opportunity to choose,
    </b>
    depending upon the circumstances of the case, between initiating an injunctive proceeding in court or accepting an assurance of discontinuance directly from the alleged violator. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Where the attorney general has authority to institute a civil action, he may accept an assurance of discontinuance
    </b>
    of the deceptive trade practice in lieu thereof, giving him the option, whenever he has cause to believe that a person has engaged in a deceptive trade practice, of either filing an action in court against the alleged violator or accepting his assurance that he will discontinue the illegal practice.

      <p>
       <b>
     When the attorney general seeks an injunction
    </b>
    he is not demanding that the defendant be punished with a penal sanction, but rather that the defendant be restrained from acting unlawfully in the future, so it is unnecessary that this section provide absolutely precise warning before its equitable sanctions are applied. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).

      <p>
       <b>
     Moreover, the failure to set forth criteria to assist the attorney general in choosing between the two methods
    </b>
    of enforcement set out in this section is not a denial of equal protection in violation of the Colorado Constitution, for, while a legislative body may not delegate the power to make or define a law, it may delegate the power, authority, and discretion as to the execution and enforcement of the law. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).

    his right to decide between accepting an assurance of discontinuance or initiating a court action will not be overturned on equal protection grounds. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of Am., Inc., 177<cite class="co_code">Colo. 97</cite>, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).

     Benefit of the bargain approach to restitution

       <b>
     The sole fact that a law firm's clients included quasi-public entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not establish a significant impact to the public.
    </b>
    The deceptive practice was not directed to the market generally; the taxpayers did not hire the law firm to perform the services involved; the misrepresentation was made to the entities only in the context of a private agreement between the firm and the entities; and the entities are not the type of consumers the statute was intended to protect.

        ANNOTATION
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <b>
     The general assembly expressly stated its intent that penalties imposed under subsection (1) are civil in nature.
    </b>
    Moreover, the fact that the legislature provided that civil enforcement proceedings are to be governed by the Colorado rules of civil procedure reinforces the legislature's intent to create a civil penalty. Duncan v. Norton, 974 F. Supp. 1328 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1997</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Subsection (1) aids the Colorado Consumer Protection Act's (CCPA's) overall remedial purpose of protecting the state's consumers against deceptive trade practices and is therefore properly characterized as serving primarily a remedial, and also a punitive, purpose.
    </b>
    Duncan v. Norton, 974 F. Supp. 1328 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1997</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Federal court declined to find that any amount of penalty imposed in the civil enforcement proceeding under subsection (1) would be so far criminal in nature as to preclude the attorney general from seeking penalties by use of plaintiff's prior compelled testimony.
    </b>
    Duncan v. Norton, 974 F. Supp. 1328 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1997</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Civil penalties based on the dissemination of misleading information
    </b>
    rather than on the receipt of the information or on a consumer acting on the information effectuate the purpose of the statute. May Dept. Stores v. State, 863 P.2d 967 (Colo. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Statute is intended to punish wrongdoer
    </b>
    not compensate injured party. May Dept. Stores v. State, 863 P.2d 967 (Colo. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     "Each consumer or transaction" contemplates two separate violations,
    </b>
    one involving a consumer and one involving a transaction. A consumer relying or acting upon an advertisement is a separate and distinct violation from the act of advertising. Consumer involvement almost necessarily involves injury while a transaction does not have to cause actual injury to the consumer to be a violation. May Dept. Stores v. State, 863 P.2d 967 (Colo. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Borrower's affidavits were inadmissible hearsay
    </b>
    and could not be used to determine the remedy under the CCPA. Witnesses' testimony supported finding of a violation of the CCPA, but court's reliance on the affidavits to determine awards was in error. Though defendant had an opportunity to depose the affiants, this fact alone does not make the affidavits admissible, and no hearsay exception existed. People v. Shifrin,<cite class="COA">2014 COA 14</cite>, 342 P.3d 506.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not require an actual injury or loss
       </b>
       to a customer before a civil penalty may be awarded. State v. May Dept. Stores Co., 849 P.2d 802 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In determining the amount of a civil penalty award, the court should apply the following concepts:
       </b>
       (a) The good or bad faith of the defendant; (b) the injury to the public; (c) the defendant's ability to pay; and (d) the desire to eliminate the benefits derived by violations of the CCPA. State v. May Dept. Stores Co., 849 P.2d 802 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Because the court should consider several factors in its determination of the amount of civil penalties under this section,
    </b>
    an evidentiary hearing is required. People v. Wunder,<cite class="COA">2016 COA 46</cite>, 371 P.3d 785.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Civil penalties awarded under subsection (1) are nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(7).
    </b>
    The amounts awarded are penalties within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(7). In re Jensen, 395 B.R. 472 (Bankr. D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 2008</cite>).

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the use of telephones for commercial solicitation is rapidly increasing; that this form of communication offers unique benefits, but entails special risks and poses the potential for abuse; that the general assembly finds that the widespread practice of fraudulent and deceptive commercial telephone solicitation has caused substantial financial losses to thousands of consumers, and, particularly, elderly, homebound, and otherwise vulnerable consumers, and is a matter vitally affecting the public interest; and, therefore, that the general welfare of the public and the protection of the integrity of the telemarketing industry requires statutory regulation of the commercial use of telephones.

       It is the intent of the general assembly to encourage and promote independent living and self-sufficiency for persons with disabilities and to reduce their need to rely on publicly funded supports. Of an estimated forty-nine million Americans with disabilities, approximately seventy percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. Having safe, reliable assistive technology represents a most essential need given the many barriers to independent living and self-sufficiency people with disabilities face.

      <li id="t06-fairtradeandrestraintoftrade-ar01-p04-s6-1-401ol12">
       The goal of meeting this essential need can be furthered by assuring that assistive technology provided to persons with disabilities is of quality and is covered by adequate warranties to maintain their assistive technology in proper working condition, to assure availability of appropriate loaner replacement assistive technology while their own is being repaired, and to encourage manufacturers and dealers to cooperatively pool assistive technology resources for loaner purposes to assure availability without an undue burden.

        Colorado state courts have jurisdiction over private actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. § 227, under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, and the TCPA does not limit this jurisdiction, even assuming congress could do so.
       </b>
       When congress created a private right of action that could be prosecuted in state courts, it was acknowledging that the state could apply their own rules of procedure to such an action, but it did not intend to require that any state adopt a further law or rule of court to allow the prosecution of such actions in its courts. The supremacy clause requires the exercise of such jurisdiction as the state court possesses. Consumer Crusade, Inc. v. Affordable Health Care Solutions, Inc., 121 P.3d 350 (Colo. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        "If otherwise permitted" phrase under TCPA provisions creating a private right of action is merely an acknowledgment by congress that states have the right to structure their own court systems and that state courts are not obligated to change their procedural rules to accommodate TCPA claims.
       </b>
       Under this view, no state can refuse to entertain a private TCPA action, but a state is not compelled to adopt a special procedural rule for such actions. Consumer Crusade, Inc. v. Affordable Health Care Solutions, Inc., 121 P.3d 350 (Colo. App. 2005).

       <b>
     A four-part test determines whether the CCPA is penal in nature and whether a CCPA claim is assignable.
    </b>
    First, to be penal, a statute must create a new and distinct statutory cause of action. Second, the statute must require no proof of actual damages as a condition precedent to recovery. Third, the statute must impose a penalty in excess of actual damages. Finally, the statute must serve a public interest through a deterrent effect by the damages awarded. U.S. Fax Law Ctr., Inc. v. iHire, Inc., 374 F. Supp. 2d 924 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 2005</cite>); U.S. Fax Law Ctr., Inc. v. T2 Techs., Inc., 183 P.3d 626 (Colo.

        Under Colorado law, a claim for liquidated damages under the TCPA is a claim for a penalty that cannot be assigned.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that home ownership and the accumulation of equity in one's home provide significant social and economic benefits to the state and its citizens. Unfortunately, too many home owners in financial distress, especially the poor, elderly, and financially unsophisticated, are vulnerable to a variety of deceptive or unconscionable business practices designed to dispossess them or otherwise strip the equity from their homes. There is a compelling need to curtail and to prevent the most deceptive and unconscionable of these business practices, to provide each home owner with information necessary to make an informed and intelligent decision regarding transactions with certain foreclosure consultants and equity purchasers, to provide certain minimum requirements for contracts between such parties, including statutory rights to cancel such contracts, and to ensure and foster fair dealing in the sale and purchase of homes in foreclosure. Therefore, it is the intent of the general assembly that all violations of this part 11 have a significant public impact and that the terms of this part 11 be liberally construed to achieve these purposes.

For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that the home owner has a reasonable ability to make lease payments and to repurchase the residence in foreclosure if the home owner's payments for primary housing expenses and regular principal and interest payments on other personal debt do not exceed sixty percent of the home owner's monthly gross income; and

         The price the home owner must pay to exercise the option to repurchase the residence in foreclosure is not unconscionable. Without limitation on available claims under section  6-1-1119, a repurchase price exceeding twenty-five percent of the price at which the equity purchaser acquired the residence in foreclosure creates a rebuttable presumption that the reconveyance contract is unconscionable. The acquisition price paid by the equity purchaser may include any actual costs incurred by the equity purchaser in acquiring the residence in foreclosure.

        <b>
     Where a merchant is charged with selling goods at below cost
    </b>
    in violation of the unfair practices act, it is not error for the trial court to permit evidence to prove the actual intent animating the admitted sales below cost. Perkins v. King Soopers, Inc., 122<cite class="co_code">Colo. 263</cite>, 221 P.2d 343 (1950).
       </p>

        <b>
     A statute attempting to prohibit all sales below cost would be unconstitutional.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     To avoid this result, only such sales may be prohibited which are intended to injure the public
    </b>
    in a manner warranting the exercise of the police power. Olin Mathieson Chem. Corp. v. Francis, 134<cite class="co_code">Colo. 160</cite>, 301 P.2d 139 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Thus, intent has to be proved,
    </b>
    otherwise this section would be a flat fixing of prices without regard to the public welfare. Olin Mathieson Chem. Corp. v. Francis, 134<cite class="co_code">Colo. 160</cite>, 301 P.2d 139 (1956).
       </p>

        <b>
     Moreover, in action for violation of this section where company denied allegation that the advertisement of intent to give away
    </b>
    and the giving away of samples was done for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition, an issue of fact was tendered which could not be disposed of by a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Miller's Groceteria Co. v. Food Distribs. Ass'n, 107<cite class="co_code">Colo. 113</cite>, 109 P.2d 637 (1941).

         Where the ability to make a purchase at a concession price is expressly contingent on the purchase of other goods, the concession goods are sold below cost only if

        <b>
     Evidence which seeks to establish "cost" and "cost of doing business" need not be sufficient to establish these facts with mathematical precision
    </b>
    and exactness, the proof need not exist to that high degree of certainty. Flank Oil Co. v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., 141<cite class="co_code">Colo. 554</cite>, 349 P.2d 1005 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Such is a problem of sufficiency, not constitutionality.
    </b>
    Establishing by competent and material evidence allegations with respect to definitions of costs as applied to "production" and relative to "cost of doing business" or "overhead expense" is not a problem of constitutionality, but a problem of sufficiency of the evidence. Flank Oil Co. v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., 141<cite class="co_code">Colo. 554</cite>, 349 P.2d 1005 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Difficulty in application not enough to render section unconstitutional.
    </b>
    Any difficulty in computing cost is a factual one, and this section is not to be declared invalid because in its application factual difficulties may arise; mere difficulty of application in the processes of litigation is not enough to enable a court to say that a statute is unconstitutional. Flank Oil Co. v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., 141<cite class="co_code">Colo. 554</cite>, 349 P.2d 1005 (1960).

        <b>
     Moreover, the term "cost" or "cost of doing business" is not so vague and indefinite that it violates the substantive due process requirement

    of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution or is so vague that it is wholly impractical. Flank Oil Co. v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., 141<cite class="co_code">Colo. 554</cite>, 349 P.2d 1005 (1960).

       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
     The "cost of doing business" which must be added to the invoice cost

    need not be absolutely exact or based upon a precise method of accounting which any one merchant might adopt. Dikeou v. Food Distribs. Ass'n, 107<cite class="co_code">Colo. 38</cite>, 108 P.2d 529 (1940); Flank Oil Co. v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., 141<cite class="co_code">Colo. 554</cite>, 349 P.2d 1005 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Rather, the term means the approximate cost
    </b>
    arrived at by a reasonable rule. Dikeou v. Food Distribs. Ass'n, 107<cite class="co_code">Colo. 38</cite>, 108 P.2d 529 (1940); Flank Oil Co. v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., 141<cite class="co_code">Colo. 554</cite>, 349 P.2d 1005 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Hence, if a particular method adopted by a merchant cannot be said to be unreasonable,
    </b>
    and does not disclose an intentional evasion of the law, the method so adopted should be accepted as correct. Dikeou v. Food Distribs. Ass'n, 107<cite class="co_code">Colo. 38</cite>, 108 P.2d 529 (1940); Flank Oil Co. v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., 141<cite class="co_code">Colo. 554</cite>, 349 P.2d 1005 (1960).

     <p>
      In establishing the cost of a given product to the distributor and vendor, the invoice cost of the product purchased at a forced, bankrupt, closeout sale, or other sale outside of the ordinary channels of trade may not be used as a basis for justifying a price lower than one based upon the replacement cost as of date of said sale of the product replaced through the ordinary channels of trade, unless the product is kept separate from goods purchased in the ordinary channels of trade and unless the product is advertised and sold as merchandise purchased at a forced, bankrupt, closeout sale, or by means other than through the ordinary channels of trade. The advertising shall state the conditions under which said goods were purchased and the quantity of such merchandise to be sold or offered for sale.

     Where an injunction is sought, this section is viewed
    </b>
    from the standpoint not of the prudent man, but rather from the standpoint of the judge hearing the case; therefore, the proper test is whether the standards contained in the statutory provisions are so vague as to make it impossible to adjudicate rights arising out of their provisions.

     In an injunction action, prospective in effect, the terms "cost" and "cost of doing business" are not so indefinite

     Furthermore, the adjudication itself provides notice to defendant.
    </b>
    When a plaintiff seeks an injunction he is not demanding that the defendant be punished, but rather that he be restrained from acting unlawfully in the future. Consequently, the adjudication itself provides notice to the defendant and is prospective in its application, and the result is that the defendant is not prejudiced by the failure of the statute to provide precise and adequate warning beforehand. Where, however, the requested sanction is penal or criminal, there is a reasonable basis for requiring it to give actual prior notice so that men of common intelligence are not required to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.

       <b>
     Purpose of state antitrust legislation.
    </b>
    State antitrust legislation serves the important function of protecting the public against illegal trade restraints beyond the reach of federal law, without undercutting the legitimate rights of employees to engage in lawful, concerted activities for the purpose of improving their wages, hours and other conditions of employment. People v. North Ave. Furn. &amp; Appliance, Inc., 645 P.2d 1291 (Colo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Antitrust statute, as does its federal counterpart, reaches only those contracts or combinations in restraint of trade which unreasonably restrain trade or are designed to destroy competition in a particular market. People v. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors, 692 P.2d 1055 (Colo. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Illegal restraint of trade act applicable to title insurance.
       </b>
       The state's illegal restraint of trade act is applicable to the business of title insurance. Commander Leasing Co. v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co., 477 F.2d 77 (10th Cir. 1973).
      </p>

       <b>
        A coroner may not conspire with a private funeral home to acquire business for the funeral home
       </b>
       through the discharge of his public duties in restraint of trade among all private funeral homes. People ex rel. Kinsey v. Sumner, 34 Colo. App. 61, 525 P.2d 512 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     What establishes restraint of trade.
    </b>
    Plaintiffs have a remedy under the Colorado restraint of trade act only to the extent that they can establish that there was a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce in Colorado, or a combination or conspiracy fixing prices, or a combination and conspiracy which monopolized or attempted to monopolize trade or commerce in Colorado. Q-T Mkts., Inc. v. Fleming Cos., 394 F. Supp. 1102 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1975</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Federal antitrust laws.
    </b>
    Federal and state antitrust statutes serve complementary purposes. In view of their common goals of preserving free competition and protecting the public against illegal restraints of trade, the antitrust decisions of the United States supreme court are entitled to careful consideration in determining the meaning and scope of the Colorado antitrust statute. People v. North Ave. Furn. &amp; Appliance, Inc., 645 P.2d 1291 (Colo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Economic power
       </b>
       means that a single seller possesses the ability to raise prices and restrict output for the product in the relevant market. Economic power can be established by showing that the tying product is unavailable elsewhere or is particularly unique and desirable or that the defendant has a dominant position in the tying market. Factual uniqueness alone is insufficient. The markets in which products are sold is the focus of any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement. The impact on competition of a single forced sale of a tied product to a single customer is never sufficient to warrant a finding of market power over the tying product. McCormick v. Bradley, 870 P.2d 599 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>

     No claim presented under this section

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Three types of restraint of trade.
    </b>
    The two sentences in this section appear to define three different types of illegal restraints of trade. Q-T Mkts., Inc. v. Fleming Cos., 394 F. Supp. 1102 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1975</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Monopolization limited to conspiracy, etc.
    </b>
    Given the grammar of this section, it must be concluded that monopolization or attempted monopolization is limited to a combination, conspiracy, trust, or pool because it is inconceivable that a contract or agreement could, in itself, monopolize or attempt to monopolize trade or commerce. Q-T Mkts., Inc. v. Fleming Cos., 394 F. Supp. 1102 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1975</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Group boycott.
    </b>
    The term "group boycott" refers to a concerted refusal by traders to deal with competitors. Under the circumstances, the state failed to establish that requirement of board of realtors membership for access to multiple listing service was group boycott or refusal to deal with competitors which constituted per se violation of antitrust statute. People v. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors, 692 P.2d 1055 (Colo. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     An illegal tying contract
    </b>
    is irrelevant to this section because such contracts are not prohibited by it. Q-T Mkts., Inc. v. Fleming Cos., 394 F. Supp. 1102 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1975</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Tying arrangement.
    </b>
    The essential characteristic of any tying arrangement is an agreement to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchase a different (or tied) product. Tying arrangements constitute unreasonable restraints of trade in and of themselves per se whenever a party has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product and a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce is affected, but mere fact that goods or services are sold in combination does not establish prohibited tying arrangement. People v. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors, 692 P.2d 1055 (Colo. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Test applied in McCormick v. Bradley, 870 P.2d 599 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Determination of violation.
    </b>
    Any particular business agreement, combination, or arrangement may in some circumstances be determined to constitute a per se violation of the statute, without the necessity of proving actual anti-competitive impact on the particular market involved. Additionally, a business arrangement which does not per se violate antitrust law nevertheless may be found to constitute an illegal arrangement under the rule of reason analysis articulated by the United States supreme court. Thus, in determining whether particular conduct violates this section, a trial court must normally determine whether the challenged arrangement is illegal per se. If no per se violation is established, the court may be required to apply the rule of reason analysis to the challenged conduct. People v. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors, 692 P.2d 1055 (Colo. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Test applied in McCormick v. Bradley, 870 P.2d 599 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Where violation of statute
    </b>
    consisted of the adoption of two specific membership criteria, and neither criteria were applied to deny membership to any applicant, nor were any damages sustained by any party as the result of the violator's adoption of such criteria, the appropriate sanction is to prohibit the violator from enforcing the offensive membership criteria. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors v. State, 780 P.2d 494 (Colo. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Per se antitrust violation.
       </b>
       Developer's requirement that only approved builders may construct homes on lots is not a per se antitrust violation where unapproved builder failed to establish a substantial amount of commerce within the tied market had been foreclosed. McCormick v. Bradley, 870 P.2d 599 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Rule of reason
    </b>
    required the trial court to weigh the pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of the two membership criteria. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors v. State, 780 P.2d 494 (Colo. 1989); McCormick v. Bradley, 870 P.2d 599 (Colo. App. 1993).

     In terms of evidentiary production,
    </b>
    no bright line is available to distinguish per se from rule of reason analysis. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors v. State, 780 P.2d 494 (Colo. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
     Where court applied rule of reason analysis
    </b>
    to facts of case and concluded that anti-competitive effects of certain criteria outweighed any pro-competitive results their adoption might have engendered, in adopting these two membership criteria the violator improperly refused to deal with competitors and that such group boycott violated this section. Colo. Springs Bd. of Realtors v. State, 780 P.2d 494 (Colo. 1989).

          A general assignment is an act of bankruptcy.
         </b>
         A general assignment, filed and recorded in pursuance of the statutes of Colorado, falls far within the established rule that the general assignment declared by the bankruptcy act to constitute an act of bankruptcy embraces any conveyance at common law or pursuant to statute by which the assignor intends to make and does make an absolute appropriation of his property not exempt from levy to pay all his debts, although there may be some defect in the conveyance or some failure to comply with some law or statute in the proceeding he takes to effectuate his intention which does not prevent the actual appropriation of his property for the benefit of his creditors.

          III. TITLE OF ASSIGNEE.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         <b>
     Section applies whether assignor is solvent or insolvent.
    </b>
    This provision regulating the administration of trusts created by voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors applies whether the assignor is solvent or insolvent. In re Carlson's for Music, Inc. v. Gould, 176<cite class="co_code">Colo. 172</cite>, 489 P.2d 1038 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Such an assignment implies a trust
         </b>
         and contemplates the intervention of a trustee. May v. Tenney, 148 U.S. 60, 13 S. Ct. 491, 37 L. Ed. 368 (1893).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     The intent of this section appears to be to make the assignee not the mere representative of the assignor but the trustee of the assignor and the creditors
    </b>
    for the purpose of marshaling the assets of the assignor for pro rata distribution among the creditors, returning the surplus, if any, to the assignor. Clark v. Bright, 30<cite class="co_code">Colo. 199</cite>, 69 P. 506 (1902).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Hence, the assignee becomes vested with right and title to the estate of the assignors for the purpose of paying the debts
    </b>
    of the assignors in full, if sufficient therefor; if not, then ratably, except only as to the preference created by the said legislative enactment. And the assignee becomes charged with the duty of collecting the personal assets, wherever they might be found, and of distributing the proceeds of the entire estate among the creditors according to the provisions of this enactment. Ray v. Hiller, 11<cite class="co_code">Colo. 445</cite>, 18 P. 622 (1888).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Furthermore, it is by the language of the deed that the title of the assignee must be determined,
         </b>
         without reference either to the inventory or the list of creditors. Falk v. Liebes, 6 Colo. App. 473, 42 P. 46 (1895).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          If all requisites are not met assignee takes no title.
         </b>
         If a deed of assignment fails in the essential particular specified by this section the want cannot be supplied by judicial decision; the deed would not invest the assignee with any title, and creditors could proceed against the debtor in the same manner and with the same effect as if no assignment had been attempted. Kellogg v. Thropp, 4 Colo. App. 470, 36 P. 447 (1894).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Property vests in assignee only when instrument is filed.
    </b>
    The plain and necessary inference from the provision of this section that the instrument "when filed, etc. shall vest" is that when not filed it shall not vest. Kinney v. Yoelin Bros. Mercantile Co., 76<cite class="co_code">Colo. 136</cite>, 230 P. 127 (1924).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          This means a filing for record in the proper county.
         </b>
         Spangler v. Sanborn, 7 Colo. App. 102, 43 P. 905 (1895).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Nevertheless, this section does not make the record of the deed of assignment constructive notice
    </b>
    to creditors, and the fact that notice is specifically provided for elsewhere, (as in § <cite class="occo"><a href="gov.co.crs.title.06.html#t06-assignmentsingeneral-ar10-s6-10-108" target="_self"> 6-10-108</a></cite>), is evidence that it was not intended to be such. Kinney v. Yoelin Bros. Mercantile Co., 76<cite class="co_code">Colo. 136</cite>, 230 P. 127 (1924).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Thus, title does not pass if instrument is not recorded.
    </b>
    A power of attorney given by a debtor to an assignee for the benefit of creditors does not pass title as against creditors where it is not recorded in accordance with this section. Kinney v. Yoelin Bros. Mercantile Co., 76<cite class="co_code">Colo. 136</cite>, 230 P. 127 (1924).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          However, a deed of assignment does not destroy valid antecedent liens
         </b>
         upon the assignor's property, nor the right of the holder to enforce them. Nat'l Bank of Commerce v. Graham, 16 Colo. App. 498, 66 P. 684 (1901).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Since the assignee takes the property subject to all subsisting valid liens.

          Where a corporation makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors and a receiver, later appointed, files a motion
         </b>
         in the assignment proceedings asking the dismissal of the assignment proceedings and an order to compel the assignee to turn over to the receiver the property of the corporation, the title of the assignee to the property cannot be determined in such a proceeding.

        not that the preferences fail and the assignment stands, but that the assignment itself fails unless it be in terms free from preferences. May v. Tenney, 148 U.S. 60, 13 S. Ct. 491, 37 L. Ed. 368 (1893).

         At common law there was no restriction

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Subject to the statutory provisions governing general assignments, this common-law right remains

        <b>
         Thus, right to prefer creditors remains unimpaired if debtor retains dominion over property.
        </b>
        There is nothing in this section from which it can be implied that it was the purpose of the general assembly to prevent a debtor, insolvent or not, from securing or paying one of his creditors in preference to another while he retains dominion over his property, except as he undertakes to do so in a deed of general assignment executed pursuant to the statute. Kellogg v. Thropp, 4 Colo. App. 470, 36 P. 447 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Lawful preferences working no prejudice to creditors are allowed.
        </b>
        Where one secures a lawful preference by its superior diligence before a bill of sale in its favor is executed, no creditor of the debtor is prejudiced by the conveyance, inasmuch as such a conveyance makes the same disposition of the proceeds of the attached property which the law would have made if the attachment suit had been regularly prosecuted to final judgment. At common law the debtor had an undoubted right to enter into such an arrangement with his creditor, and there is no sufficient reason why the assignment act should receive a construction which will interdict such arrangements, if they are entered into in good faith and are not conceived with a view of evading the provisions of the assignment law. Hayden v. Wellington, 63 F. 6 (8th Cir. 1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Moreover, a secured creditor having credited upon his debt the proceeds of his security has a right to participate

        with other creditors and upon an equal footing with them in the assets realized from the assignment to the extent of the unpaid residue of his debt. Nat'l Bank of Commerce v. Graham, 16 Colo. App. 498, 66 P. 684 (1901).
       </p>

     The purpose of this section is

    not to discourage or restrain the making of general assignments, but to inhibit partiality therein toward favored creditors. Campbell v. Colo. Coal &amp; Iron Co., 9<cite class="co_code">Colo. 60</cite>, 10 P. 248 (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The provisions of this section that are regulatory of voluntary assignments serve to protect creditors
    </b>
    against each other and go to assure equality of distribution unaffected by any requirement or condition in respect of discharge. In re Carlson's for Music, Inc. v. Gould, 176<cite class="co_code">Colo. 172</cite>, 489 P.2d 1038 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Thus, ratable participation must be provided for.
        </b>
        When one voluntarily undertakes by deed of assignment to avail himself of the statute, he must make express provision for the ratable participation by his creditors in its benefits, or the deed is void. Kellogg v. Thropp, 4 Colo. App. 470, 36 P. 447 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     An instrument which, in form an irrevocable power of attorney and obviously intended to operate as an assignment for the benefit of all creditors equally
    </b>
    and without preference is, at least when possession is taken thereunder, a common-law assignment for the benefit of creditors. McMinn v. Harrison, 93<cite class="co_code">Colo. 5</cite>, 23 P.2d 944 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         When a deed of assignment is not made for the benefit of all creditors,

        and some of them are expressly and by intention excluded from its benefits, the deed cannot be upheld. Stevens v. Mosconi, 5 Colo. App. 484, 39 P. 348 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         So a conveyance, unquestionably a general assignment, in form which contemplates the payment only two creditors
        </b>
        is not only not for the benefit of all creditors, but avowedly for the benefit of the two, and would, therefore, have to be adjudged a void instrument. May v. Tenney, 148 U.S. 60, 13 S. Ct. 491, 37 L. Ed. 368 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Such an assignment, whether so intended or not, is fraudulent
        </b>
        under this section as not being for the benefit of all the creditors if it makes those who are named and scheduled preferred creditors. Burchinell v. Mosconi, 4 Colo. App. 401, 36 P. 307 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Fraud and illegality must be pleaded in court below.
    </b>
    Where it is alleged that an assignment in favor of certain creditors to the exclusion of others is in violation of this section but no fraud or illegality in the assignment is pleaded nor is any such question in any manner raised in the court below, it need not be determined on appeal whether such a defense can or cannot be successfully interposed. Marsh v. Cramer, 16<cite class="co_code">Colo. 331</cite>, 27 P. 169 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Furthermore, a preference by separate transaction shows intent to violate section.
        </b>
        The fact that a preference is not provided for in an assignment itself, but by an arrangement or transfer outside of it and contemporaneous with it, shows the intent to evade and violate this section. Doggett, Bassett & Hills Co. v. Herman, 16 F. 812 (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where the preference is by actual delivery to the preferred creditors
        </b>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Section does not invalidate bill of sale paying only part of debts if assignment act not relied upon.
        </b>
        A bill of sale is not rendered invalid by the provisions of this section although it operates to transfer all of the debtor's property to a third party for the purpose of paying a portion only of his debts where it is apparent that the debtor did not intend to proceed under the assignment act or to take advantage of any of its provisions. Hayden v. Wellington, 63 F. 6 (8th Cir. 1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     This section is not construed as prohibiting or interfering with the making of partial assignments;
    </b>
    so far as the statute is concerned, such assignments are perfectly valid. Campbell v. Colo. Coal &amp; Iron Co., 9<cite class="co_code">Colo. 60</cite>, 10 P. 248 (1885).
       </p>

         This section contains no provisions which can be held to preclude a citizen of this state from attaching the property of another
        </b>
        citizen of the state, either at home or in a foreign jurisdiction, merely because the latter has become insolvent, and because such attachment may result in a preference. Schindelholz v. Cullum, 55 F. 885 (8th Cir. 1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Under the legislative enactment of 1881,
    </b>
    had there been any attempt by the assignment to prefer creditors, such attempt would have been without effect to either prefer creditors, or to vitiate the deed, so as to defeat a ratable distribution of the proceeds of the entire estate among all the creditors. Campbell v. Colo. Coal &amp; Iron Co., 9<cite class="co_code">Colo. 60</cite>, 10 P. 248 (1885); Ray v. Hiller, 11<cite class="co_code">Colo. 445</cite>, 18 P. 622 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Under the early statute,
    </b>
    it was held that the fact that an insolvent debtor clearly attempted to evade this section by preferring certain creditors in separate transfers or instruments conveying portions of his property at or about the time he made a general assignment, if such fact was established, may be a reason for avoiding the preferences so given in a suit by or on behalf of injured creditors; but it was not a reason for declaring the assignment itself invalid. The assignment, this being the only objection thereto, might well be permitted to stand, and the property included be distributed ratably by the assignee among the creditors. Campbell v. Colo. Coal &amp; Iron Co., 9<cite class="co_code">Colo. 60</cite>, 10 P. 248 (1885).

         The assignee stands in the shoes of his assignor,

         The authority of the assignee is derived from the statute

         Therefore, the powers which an assignor may assume to grant by his deed are without effect;

         Whenever an estate passes to an assignee for distribution among creditors, the assignee is not obligated to accept assets

        If the assignee should attempt to accept assets which would prove a burden rather than an advantage, the creditors would not be without remedy and they might apply to the court having original jurisdiction in the matter to compel him to take the course which was for the best interests of the creditors generally.

     At common law an assignee took only that interest which the debtor had

      <p>
       The court, upon the application of the assignee, or of any creditor, may compel the appearance in person of the debtor, or any other witness, before the court, or a commissioner appointed by the court, at any time designated, to answer under oath such matters as may be inquired of him. Such debtor or other witness may then be fully examined under oath as to the amount and situation of his property, the payments and conveyances made by him, and the names and places of residence of creditors and the amounts due to each. The court, upon like application, may compel the debtor to deliver to the assignee any property or estate embraced in the assignment.

      <p>
       No assignment shall be invalid because of misappropriation of the property of the debtor by him prior to the assignment, but the assignee may recover such property, if so misappropriated in fraud of this article. Nothing in this article shall invalidate any conveyance or mortgage of property, real or personal, by the debtor before the assignment, made in good faith, for a valid and valuable consideration.

      <p>
       No mortgage, deed of trust, or other security, real or personal, securing the payment of claims against the assigned estate shall be foreclosed within one year from the making of the assignment except upon order of court. No such mortgage, deed of trust, or other security shall be foreclosed except by suit, unless the claim secured is first proved and allowed by such court. When such claim is so proved and allowed, the court may order a foreclosure of the mortgage, deed of trust, or other security within one year from the making of the assignment. The lien of the mortgage, trust deed, or other security affected by this article shall not be impaired by the suspension of the remedy provided in this section.

      <p>
       In all assignments for the benefit of creditors made in this state, the district court in and for the county in which such deed of assignment is recorded as now provided by law has full power and complete jurisdiction over all the property, real, personal, and mixed, conveyed by such assignment from the date of the making of the same. The court may make any order in reference to any part or all of the property embraced in the estate and the disposition thereof by the assignee which to the court seems just and equitable, and all such orders shall be legal and binding upon the assignor, the assignee, and creditors of the estate whether or not any notice is given of the application therefor or the order so made; except that the court may in its discretion require notice of such an application so made to be given in reference to any matter that may come before it for hearing, and in such case it shall direct, by an order, the form and manner of giving such notice so required by it.

       When any difficulty is encountered by the assignee in converting the assigned property of any assignment, or any part thereof, into cash on account of there being no sufficient market therefor, or for any other good reason, the court may direct by such order as described in section

       the distribution of such property in kind among the creditors electing to take property. Creditors not electing to take property shall be paid an equal pro rata in cash, fixing by appraisement or sworn evidence in courts such price or value upon each piece, parcel, or item of property as shall make it bear and pay its proportion of the entire indebtedness of the estate, and as shall be just and equitable between the assignor and the creditors and all persons interested in the assigned estate. When the court authorizes the assignee to exchange such property in payment of the proved indebtedness of the estate at the prices so fixed, and when, in the opinion of the court, the best interests of the estate are promoted thereby, it may order the assignee to first offer such property at public auction; and, in that case, it shall provide by its order the kind and form of notice to be given of such sale. The assignee at such sale shall offer and sell the property to the highest and best bidder therefor in proved accounts against the estate, and he shall not accept any bid lower than the price fixed by the court on the property so offered.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The general assembly hereby finds that fraudulent charitable solicitations are a widespread practice in this state that results in millions of dollars of losses to contributors and legitimate charities each year. Legitimate charities are harmed by such fraud because the money available for contributions continually is being siphoned off by fraudulent charities, and the goodwill and confidence of contributors continually is being undermined by the practices of unscrupulous solicitors. The general assembly further finds that legitimate charities provide many public benefits and that charitable donations are a direct result of public trust in charities. The general assembly therefore finds that the provisions of this article, including those involving pertinent information to be filed in a timely manner by charitable organizations and disclosures to be made by paid solicitors, are necessary to protect the public's interest in making informed choices as to which charitable causes should be supported. Furthermore, these provisions are intended to help the secretary of state investigate allegations of wrongdoing in charities, without having a chilling effect on donors who wish to give anonymously or requiring public disclosure of confidential information about charities.

        <b>
     The disclosure mandated by subsection (1)(d) is unconstitutional.
    </b>
    Subsection (1)(d) violates the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind v. Norton, 981 F. Supp. 1371 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1997</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Subsection (1)(d) is not narrowly tailored to the general assembly's stated purpose of fraud prevention.
    </b>
    The state could publish or otherwise publicize the rights of donors to rescind telephone contributions, thereby educating the public without burdening the free speech rights of a specific category of charitable fundraisers, namely paid solicitors. Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind v. Norton, 981 F. Supp. 1371 (D.<cite class="co_code">Colo. 1997</cite>).

     By mandating that only paid fundraisers tell donors they have three days to rescind their pledge, subsection (1)(d) harms and discriminates against only those charities that rely on paid fundraisers.

       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the rapidly changing health care market provides unique opportunities for health care providers to organize themselves into new forms of collaborative systems to deliver high quality health care at competitive market prices to cooperatives and other purchasers. This part 3 is enacted to encourage such collaborative arrangements and to further market-based competition among health care providers.
      </li>
      <li id="t06-healthcarecoveragecooperatives-ar18-p03-s6-18-301ol12">
       The general assembly further recognizes that in order to achieve the most effective use of resources and medical technology to respond to changing market conditions, providers who would otherwise be competitors with each other will need to horizontally integrate in order to develop collaborative arrangements to guarantee an adequate number of providers to service the market and to vertically integrate in order to guarantee that those who receive services will have a continuum of care as appropriate to their care needs.
      </li>
      <li id="t06-healthcarecoveragecooperatives-ar18-p03-s6-18-301ol13">
       The general assembly also recognizes that to effect such new forms of collaborative systems and integration of providers to service the market will require an analysis of existing methods of providing services, contracting, collaborating, and networking among providers and the extent and type of regulatory oversight of licensed provider networks or licensed individual providers which is appropriate to protect the public.

       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that all licensed and certified hospitals provide a service to the public by making health care services available to the communities they serve.
      </li>
      <li id="t06-transactionsinvolvinglicensedhospitals-ar19-p01-s6-19-101ol12">
       Furthermore, for purposes of the attorney general's authority over the transfer of nonprofit hospital assets, all nonprofit hospitals shall be deemed to hold all of their assets in trust, and those assets shall be deemed to be dedicated to the specific charitable purposes set forth in the articles of incorporation or other organic documents of the nonprofit entities that hold them in trust. The public is the beneficiary of this trust. Nonprofit hospitals have a substantial and beneficial effect on the provision of health care to the people of Colorado, providing as part of their charitable purposes uncompensated care to the uninsured or underinsured and including, but not limited to, providing moneys and support for health-related research and education or other community benefits. The general assembly also finds that transfers of the assets of nonprofit hospitals to the for-profit sector may directly affect the character and extent of the charitable use of those assets or the proceeds from the assets. The public also has an interest in knowing that the transfer of the assets of a nonprofit hospital, or the proceeds from the assets, preserves, to the extent practicable, their charitable purpose. The general assembly believes it is in the best interest of the public to ensure that the public interest is fully protected whenever the assets of a hospital are transferred to a for-profit entity except in the ordinary course of business.
      </li>
      <li id="t06-transactionsinvolvinglicensedhospitals-ar19-p01-s6-19-101ol13">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that all transfers of hospital assets or control have the potential to impact the communities they serve. This article is intended to protect the public interest, to assure that nonprofit assets of hospitals are preserved to serve the charitable purposes to which they were dedicated, and to provide the public notice of all transfers of assets of hospitals that constitute covered transitions as defined in this article and shall be construed with these purposes in mind.

      <li id="t06-transactionsinvolvinglicensedhospitals-ar19-p01-s6-19-101ol14">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that the addition of the factors to be considered in relation to the term "material change" in section  6-19-203 (1) is intended to clarify the provisions of this article.
