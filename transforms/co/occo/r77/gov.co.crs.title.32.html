      This article was numbered as articles 8-10, 16-18, 22, and 26 of chapter 89, C.R.S. 1963. The provisions of this article were repealed and reenacted in 1981, resulting in the addition, relocation, and elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to this article prior to 1981, consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note and the table itemizing the replacement volumes and supplements to the original volume of C.R.S. 1973 beginning on page vii in the front of this volume. Former C.R.S. section numbers are shown in editor's notes following those sections that were relocated.

       Constitutional challenge to subsection (5) of this section
       on grounds that denying corporate entities the right to vote on the formation of a special district violates the equal protection clause was premature when no petition for organization was pending before district court. State Farm v. City of Lakewood, 788 P.2d 808 (Colo. 1990).

       District organizers' contracts did not make them eligible electors under subsection (5).
       The purpose of requiring a district to gain approval from persons who own property within a district before it imposes a new tax is to allow the people who will have to pay the tax to decide whether the tax should be levied. The organizers' contracts did not comport with this purpose because they were illusory. Landmark Towers Ass'n v. UMB Bank,
       <cite class="COA">
        2016 COA 61
       </cite>

      </p>
      <p>
       Organizers' contracts for options to purchase parcels were sham agreements.
       The size of the individual parcels was so small that ownership of such a parcel would not permit any beneficial use thereof; though the contracts purported to obligate the option holder to pay property taxes, they also waived any right to specific performance of the obligation to pay and any right to seek damages for any failure to pay, making the obligation to pay taxes illusory; one of the organizers testified, without contradiction, that the organizers agreed amongst themselves that none of them would have to pay taxes on the parcels; none of the organizers paid the down payment required by the option contracts; none of the organizers paid any property taxes; none of the organizers exercised their options to purchase; and none of the contracts was ever recorded in the real property records. Landmark Towers Ass'n v. UMB Bank,
       <cite class="COA">
        2016 COA 61
       </cite>

       Nothing in subsection (5)(b) indicates that a current obligation to pay property taxes at closing would not qualify a person with such an obligation as an eligible elector.
       Subsection (5)(b) qualifies those who are obligated to pay taxes under a contract to purchase taxable property within a special district as eligible electors in that district. The contracts required buyers to begin paying property taxes on their units at the time of closing. This obligation existed at the time of the TABOR election. Thus, buyers under contract to purchase units located in the special district were eligible electors. Landmark Towers Ass'n v. UMB Bank,
       <cite class="COA">
        2016 COA 61
       </cite>
       , 436 P.3d 1126, rev'd on other grounds, 2017 CO 107, 408 P.3d 836.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the buyers were eligible electors, they should have received notice of the election as constitutionally required by TABOR.

       Statute not applicable
       to special districts organized under law preceding the 1965 Special District Control Act. Senior Corp. v. Bd. of Assessment Appeals, 702 P.2d 732 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section contains no procedure for "reorganization",
       and in the absence of any legislatively created procedure for such, the court will not superimpose a judicially crafted "reorganization" procedure. Upper Bear Creek v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 715 P.2d 799 (Colo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       When determining whether there was a "material modification",
       the word "shall" in the service plan is part of the phrase "shall have the power and authority to finance, design, construct, acquire, install, maintain and provide services" and cannot be construed to relate to the infinitive verb forms of finance, design, construct, acquire, install, maintain, and provide. Thus, "shall" does not obligate the special district to acquire or operate the plan, but, instead, grants unconditional authority to the district to do so. Indian Mtn. v. Indian Mtn. Metro.,

       It is a material modification of a service plan
       when a special district expands its sanitation service authority to include water service and thus, pursuant to subsection (2), approval by the boards of county commissioners of the counties in which the special district is located is required. Upper Bear Creek v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 715 P.2d 799 (Colo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires ultimate rather than delegated action by the board of county commissioners for a material modification of a service plan.
       Approval from other county entities, such as the county attorney, the county planning commission, and the county community and economic development director, do not constitute approval from the board of county commissioners. Bill Barrett Corp. v. Lembke,
       <cite class="COA">

      </p>
      <p>
       District's geographic shifts, failure to implement services articulated in the service plan, and action to expand the service
       constituted material modifications to the service plan. Accordingly, the district must give notice to and seek approval for the modifications. Bill Barrett Corp. v. Sand Hills Metro.,
       <cite class="COA">
        2016 COA 144

      </p>
      <p>
       The board of county commissioners' approval was needed
       for material modification related to unincorporated area of a district whose original plan required approval only by the town within which it was contained entirely. Bill Barrett Corp. v. Sand Hills Metro.,
       <cite class="COA">

       A service plan providing that the special district "will" build specified recreation facilities obligates the special district to build those facilities
       unless the special district can demonstrate that plan compliance is no longer practicable. Plains Metro. Dist. v. Ken-Caryl Ranch, 250 P.3d 697 (Colo. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Special district's violation of its service plan can be remedied under subsection (3)(a).
       Although the claims alleging that the special district did not comply with its duty did not specifically allege a statutory cause of action or cite provisions governing "compliance" with and judicial "enforcement" of service plans, the substance of the requested relief was clear and consistent with the statute. Plains Metro. Dist. v. Ken-Caryl Ranch, 250 P.3d 697 (Colo. App. 2010).

       Quo warranto action in subsection (7) is exclusive means of attacking an order declaring a special district organized if an organizational election is used.

       District court statutorily barred under subsection (7) from setting aside order creating special district based on fraud on the court.
       The statute is specific in providing for review of an action by a district court only in a very narrow and time-constrained procedure that did not occur here. Where the authority of the court to enter an order in the first place emanates solely from a statutory grant from the legislature, as is the case with the organization of a special district, and that statutory grant contains a limitation on the power of the court to review the order once it is entered, court must defer to the legislative determination to place a limit on the review of such an order.

       This section is a remedial statute
       intended to facilitate the elimination of the overlapping of services provided by local governments and the double taxation which may occur because of annexation of municipal territory, when all or part of the annexed territory also lies within a special improvement district.

       Exclusive remedy.
       The entire purpose of the exclusion provisions -- to eliminate the overlapping of services and double taxation -- would be totally frustrated if a town were not allowed to petition for exclusion from the district. The statute provides no other remedy by which a town can avoid the necessity of paying for services which it already provides. In re Org. of N. Chaffee County Fire Prot. Dist., 190

       This section is not unconstitutionally vague and does not confer arbitrary and unlimited power on the trial court,
       but rather provides a specific statutory procedure for the exclusion of municipal territory from a special service district, as it sets forth conditions which a petitioning municipality must meet and which the trial court must find have been complied with in order to obtain exclusion from a district. City Council v. Bd. of Dirs. of S. Sub. Metro. Recreation &amp; Park Dist., 181

       Intent of section.
       The section is intended to ensure that the overall quality of the services provided will not be lower as a result of the exclusion of municipal territory. City &amp; County of Denver v. Bd. of Dirs. of Bancroft Fire Prot. Dist., 38
       <cite class="cocode">

      </p>
      <p>
       City may contract with others to furnish services.
       This section does not require that the city itself do the furnishing of services; it merely says it shall provide them, and if a city council chooses to contract with others to provide such services, it has the right to do so. City Council v. Bd. of Dirs. of S. Sub. Metro. Recreation &amp; Park Dist., 181
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 334

       , 509 P.2d 317 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       City need not prove intention to duplicate all services.
       While there was no evidence in the record to show that Denver could or would duplicate all of the services provided by the fire protection district, this section did not require Denver to prove its intention to do so. City &amp; County of Denver v. Bd. of Dirs. of Bancroft Fire Prot. Dist., 38
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. App. 53, 554 P.2d 714
       </cite>
       (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement in subsection (2)(b) that the service provided by the municipality will be the service provided by the special district
       does not require the municipality to be able to provide the service before the exclusion occurs. City Council v. S. Suburban Park, 160 P.3d 376 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a plan is fair and equitable,
       it is not necessary to determine that the exclusion of property from a special district would result in either an impairment of the quality of service or the imposition of an additional burden or expense on the special district before considering statutory criteria, including fair market value. City Council v. S. Suburban Park, 160 P.3d 376 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       The quality of service and additional burden language in subsection (2)(d) is an outer limit on the court's power to add provisions to the exclusion plan
       rather than a prerequisite to considering the statutory criteria in making the exclusion fair and equitable. City Council v. S. Suburban Park, 160 P.3d 376 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section directs the trial court to make provisions in the exclusion plan as the court finds fair and equitable
       and references fair market value as one factor the court should consider, it does not require a trial court to order a city to reimburse a special district for the fair market value of the transferred facilities. City Council v. S. Suburban Park, 160 P.3d 376 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors to be weighed.
       The trial court must weight the advantages and disadvantages of an exclusion to determine whether, on balance, the quality of service will not decline as a result of the exclusion. City &amp; County of Denver v. Bd. of Dirs. of Bancroft Fire Prot. Dist., 38
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. App. 53, 554 P.2d 714
       </cite>
       (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court bound by trial court's determination.
       As to whether the services to be provided by Denver in the future would not be of lower quality than those presently provided by the fire protection district, the appellate court is bound by the trial court's determination unless it is "clearly arbitrary and capricious". City &amp; County of Denver v. Bd. of Dirs. of Bancroft Fire Prot. Dist., 38
       <cite class="cocode">

       While the legality of annexation proceedings is being challenged in court, the disputed territory remains in the city
       subject to city taxes and assessments and is entitled to all city services. City Council v. Bd. of Dirs. of S. Sub. Metro. Recreation &amp; Park Dist., 181

       Property excluded from a fire protection district by a July 12, 1974 order
       was subject to all property taxes levied by the district for the 1974 taxable year, and for the taxable year 1975 and thereafter, the excluded territory was subject only to a levy for taxes for a pro rata share of the district's indebtedness outstanding on January 1, 1975.

       Property excluded from a special district pursuant to this section is still obligated to the same extent as all other property within the special district for purposes of retiring the special district's outstanding indebtedness existing at the time of the exclusion order.
       Excluded property is to be valued and assessed in the same manner, and subject to the same mill levy, as all other property in the district. In re Black Forest Fire/Rescue Prot. Dist., 85 P.3d 591 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Proportion", as used in this section, refers to the relationship between a special district's outstanding indebtedness prior to the exclusion of property and its total indebtedness.
       Nothing in the section suggests that "proportion" refers to any relationship between the assessed value of the excluded property and the assessed value of the district as a whole. In re Black Forest Fire/Rescue Prot. Dist., 85 P.3d 591 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court-ordered monetary transfer from the city to the special district upon exclusion is not double taxation for the same government service.
       The transfer of money to the special district was to compensate the district for its financial loss and was intended to support facilities outside of the city that will remain in the district. Taxes collected by the city and used to pay the transfer amount would serve a different purpose from taxes used to support facilities within the city that are excluded from the district.

The petition shall set forth clearly and concisely the objections of the petitioner, which objections shall be limited to the failure of any initiating district or concurring district to comply with this part 6, or, in a consolidation of services proceeding, duplication of service to the petitioner's property or territory by an existing municipality or special district not part of the proposed consolidated district or the provision of new and unwanted service to the petitioner's property by the proposed consolidated district.

The order shall require publication of notice as required by section  1-13.5-510, specifying the name of the consolidated district; the names of the special districts to be consolidated or the name of the district into which specific services are to be consolidated and the names of the special districts presently empowered to provide the services; a summary of any special conditions that may attach to the consolidated district, including any preconsolidation agreements and the provisions included therein regarding the assumption of debt and the approval of any financial obligation, including accrued unfunded pension liability, as debt to remain payable by the taxpayers of the consolidating special district which incurred the obligation or maintained the pension plan to which the accrued unfunded liability attaches; if the consolidated district may be granted the powers of a metropolitan district, the effect of the change and the services a metropolitan district may provide, including any change in maximum mill levies set forth in section  32-1-1101 (1), or, if the mill levy is unlimited, the fact that there is no mill levy limit established by statute; and the area to be included within the consolidated district, which shall be all of the area originally contained within the organization order for each individual special district, together with all areas contained in any inclusions, the consolidated area not to include any area excluded by any special district being so consolidated or by the court pursuant to subsection (2)(d) of this section. If two or more districts are to be consolidated and if the consolidated district is to assume metropolitan district powers, the court shall order that the eligible electors vote separately on the question of consolidation and the question of granting the consolidated district the powers of a metropolitan district. If the eligible electors approve consolidation but reject the granting of metropolitan district powers, the consolidated district shall have only those powers granted single-purpose districts providing the same services. If all or part of the outstanding bonded indebtedness of all of the consolidating special districts is to be assumed by the consolidated district, the court shall also order that the eligible electors vote separately on the question of consolidation and the question of assuming the indebtedness at the consolidation election. If the eligible electors approve consolidation but reject the assumption of indebtedness by the consolidated district, the outstanding bonded indebtedness shall remain the obligation of the special district which incurred the bonded indebtedness and shall be paid and discharged by the taxpayers having taxable property within the boundaries of the indebted special district. If a preconsolidation agreement provides that the consolidation shall be contingent upon assumption of debt by the consolidated district, then the consolidation shall not be approved unless the assumption of indebtedness is approved by the eligible electors. If any financial obligation of one or more of the consolidating districts is to be submitted to the electors for approval as debt, the court shall also order that the electors vote separately on the question of consolidation and the question of approval of each financial obligation as debt, which issue shall be presented to the electors in accordance with section  32-1-606.5. If the electors approve consolidation but do not approve the treatment of one or more financial obligations as debt, the financial obligations not so approved shall be assumed by the consolidated district in the same manner as other obligations of consolidating districts are assumed, unless a preconsolidation agreement providing that the consolidation shall be contingent upon the approval regarding treatment of the financial obligation as debt, in which case the consolidation shall not be approved. The area of the consolidated district after the election shall be the total area of the special districts consolidated existing as of the date of the court order. No appeal shall lie from any orders of the court.

       If primary purpose of condemnation is to advance private interests, the existence of an incidental public benefit does not prevent a court from finding "bad faith" and invalidating a condemning authority's determination that a particular acquisition is necessary.

       The board may adopt a resolution to divide the district into director districts. A district with a five-member board may be divided into five director districts and a district with a seven-member board may be divided into seven director districts. Each director district must have, as nearly as possible, the same number of eligible electors and shall be as contiguous and compact as possible. In making the division, the board shall consider existing or potential developments within the proposed director districts that, when completed, would, in the reasonably near future, increase or decrease the number of eligible electors within the director district. The board shall then select from its members a representative of each director district, and if possible, the representative shall be an eligible elector from within a boundary of the director district they are selected to represent. Thereafter, directors must be eligible electors of the director district that they represent. If, after a reasonable time, the board determines that it is in the best interest of the district to revert to a single district format, the board may eliminate the director districts and thereafter operate as a single district by adopting a resolution.

      <p>
       The statutory provision authorizing special districts to set their own fees for services is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.
       Statutory scheme, in conjunction with a special district's rules and regulations, is sufficient to prevent unnecessary and uncontrolled exercise of discretionary power by the special district. Krupp v. Breckenridge Sanitation Dist., 1 P.3d 178 (Colo. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A special district may assign its right to receive revenue from development fees to a private party.
       Such an assignment falls within a special district's statutory authority to dispose of property under subsection (1)(f). SDI, Inc. v. Pivotal Parker Commercial, LLC, 2014 CO 80, 339 P.3d 672.
      </p>
      <p>
       Underlying purpose of this section is to protect property holders and taxpayers.
       The advantage to be derived by individual bidders is merely incidental. Intermountain Sys. v. Gore Valley/Big Horn Water Dists., 654 P.2d 872 (Colo. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       If taxes have been improperly imposed against property owned by a park and recreation district, it is entitled to pursue a remedy therefor to the same extent as any other owner.

      </p>
      <p>
       A special district has the power to enter into contracts and agreements affecting its affairs, however,
       if a contract is beyond the scope of the special district's constitutional or statutory powers, the contract is ultra vires and consequently void. Black v. First Fed. Sav. and Loan, 830 P.2d 1103 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability for emergency services.
       A water and sanitation district can be held liable for additional services performed, valued at more than $5,000, although no competitive bids are obtained, when an emergency situation exists which demands immediate attention, and which threatens the public health and safety of a community. Martin Excavating, Inc. v. Tyrollean Terrace Water &amp; San. Dist., 671 P.2d 1329 (Colo. 1983) (decided under former §

      <p>
       Action to challenge propriety of award limited.
       This section creates a cause of action to challenge the propriety of an award only in taxpayers and property owners within the geographic limits of the contracting governmental body, and not in the unsuccessful bidder. Intermountain Sys. v. Gore Valley/Big Horn Water Dists., 654 P.2d 872 (Colo. App. 1982).

       Lowest bidder cannot compel contract.
       The lowest bidder cannot compel the issue of a writ of mandamus to force the officers of a municipality to enter into a contract with him. Intermountain Sys. v. Gore Valley/Big Horn Water Dists., 654 P.2d 872 (Colo. App. 1982).

       Special district, as a political subdivision of the state, possesses only those powers that are expressly conferred upon it
       by the constitution and by statute and such incidental implied powers as are reasonably necessary to carry out the express powers so conferred. Romer v. Fountain Sanitation Dist., 898 P.2d 37 (Colo. 1995).

      <p>
       Power to "sue and be sued" granted in subsection (1)(c) is not a grant of authority to file a civil action against the state for declaratory relief.

       Although a special district has the power to enter into contracts,
       if the contract is beyond the scope of its constitutional or statutory powers, the contract is ultra vires and void. Black v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 830 P.2d 1103 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, a special district may enter into a master lease.
       But, where the lease does not provide for cancellation by the special district during the term of the lease, the lease violates the constitutional prohibition against governmental debt by loan and is therefore ultra vires and void. Black v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 830 P.2d 1103 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a special district was also a limited partner, it was entitled to contract with itself.
       However, where the master lease entered into by the special district amounted to an unconstitutional governmental debt by loan, the special district's master lease was ultra vires and void. Black v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 830 P.2d 1103 (Colo. App. 1992).

       Special district has authority under subsection (1)(f) to regulate the use of and access to property it owns.
       A special district's authority to regulate use of its property and thereby exercise rights as a property owner is implied by the powers to acquire, own, and dispose of that property. Aspen Springs Metro. Dist. v. Keno,

       Language in this section authorizing special districts to charge fees for services furnished by the district implicitly requires that those fees be reasonable
       in light of the services actually furnished by the district. Krupp v. Breckenridge Sanitation Dist., 1 P.3d 178 (Colo. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory lien held by sanitation district that attached to debtors' real property pursuant to subsection (1)(j) survived debtors' bankruptcy proceedings.
       The question whether the district's lien was extinguished by the bankruptcy proceedings is governed by 11 U.S.C. § 1141 (c), which provides an exception to the general rule that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected. Because the debtors' plan of reorganization made no provision for the district's lien, the lien was not extinguished pursuant to § 1141 (c) upon confirmation of the plan. 250 Gregory LLC v. Black Hawk/Central City Sanitation Dist., 77 P.3d 841 (Colo. App. 2003).

       City may provide fire hydrants.
       Although a fire district may have the statutory authority to provide for fire hydrants and a supporting water system, the statute is permissive and the fire district is clearly not required to do so. The fact that the fire district has the power to provide for such a system does not prevent a city from providing a similar service as part of its water system. The city has the right, as an incident to the water system servicing the area, to install fire hydrants as part of this service. Dunford v. City of Thornton, 29

       And judicial review is available.
       To the extent that an employee is protected in his employment by the rules and regulations of the fire protection district, he has "tenure" and can only be deprived thereof for cause, under procedures adopted by the district. The employee is entitled to judicial review of the full procedures resulting in his discharge, and the board of directors can be required to answer. Maulding v. Schmitt, 162

       Board of directors must follow its own procedures for discharging firemen.
       When the board of directors establishes procedures concerning the manner in which firemen employed by them are to be subjected to censure or discharge, the board can not discharge a fireman without following the procedures prescribed by the rules. Maulding v. Schmitt, 162

       , means that the power of eminent domain is superior to that of other specific governmental subdivisions of the state, but not the state itself.
       Absent a contrary definition in the special district provisions, the court assumed that the general assembly intended that the term in subsection (1)(f) has a similar meaning, and, therefore, town and water and sanitation district were not authorized to condemn state-owned property to determine feasibility of recreation and water storage project.

       A special district's lease purchase agreement cannot be considered indebtedness within the meaning of subsection (1)(h)(I)(C)
       when the lease specifies that it does not constitute a debt or indebtedness, and, therefore, it may not be used to assess and calculate availability of service or facility charges. Skyland Metro. Dist. v. Mtn. W. Enter., LLC, 184 P.3d 106 (Colo. App. 2007).

       should be read together because both are part of the act that sets forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme for special districts.
       By using the words "mill levy allocable to such service", subsection (1)(h)(I)(E) refers to the process described in §
       <cite class="occo">

      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to subsection (1)(h)(I)(E), the indebtedness to be budgeted by a special district is the indebtedness due to accrue during the next year.
       Although the budget itself may later change, the calculation of availability of service or facility charges is to be based on the indebtedness then currently budgeted. Skyland Metro. Dist. v. Mtn. W. Enter., LLC, 184 P.3d 106 (Colo. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       The repeated time references in the statute are construed to mean
       that once the mill levy has been certified and allocated to debt service and a budget is in place for the indebtedness or bonds that will mature during the next year, the availability of service or facility charges budgeted at that time and expected to be derived shall not exceed the amount of that indebtedness or bonds, less the amount of the mill levy that has been allocated to debt service as certified pursuant to §

      <p>
       This section indicates a legislative intent to limit the availability of service or facility charges to a precise annual statutory calculation,
       not to expand the charges beyond those encompassed by the plain language of the statute, and to provide only for such portions of a district's principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness or bonds that are not otherwise covered in the certified mill levy.

       is immaterial
       to the assessment and calculation of a district's total availability of service or facility charge for the year at issue. Nothing in the language of this section suggests that the calculation may be revised when the budget changes or when other financial changes take place in the district. In addition, the total yearly calculation may not be recalculated based on an amended budget that is adopted later. Skyland Metro. Dist. v. Mtn. W. Enter., LLC, 184 P.3d 106 (Colo. App. 2007).

      The general assembly hereby declares this part 14 to be necessary in order to provide for the orderly and equitable payment of the obligations of local taxing districts organized under the provisions of this article, which payment may be effected by a plan of adjustment of the debts of such taxing districts under the federal bankruptcy law. The general assembly further declares that the necessity of such taxing districts availing themselves of the provisions of the federal bankruptcy law results from unanticipated economic and fiscal conditions affecting such taxing districts, rendering such taxing districts unable to discharge their indebtedness as the same becomes due and imposing a severe hardship on the taxpayers therein to the detriment not only of the credit of such taxing districts and that of all political subdivisions of the state of Colorado but also of the creditors of such taxing districts.

      The plan may include provisions for the modification of the existing contracts of the taxing district as evidenced by its bonds or otherwise. Such plan may adapt or alter the procedures provided by the statutes of Colorado for the levy, certification, and collection of general taxes to conform to the provisions of the court approved plan of adjustment, in accordance with federal bankruptcy law; except that nothing in this part 14 shall be construed to impair the rights of persons who have purchased property at tax sale. If the court approved plan provides for the issuance of new obligations of such taxing district for delivery to the creditors of the taxing district in exchange for outstanding obligations of such taxing district, such new obligations may be issued on the terms or conditions found in the plan of adjustment, regardless of any contrary state statute. Nothing in this part 14 shall impair the claims which creditors may have against persons who are not subject to jurisdiction of the court pursuant to chapter 9 of title 11, U.S.C. Any such plan proposed may provide for payments to creditors on terms and conditions which differ from the original contract if the present value of the total payments under the provisions of the plan do not exceed the present value of the total payments under the original contract.

      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that special districts are political subdivisions and instrumentalities of the state of Colorado and local governments thereof. The general assembly further finds that defaults in payment of general obligation debts and the possibility of further defaults by some special districts have resulted in a general loss of confidence by investors in bonds and undertakings of all types issued or to be issued by local governments of the state and have imposed severe hardship on investors in general obligation bonds of special districts and upon owners of residential real property within such districts. The general assembly further finds that this part 16 is necessary to protect the credit reputation of local governments of this state, to restore confidence of investors in local government obligations, and to protect owners of residential real property within special districts.

       Sewage disposal district under contract with city and county has same disposition rights as city and county.
       When sewage disposal district treats sewage under contract with city and county, the nature and extent of city and county's control over resulting effluent is same as if city and county had treated it, and whatever disposition city and county may make of effluent, sewage disposal district can make; whatever disposition city and county cannot make is proscribed to district.

       Sewage disposal districts not exempt from municipal building codes.
       While this section exempts sewage disposal districts from obtaining a municipal franchise, nothing in the statutory scheme evinces a legislative intent to exclude the districts organized thereunder from the application of municipal building codes. Metro. Denver Sewage v. Commerce City, 745 P.2d 1041 (Colo. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Labor Peace Act does not limit or constrain the law on metropolitan sewage disposal districts concerning the determination of prevailing rates of pay.
       Such a district is not required to negotiate or engage in collective bargaining in fixing employee compensation at prevailing rates for equivalent work. Local 1 v. Metro Wastewater Reclamation, 876 P.2d 82 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation, as used in this section, is defined as "remuneration and other benefits received in return for services rendered",
       therefore, sick leave is included in the term "compensation". Denver Local 2-477 v. Metro Wastewater Reclamation Dist., 7 P.3d 1042 (Colo. App. 1999).

       It is the duty of the body having authority to levy taxes within each county to levy the taxes provided in this part 5. It is the duty of all officials charged with the duty of collecting taxes to collect such taxes at the time and in the form and manner and with like interest and penalties as other general ad valorem taxes are collected and when collected to pay the same to the district or municipality ordering its levy and collection. The payment of such collection shall be made monthly to the treasurer of the district or municipality levying the tax and be paid into the depository thereof to the credit of such district or municipality. All general ad valorem taxes levied under this part 5, together with interest thereon and penalties for default in payment thereof, and all costs of collecting the same, shall constitute, until paid, a perpetual lien on and against the property taxed, and such lien shall be on a parity with the tax lien of other general ad valorem taxes.

If there are no bids at said tax sale for the property so offered, said property shall be struck off to the county, and the county shall account to the district or municipality to which the tax is due in the same manner as provided by law for accounting for school, town, and city taxes. Delinquent personal property shall be distrained and sold as provided by law.

      <p>
       The general assembly hereby declares that the purpose of this article is to implement the provisions of section 17 of article XIV of the state constitution, adopted at the 1970 general election, by providing for and facilitating the formation and operation of a limited number of service authorities in the state of Colorado. It is further declared that the orderly formation and operation of regional service authorities providing authorized functions, services, and facilities and exercising powers granted by this article will serve a public use and will promote the health, safety, security, and general welfare of the inhabitants thereof and the people of the state of Colorado. It is further declared to be the policy of the state of Colorado to encourage the utilization of single service authorities to provide those functions, services, and facilities which transcend local government boundaries, thus reducing the duplication, proliferation, and fragmentation of local governments, and encouraging establishment of efficient, effective, and responsive regional government. To these ends, this article shall be liberally construed.

        Formation of authority may not be frustrated by prior filing of petition.
        Implicit in the policy of this section, which encourages the creation of single service authorities transcending local government boundaries in the interest of more efficiently providing services to the inhabitants thereof, is the intention that the formation of such an authority may not be frustrated by the prior filing of a petition involving one of the same counties, in the same or in any other court, which then is allowed to become dormant and thus effectively to constitute a bar to the creation of any regional service authority. In re Reg'l Serv. Auth. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 199

        Those opposing authority's formation may not support petition, and vote against district's creation.
        Adequate political accommodation for those who may oppose the formation of a multi-governmental unit service authority lies in the option to refuse to sign or support a petition, and later in the right to vote against the creation of the district, as provided by §

        Power to create authority originates in constitution.
        The power to create a service authority originates in § 17 of art. XIV, Colo. Const. In re Reg'l Serv. Auth. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 199
        <cite class="co_code">

       <p>
        Method of creation is decision of general assembly.
        The method by which the creation of a service authority is to be accomplished is a decision within the discretion of the general assembly, subject only to constitutional restrictions and limitations. In re Reg'l Serv. Auth. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 199

        Those opposing authority's formation may not support petition and vote against district's creation.
        Adequate political accommodation for those who may oppose the formation of a multi-governmental unit service authority lies in the option to refuse to sign or support a petition, and later in the right to vote against the creation of the district, as provided by this section.

       <li id="t32-regionalserviceauthorities-ar07-s32-7-110ol11">
        The governing body of the service authority shall be a board of directors in which all legislative power of the service authority is vested. In those service authorities having a population in excess of five hundred thousand, the board shall consist of fifteen members, all of whom shall reside in and be elected by the eligible electors of the respective districts. In those service authorities having a population of at least fifty thousand but not more than five hundred thousand, the board shall consist of nine members, all of whom shall reside in and be elected by the eligible electors of the respective districts. In those service authorities having a population of less than fifty thousand, the board shall consist of five members, all of whom shall reside in and be elected by the eligible electors of the respective districts. At the formation election, the terms for representatives from odd-numbered districts shall continue until their successors are elected at the second general election thereafter and are qualified, and the terms for those elected from even-numbered districts shall continue until their successors are elected at the first general election thereafter and are qualified. Thereafter all terms shall be for four years. For the first five years after formation of any service authority, or until January 1, 1980, whichever occurs first, the members shall be eligible electors of the service authority and shall be elected from among the mayors, councilpersons, trustees, and county commissioners holding office at the time of their election in municipalities and counties within or partially within the authority. Thereafter, any eligible elector of the service authority shall be eligible to hold office. Notwithstanding any provision in the charter of any municipality or county to the contrary, mayors, councilpersons, trustees, and county commissioners may additionally hold elective office with the service authority and be compensated as provided in this section.
       </li>
       <li id="t32-regionalserviceauthorities-ar07-s32-7-110ol12">
        At least ninety days prior to the first general election after the formation of the service authority, the board may change the boundary of any board of director district within the service authority. Thereafter such boundaries may be changed no more frequently than every four years or after announcement of the results of a decennial census. The board shall redistrict only by resolution passed by a majority of the members elected to the board, and any such redistricting shall be such as to provide compact districts of approximately equal population. No redistricting shall extend or shorten the term of office of any member of the board.
       </li>
       <li id="t32-regionalserviceauthorities-ar07-s32-7-110ol13">
        The board has power, by appointment, to fill all vacancies on the board, and the person so appointed shall hold office until the next general election and until a successor is elected and qualified. Any person so appointed shall reside in the district in which the vacancy occurred. If the term of the member creating the vacancy extends beyond the next general election, the appointment shall be for the unexpired term.
       </li>
       <li id="t32-regionalserviceauthorities-ar07-s32-7-110ol14">
        The board shall elect a president, vice-president, secretary, and such other officers as it deems necessary. The president and vice-president must be members of the board. The board may appoint a chief administrator, who shall serve at the pleasure of the board. The board shall prescribe by resolution the duties of said officers pursuant to the powers granted in this article. In addition to other powers provided by resolution, the president shall preside over meetings of the board and shall vote as a member of the board. All special and regular meetings of the board shall be held at locations which are within the boundaries of the district or which are within the boundaries of any county in which the district is located, in whole or in part, or in any county so long as the meeting location does not exceed twenty miles from the district boundaries. The provisions of this subsection (4) governing the location of meetings may be waived only if the following criteria are met:

        The board may provide by resolution for the compensation of its members in the amount of fifty dollars for each day a member is necessarily engaged in the business of the authority, in addition to the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by each member while so engaged. Except for the initial board, the compensation of a member shall not be increased nor diminished during his term of office.

        In addition to any acts of the board specifically required to be accomplished by resolution, any action adopting or revising a budget, appropriating funds, establishing the administrative organization and structure, or promulgating regulations enforceable by fine or penalty shall be passed by resolution. Resolutions promulgating regulations enforceable by fine or penalty shall be published one time prior to final passage and within fourteen days after passage; publication after final passage may be by reference. At least six days shall elapse between introduction and final passage of a resolution. Such resolution shall not take effect and be enforced until the expiration of thirty days after final passage except resolutions calling for special elections or those necessary to the immediate preservation of the public health or safety, which shall contain the reasons making the same necessary in a separate section. The excepted resolutions shall take effect in five days, if passed by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of the board. All other actions of the board may be accomplished by motion.

       No general obligation or revenue bonds may be refunded unless the holders thereof voluntarily surrender them for exchange or payment, or unless they either mature or are callable for prior redemption under their terms within ten years from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds. Provision shall be made for paying the bonds refunded within said period of time. No maturity of any bond refunded may be extended over fifteen years.

Upon assuming the rights, title, and interest in any facility, the board shall become obligated to pay to the county, municipality, or special district, as the case may be, an amount, when due, equivalent to that necessary for the payment of all outstanding bonds and obligations of said jurisdictions for the acquisition, construction, and improvement of facilities acquired by the board.

       Annotator's note.
       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the constitutionality of article,
       see Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., 72
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 268
       </cite>
       , 211 P. 649 (1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this article
       is to benefit the people of the district created and to promote the public welfare, not to lend credit of the district to the Denver &amp; S. L. Ry. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist. v. Denver &amp; S. L. Ry., 45 F.2d 715 (10th Cir. 1930). See Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., 72
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 268
       </cite>
       , 211 P. 649 (1922); Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., 262 U.S. 710, 43 S. Ct. 694, 67 L. Ed. 1194 (1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the article cannot be construed as a mere lending of public credit to a private enterprise,
       for the Colorado constitution expressly forbids such, and the effort to construct the tunnel in 1913 was abortive for that particular reason. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist. v. Denver &amp; S. L. Ry., 45 F.2d 715 (10th Cir. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it appears that the main purpose of this article was to construct the tunnel for transportation and communication,
       a fair reading of the entire article supports the assertion that the general assembly intended the tunnel and its approaches to be put to the largest number of possible uses. Denver &amp; Rio Grande W. R. Co. v. Winter Park, 708 P.2d 1376 (Colo. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarity of Denver housing authority.
       Some of the points of similarity between the Moffat tunnel district and the Denver housing authority are: (a) Both districts include the city and county of Denver as a home-rule city; (b) both are by the express terms of the acts creating them bodies corporate and politic; (c) both were created for the purpose of constructing improvements; (d) there is no express provision for either in the charter of the city and county of Denver; (e) both were created by acts of the general assembly. People ex rel. Stokes v. Newton, 106
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 61
       </cite>
       , 101 P.2d 21 (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal improvement will be considered for public use where it is open to use by all persons who have need of it.
       The use may be public though not many persons may enjoy it. The fact that persons using the improvement must pay for the privilege does not render it any the less a public use, providing all can use it on substantially the same terms. Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., 72
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 268
       </cite>
       , 211 P. 649 (1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, even if this law specifically directed that the tunnel be leased to the Moffat road for railroad purposes
       (a just rental based on the cost of constructing and maintaining the tunnel being provided), as the tunnel would be operated by the railroad as a public highway for the carriage of passengers and freight, it would be a public improvement for public use. The test of the public character of an improvement is the use to which it is to be put, not the person by whom it is operated. Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., 262 U.S. 710, 43 S. Ct. 694, 67 L. Ed. 1194 (1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any right that a lessee for use of the Moffat tunnel might have to condemn an easement or right-of-way pursuant to this section is inoperative and noneffective,
       as it would interfere with the independent judgment of the Moffat tunnel commission regarding the use of its property. Denver &amp; Rio Grande W. R. Co. v. Winter Park, 708 P.2d 1376 (Colo. App. 1985).

       The legislative intent in subsection (3)

       Therefore, payment of property tax as additional qualification for voting may no longer retain vitality.
       The election code utilizes different phrases, "taxpaying elector" and "qualified taxpaying elector", to describe situations in which payment of a property tax is an additional qualification for voting. Those phrases are not used in connection with general elections. Thus, although §

       purports to add payment of a property tax to the qualifications of voters in Moffat tunnel elections conducted during or after 1964, the provisions of the election code, read against the backdrop of a legislative policy of liberality, suggest that proviso no longer retains vitality.

       Subsection (3) does not deprive landowners within the district who failed to pay real estate taxes of equal protection

       The Election Code [arts. 1 through 17 of title 1] sets forth only the basic voter qualifications for all general, primary, and special elections, and there is no statutory provision which states that in special purpose elections, such as in subsection (3) of this section, an additional voter qualification cannot be imposed.

        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar09-s32-9-119.1ol11a">
         The district has been authorized to construct a transportation expansion plan adopted by the board and approved by the voters on November 2, 2004. The transportation expansion plan anticipates that construction will be completed on all fixed guideway corridors in a twelve-year period.
        </li>
        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar09-s32-9-119.1ol11b">
         The scheduling and timely performance of the transportation expansion plan partially depends on coordination with utility companies for the prompt performance of utility relocation work necessitated by construction of the transportation expansion plan.

         Increased coordination between the district and utility companies is in the public interest, and prompt performance of utility relocation work within the adopted plan schedule will reduce delays and costs of construction. Utility relocation work shall be undertaken in a manner that minimizes the relocation cost and the disruption of utility services.

In making such a determination, the utility company shall take into consideration the location of the utility facilities, complexity of the relocation, and timing of the need for relocation work.
         (2) (a) The district shall negotiate with any affected utility company in each fixed guideway corridor.

The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently, economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

Any interim notes may mature at such time not exceeding a period of time equal to the estimated time needed to effect the purposes for which the bonds are authorized to be issued, plus two years, as the board may determine. Except as otherwise provided in this section, interim notes shall be issued as provided in this article for district securities.

Any such bonds pledged as collateral security shall not be issued in an aggregate principal amount exceeding the aggregate principal amount of the interim notes or interim notes secured by a pledge of such bonds, nor shall they bear interest at any time which, with any interest accruing at the same time on the interim notes so secured, exceeds the maximum net effective interest rate authorized.

Any such bonds shall mature at such time as the board may determine, but in no event exceeding forty years from the date of either any of the interim notes so funded or any of the bonds so pledged as collateral security, whichever date is earlier.

         Certain areas in this state possess natural characteristics which make them attractive for the building of seasonal homes and tourist facilities. There is an increasing need to build public facilities in such areas in order to accommodate the needs of the seasonal population. Many of these areas contain large federal land holdings which attract seasonal users. The increasing public use in such areas is leading to serious water quality problems, a factor of concern to all the citizens of this state. Such an area is the three lakes area of Grand county, surrounding Grand lake, Shadow Mountain lake, and lake Granby. The general assembly thus declares that the creation of this district promotes the health, comfort, convenience, safety, and welfare of all the people of the state and visitors to the state, and will be of special benefit to the inhabitants of the district and the property therein.

         The experience of the Big Thompson flood of 1976 illustrates the need for Colorado floodplains to be continually kept clear of debris and debris-collecting structures. This need is most apparent in the urban drainage and flood control district which encompasses many different political entities and more than one-half of the entire population of this state. To meet this need, it is the intent of the general assembly that a systematic and uniform program of preventive maintenance be instituted and maintained in the district, which program shall be administered by the board of directors of the district and not by local governments.

       In any such case the board shall first pass a resolution setting forth that certain tracts therein described were omitted from such assessment, and notifying all persons who may desire to object thereto to appear at a meeting of the board at a time specified in such resolution to present their objection thereto and directing the engineer to report to the board at or prior to the date fixed for such hearing the amount which should be borne by each such tract so omitted, which resolution shall be published at least once by the secretary in a newspaper of general circulation in the improvement district and shall be thereby mailed to the last known owner of each such tract.

       Thereupon the assessment on such roll of each omitted tract shall be collected, the payment of which shall be secured by an assessment lien; and a claim of lien therefor may be filed for record in the office of the county clerk as other assessments, as provided in section  32-11-652.

      <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar11-s32-11-706ol11">
       The failure of any person in the urban district or in the area to be annexed to file a written objection to any proposed annexation in a hearing of the board thereon shall be taken as an assent on such person's part to the inclusion in the district of the area described in the notice of the hearing for annexation.

       The action of the board in its determination that any proposed annexation which it orders is feasible and to the best interests of the district shall be final, conclusive, and not subject to review.

       Whenever the board by resolution enters an order annexing any real property to the urban district, the secretary of the board shall forthwith file the resolution:

       If an order is so entered annexing real property to the urban district, such order is deemed final. The entry of such order finally and conclusively establishes the annexation of the real property to the district against all persons except the state, in a proceeding in the nature of quo warranto, commenced by the attorney general within thirty days after the resolution entering such order is filed with him or her and not otherwise. Such an annexation shall not be directly or collaterally questioned in any suit, action, or proceeding except as expressly authorized in this subsection (4).

       After the date of the annexation of such real property to the urban district by the adoption of such resolution, the annexed property shall be liable for its proportionate share of existing bonded indebtedness of the district; but such real property shall not be liable for any taxes or service charges levied or assessed prior to the inclusion of such annexed property in the district, nor shall the entry of the property into the district be made subject to or contingent upon the payment or assumption of any penalty, toll, or charge, other than the taxes and service charges which are uniformly made, assessed, or levied for the entire district except as otherwise expressly provided in this article.

       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the extension of the sales and use taxes imposed pursuant to section  32-13-105 are extensions of expiring taxes subject to the provisions of section 20 (4)(a) of article X of the state constitution and are subject to voter approval; that the tax proceeds resulting from the taxes which the voters may be asked to extend are subject to the fiscal year spending limit of the Denver metropolitan scientific and cultural facilities district imposed by section 20 (7)(b) of said article X; that said constitutional provision limits the growth of district revenues by restricting the increase of fiscal year spending to the rate of inflation plus annual local growth; that the ballot questions specified in section  32-13-105 fully disclose to the voters that the amount of tax proceeds resulting from the taxes which they may be asked to extend will be subject to increase after the current fiscal year based upon the factors of inflation and annual local growth specified in section 20 (7)(b) of said article X; and that this disclosure in said ballot questions is for informational purposes only as the growth in the amount of tax proceeds is permitted to occur only at the rate permitted by section 20 (7)(b) of said article X.

       The purpose of this article is to secure a dependable source of revenue to be used by the Denver metropolitan scientific and cultural facilities district to assist scientific and cultural facilities within said district as set forth in this article and to provide for a source of revenue which will grow in proportion to the expanding financial needs of scientific and cultural facilities. However, in the event that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction that the provisions of section 20 of article X of the state constitution do not permit an extension of an expiring tax which incorporates such growth in revenues, the portions of the ballot questions set forth in section  32-13-105 which provide for an adjustment of permissible revenues based on inflation and annual local growth shall be deemed to be severable from the remainder of such ballot questions and that the valid portions of the ballot questions are not so essentially and inseparably connected with or dependent upon the invalid portions that the valid portions would not have been enacted without the invalid portions.

      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that access to health-care services is an increasing problem in Colorado and that some Coloradans do not have access to a primary care provider. It is the intent of the general assembly to ease the strain on Coloradan's health-care needs by allowing a special district to be created to provide health-care services and facilities.

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11a">
         It is in the best interest of the state and its citizens and a public purpose to enable and encourage the owners of eligible real property to invest in new energy improvements, including energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy improvements, sooner rather than later by creating the Colorado new energy improvement district and authorizing the district to establish, develop, finance, implement, and administer a new energy improvement program that includes both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy improvements to assist any such owners who choose to join the district in completing new energy improvements to their property because:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aI">
           New energy improvements, including energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy improvements, help protect owners of eligible real property from the financial impact of the rising cost of electricity produced from nonrenewable fuels and can even provide positive cash flow in many instances in which the costs of the improvements are spread out over a long enough time so that the owners' utility bill cost savings exceed the special assessments levied on the eligible real property to pay for the improvements;
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aII">
           The inclusion of both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy improvements in the new energy improvement program will help to promote informed choices and maximize the benefits of the program for both individual owners of eligible real property and society as a whole;
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aIII">
           Reduction in the amount of emissions of greenhouse gases and environmental pollutants resulting from decreased use of traditional nonrenewable fuels will improve air quality and may help to mitigate climate change;
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aIV">
           New energy improvements, including energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy improvements, increase the value of the eligible real property improved;
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aV">
           The commitment of a significant amount of sustainable funding for increased construction of new energy improvements will create jobs and stimulate the state economy:
           <ol type="A">
            <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aVA">
             By directly creating jobs for contractors and other persons who complete new energy improvements; and
            </li>
            <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aVB">
             By reinforcing the leadership role of the state in the Colorado energy economy and thereby attracting new energy manufacturing facilities and related jobs to the state; and
            </li>
           </ol>
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11aVI">
           The new energy improvement program provides a meaningful, practical opportunity for average citizens to take action that will benefit their personal finances and the economy of the state, promote their own and the nation's energy independence and security, and help sustain the environment; and
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol11b">
         In many cases, the owner of eligible real property is unable to fund a new energy improvement because the owner does not have sufficient liquid assets to directly fund the improvement and is unable or unwilling to incur the negative net cash flow likely to result if the owner uses a typical home equity loan or line of credit or other loan to fund the improvement.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that it is necessary, appropriate, and legally permissible under section 20 of article X of the state constitution and all other constitutional provisions and laws to authorize the Colorado new energy improvement district, without voter approval in advance, to generate the capital needed to reimburse owners of eligible real property who voluntarily join the district for, or directly pay for all or a portion of the cost of, completing new energy improvements, including energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy improvements, to the property by levying special assessments and issuing special assessment bonds to be paid from the revenues generated by the special assessments because:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12a">
         Under the Colorado supreme court's decision in
    972 P.2d 1037 (Colo. 1998), the Colorado new energy improvement district is neither the state nor a local government and therefore is not a district, as defined in section 20 (2)(b) of article X of the state constitution, subject to the requirements of section 20 of article X of the state constitution because:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12aI">
           The district is not authorized to levy general taxes;
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12aII">
           Although the district is a public corporation that serves the public purposes of promoting new energy improvements and creating jobs, it does not have elected board members and primarily exists to serve the interests of owners of eligible real property who voluntarily join the district in order to fund new energy improvements to the property; and
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12aIII">
           The district is endowed by the state pursuant to this article with only the powers necessary to perform its predominantly private objective;
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12b">
         There is no legal impediment to the imposition of special assessments and the issuance of special assessment bonds without an election by an entity like the Colorado new energy improvement district that is formed by law, has statewide jurisdiction, and is governed by an appointed board;
        </li>
        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12c">
         The burden of a special assessment is voluntarily assumed by the owner of the eligible real property on which the special assessment is levied because:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12cI">
           A special assessment may only be levied on eligible real property if the owner of the property has voluntarily joined the district, agreed to accept reimbursement or a direct payment, and consented to the levy of a special assessment; and
          </li>
          <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12cII">
           A subsequent purchaser of eligible real property upon which a special assessment has been levied purchases the property with full knowledge of the special assessment; and
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t32-specialstatutorydistricts-ar20-s32-20-102ol12d">
         Both an owner of eligible real property who joins the district and receives reimbursement or a direct payment and any subsequent owner of the property receive the special benefit of the new energy improvement for which the district has made reimbursement or a direct payment in proportion to or in excess of the amount of the special assessment paid.

     <p>
      With the approval of each county or municipality having jurisdiction over the area of such a district, the district may establish a station area improvement district to finance the construction, operation, or maintenance of a station for a passenger rail system. A station area improvement district may consist only of all or a portion of the area within a two-mile radius of the station to be funded by the station area improvement district, and the general assembly finds that the area within a two-mile radius of a passenger rail station, or any portion of such an area that the board may designate as a station area improvement district, is an area that will be especially benefited by the construction, operation, or maintenance of such a station. The board shall not establish a station area improvement district unless it receives a petition signed by the owners of property that will bear a majority of the proposed assessments and by a petition signed by the lesser of a majority of the registered electorate in the proposed station area improvement district or one thousand registered electors in the proposed station area improvement district. The method of creating a station area improvement district, making improvements, assessing the costs of improvements made against property, and levying a sales tax shall be as provided in part 6 of article 20 of title 30; except that the board shall perform the duties of the board of county commissioners under said part 6 and the improvements shall be limited to the construction, operation, or maintenance of a passenger rail station.
