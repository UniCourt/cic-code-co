                        There is hereby created in the state treasury the agriculture management fund. The fund shall consist of money transferred pursuant to section 38-13-801.5 (3), any money realized from the sale of the inspection and consumer services division facility

                        Road, Denver, Colorado. The department shall use such money to fund agricultural efforts approved by the commissioner, including, but not limited to, funding additional department employees necessary to implement and manage approved
                        programs. Money may be used for direct assistance or grant assistance for conservation districts created pursuant to article 70 of this title 35. Money in the fund may be used for expenses related to the department's office consolidation
                        as authorized by House Bill 13-1234, enacted in 2013, and as authorized by House Bill 16-1460, enacted in 2016. Money in the fund is subject to annual appropriation to the department. Any money not expended or encumbered from any
                        appropriation at the end of any fiscal year shall remain available for expenditure in the next fiscal year without further appropriation. All interest derived from the deposit and investment of money in the fund shall be credited
                        to the fund and shall not be transferred or credited to the general fund or any other fund.

                    It is the declared policy of the state of Colorado to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land for the production of food and other agricultural products. The general assembly recognizes that, when nonagricultural
                    land uses extend into agricultural areas, agricultural operations often become the subject of nuisance suits. As a result, a number of agricultural operations are forced to cease operations, and many others are discouraged from making
                    investments in farm improvements. It is the purpose of this article to reduce the loss to the state of Colorado of its agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance.
                    It is further recognized that units of local government may adopt ordinances or pass resolutions that provide additional protection for agricultural operations consistent with the interests of the affected agricultural community, without
                    diminishing the rights of any real property interests.

        The mere fact that an operator moves an agricultural sprinkler on a county road
       </b> does not establish a public nuisance. Moreover, even if the use of the agricultural sprinkler constituted a public nuisance, the county is empowered only to abate the nuisance to the extent reasonably necessary and,

                        The general assembly hereby finds and declares that there is a need to prevent the introduction into Colorado and the dissemination within this state of plant pests through the movement of plant products and other plant material. This act provides for
                        the regulation of the movement of plant products, materials, and pests in Colorado and establishes provisions under which such plant products and materials may legally enter or leave the state. This act also provides for the establishment
                        of interstate and intrastate quarantines to restrict the movement of plant products, materials, and pests. To this end, the commissioner of agriculture is hereby directed and authorized to control and prevent, by such means as
                        shall be prescribed and provided by law, rule, or order of the commissioner, all contagious, infectious, and plant pests destructive to the state's agricultural, forestry, or horticultural interests or to the state's general environmental

                        a present threat to the continued economic and environmental value of the lands of the state and if present in any area of the state must be managed. It is the intent of the general assembly that the advisory commissions appointed

                    Whereas, in many large areas of this state certain destructive rodent pests, such as jackrabbits, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, pocket gophers, and rats, have become so numerous and such a grave and immediate menace to the agricultural, horticultural,
                    and livestock industries of the state that large numbers of the inhabitants engaged in such industries in the localities so infested are in great and imminent danger of being impoverished and reduced to want by the destruction of their
                    crops; and, whereas, the situation is so serious and the emergency so urgent that public necessity demands that prompt, efficacious, and summary action be taken under the police power of the state to control, suppress, and eradicate
                    the rodents in the areas infested by them; now, therefore, it is declared that in all fields, orchards, places, localities, and areas in the state infested with any such rodents in sufficient numbers as to materially injure agricultural
                    or horticultural crops therein, such infestation is a public nuisance and subject to suppression and abatement as such under the provisions of this part 1.

                    The general assembly hereby finds and declares that pesticides perform a valuable function in controlling insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be injurious to crops, livestock, and other desirable forms of plant and animal life,
                    to structures, and to individuals. The general assembly further finds and declares that pesticides contain toxic substances which may pose a serious risk to the public health and safety and that regulation of pesticide use is necessary
                    to prevent adverse effects on individuals and the environment.

                        The purpose of this article is to provide the means whereby producers, shippers, carriers, buyers, and sellers of fruits, vegetables, and such other agricultural products as may be mutually agreed upon, on application, may secure prompt and efficient
                        inspection and classification of such products. The standardization of the produce industry by means of the proper classification and grading of fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products is recognized to be beneficial
                        to the producer, carrier, shipper, buyer, seller, and consumer. Prompt and efficient inspection, under competent authority, furnishes the producer and the shipper prima facie evidence of quality and condition of products; it guarantees
                        the carrier and the receiver as to the quality and condition of products carried and received by them; and it assures the ultimate consumer of the quality and condition of products purchased.

                        The commissioner is empowered to establish and enforce such grades, grading rules, and regulations in addition to those established by this article, in no event less than the minimum requirements prescribed by this article, as he may deem necessary on
                        fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products, which shall not conflict with any provisions of this article, after a thorough investigation has been made of the needs of the particular fruit, vegetable, or other agricultural
                        product for which grades, grading rules, and regulations are contemplated; but, whenever it is deemed advisable by the commissioner, such grades shall be the same as the grades promulgated by the United States department of agriculture.
                        Such grades, grading rules, and regulations, before they become effective, shall be submitted for approval at one or more public meetings called for that purpose and attended by representative growers and shippers of the localities
                        interested in the industry affected. Such meetings shall be advertised at least once in a newspaper published in such localities, one week or more prior to the meeting. Said meeting shall be presided over by the commissioner or
                        any of his duly authorized deputies and, insofar as possible and practicable, shall be conducted at such places as can be conveniently reached by representatives of the affected industry. Grades, grading rules, and regulations,
                        established in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall not be modified during the current shipping season of the fruit, vegetable, or other agricultural product for which they are established. In like manner the commissioner
                        may provide for standard packages for all fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products, but no standard packages shall be eliminated or changed without two years' notice to the industry involved.

                    shall not be required to plead or prove irreparable injury or the inadequacy of the remedy at law. Under no circumstances shall the court require the commissioner to post a bond.

                <p>
                    The general assembly hereby finds and declares that truth in the labeling of seed is of paramount importance to the citizens of Colorado because the distribution and subsequent use of poor quality seed caused by inaccurate or misleading labeling of such
                    seed can result in severe economic hardship due to low crop yields, poor crop quality, and the spread of noxious weed seed. It is the intent of the general assembly in enacting this article to prevent the distribution and use of poor
                    quality seed through the regulation of the labeling, the labelers, and the sellers of seed for propagation in Colorado.

                            It is declared that the marketing of agricultural commodities in Colorado, in excess of reasonable and normal market demand therefor; disorderly marketing of such commodities; improper preparation for market and lack of uniform grading and classification
                            of agricultural commodities; unfair methods of competition in the marketing of such commodities; and the inability of individual producers to develop new and larger markets for Colorado grown agricultural commodities, result
                            in an unreasonable and unnecessary economic waste of the agricultural wealth of this state. Such conditions and the accompanying waste jeopardize the future continued production of adequate food supplies for the people of this
                            and other states, and prevent agricultural producers from obtaining a fair return from their labor, their farms, and the agricultural commodities which they produce. As a consequence, the purchasing power of such producers
                            has been in the past, and may continue to be in the future, unless such conditions are remedied, low in relation to that of persons engaged in other gainful occupations. Colorado agricultural producers are thereby prevented
                            from maintaining a proper standard of living and from contributing their fair share to the support of the necessary governmental and educational functions, thus tending to increase unfairly the tax burdens of other citizens
                            of this state.

                            commodities, to develop more efficient and equitable methods in the marketing of agricultural commodities, and to aid agricultural producers in restoring and maintaining their purchasing power at a more adequate, equitable,

                            Marketing order not violative of federal antitrust laws. A milk marketing order which provides for the posting of prices, discounts, and rebates by handlers and distributors, but does not specify what those prices should be, nor requires that all handlers
                            and distributors post the same prices, which allows for the changing of prices after notice and to meet unregulated competition, plus requires that prices be uniform and without discrimination between customers, in no way involves
                            the fixing of prices, nor is a conflict with the federal antitrust laws or the commerce and supremacy clauses of the United States Constitution. Shoenberg Farms, Inc. v. People ex rel. Swisher, 166

                            Any moneys remaining in such fund, allocable to any particular agricultural commodity affected by a marketing order, at the discretion of the commissioner, may be refunded at the close of any marketing season, upon a pro rata basis, to all persons from
                            whom assessments were collected, or such portion of such moneys as may be recommended by the board of control and approved by the commissioner may be carried over into the next succeeding marketing season whenever the commissioner
                            finds that such moneys may be required to assist in defraying the cost of operating such marketing order in such succeeding season. Upon termination by the commissioner of any marketing order, any moneys remaining, and not
                            required by the commissioner to defray the expenses of such marketing order, shall be returned by the commissioner, upon a pro rata basis, to all persons from whom assessments were collected. If the commissioner finds that
                            the amounts so returnable are so small as to make impractical the computation and remitting of such pro rata refund to such persons, the commissioner may use the moneys in such fund to defray the expenses incurred by him in
                            the formulation, issuance, administration, or enforcement of any subsequent marketing order for such commodity.

                            Only when commissioner files claim for collection may assessment be contested. After the agriculture commissioner has determined the amount of the assessment and called for collection, if payment is not forthcoming, then the commissioner may file a claim
                            for collection of the assessment. It is at such time that the taxpayers have a full and complete opportunity to challenge the assessment. Until the commissioner makes a determination of the amount of the assessment, the judiciary
                            has no jurisdiction to interfere where the commissioner is merely exercising his statutory duties. People ex rel. Orcutt v. District Court, 167

                    The purposes of this article are to provide a means whereby the general public purchasing certain Colorado agricultural products may be assured of the quality and grade of such products; to assure Colorado producers a better return from the sale of higher
                    quality products; to establish a method of labeling and identification of such Colorado products so that purchasers may easily recognize them; to set up standards for quality, condition, packaging, and distribution of Colorado agricultural
                    products so that the highest quality will be maintained until the product reaches the consumer; and to extend in every practicable way the production and sale of higher quality Colorado-produced agricultural products.

                    The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that Colorado has a substantial interest in promoting the development of a viable and stable wine industry in this state. The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that grape
                    cultivation is closely related to fruit cultivation carried out in various parts of Colorado; that grape cultivation and wine production are a logical supplement to, and development of, existing agricultural business conducted in the
                    state; that wine production has become a significant industry in other states because of the action of state and local governments in those areas to foster development of the industry; that a viable wine industry can enhance Colorado's
                    tourist industry; that some aspects of wine industry development can best be accomplished by an industry-wide approach rather than by individual producers, such as conducting scientific research and disseminating and publishing the
                    results of such research, promoting Colorado wines as distinct from those produced in other regions, and promoting awareness of responsible consumption of wine; and that the state should aid Colorado's wine industry through research
                    and promotion to allow the industry to realize its full potential in this state.

                    The general assembly declares that the purpose of this article is to regulate the slaughter and processing of certain animals intended for human consumption. The general assembly finds that the production, processing, and consumption of meat animals plays
                    an important part in the economy of this state and that to maintain the integrity of this industry and to protect the public health and welfare it is essential that the slaughter and processing of these animals occur in a safe, sanitary,
                    and nondeceptive manner. It is therefore necessary to provide for the regulation of the slaughter and processing of meat animals.

       </b> The case annotated below was decided under CSA, C. 15, § 12(1), the subject matter of which was similar to this section, even though the definition of "cash buyer" was not included in the 1985 recodification.

                    <p>
                        The act of 1937, the origin of this article, enlarged the type of person brought under it, namely, dealers as well as commission merchants, brokers, and agents. Zeigler v. People, 109

                    <p>
                        The act of 1937 also added livestock and livestock products in its classification of farm produce coming under the subject matter of the act. Zeigler v. People, 109
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 252

                    <p>
                        It also added and defined the term, "cash buyer". Zeigler v. People, 109
                        <cite class="co_code">

                    <p>
                        The definition of cash buyer does not include a person who pays by check. Zeigler v. People, 109
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 252
       </cite> , 124 P.2d 593 (1942).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition itself does not include payment by check, and the history of the development of the act indicates a definite intent to exclude payment by check. Zeigler v. People, 109
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 252

                    <p>
                        The omission of the words "or its equivalent" after "lawful money of the United States" in the 1937 act would indicate a definite legislative intent to narrow the term cash buyer to one who actually pays for farm produce solely in lawful money of the
                        United States or by exchange of farm products. Zeigler v. People, 109

                        Defendant obtained possession of the victims' commodities by purporting to act as a licensed commodity handler; then, as defendant admitted at his restitution hearing, he used the proceeds from the sale of the seed to repay his own creditors rather than
                        pay the victims. Limiting the victims' restitution to the amount of the bond that defendant failed to post would not take account of the full scope of the criminal conduct to which defendant pleaded guilty. People v. Leonard, 167

        The reasonable expectation that a person engaged in a licensed occupation is properly licensed
       </b> and that transactions with the person, therefore, will be subject to the various protections that come with governmental regulation establishes proximate cause for purposes of the restitution statute. People v. Leonard,

                        Defendant obtained possession of the victims' commodities by purporting to act as a licensed commodity handler; then, as defendant admitted at his restitution hearing, he used the proceeds from the sale of the seed to repay his own creditors rather than
                        pay the victims. Limiting the victims' restitution to the amount of the bond that defendant failed to post would not take account of the full scope of the criminal conduct to which defendant pleaded guilty. People v. Leonard, 167

                <p>
                    The commissioner, after hearing and after consideration of both the needs and concerns involved, shall adopt a permit system incorporating the policies and procedures developed by the commissioner in cooperation with the division of parks and wildlife,
                    pursuant to which annual permits shall be issued for the use of poisons by livestock operators, owners, or their authorized agents, for the control of predatory animals on lands owned or leased by them from private parties, if the
                    point of use is at least two hundred yards from the nearest property line or public right-of-way. Such permit system shall, as practicably and reasonably as possible, provide a balance between the need to control predators and the
                    need for protection for human beings and other forms of life. Such permit system shall specify the type of information to be set forth in the application, including the substance or device to be used, the quantity thereof, and identification
                    of the property where the use is desired. The permit shall similarly set forth such information and shall also set forth such instructions, conditions, and restrictions as may be appropriate in the circumstances, including posting
                    of public notice that poisons are in use.

                        ascertain, in addition to the regular assessment for taxation purposes, all cattle which will be one year old or over as of February 1 within the county in any year in which the program is in effect, and shall keep such information

                        received. It is the responsibility of the Colorado sheep and wool board to provide the county assessor, by October 1 of each year, with a list containing the names and addresses of such sheep owners in the county and the number
                        of sheep marketed during the immediately preceding twelve months. Such information shall be transmitted by the county assessor to the board of county commissioners by November 1 of each year. The board of county commissioners also

                        against all such sheep or cattle, or both, and shall adjust the fee on cattle on the basis of the number of months any cattle will be herded or grazed in the county, and shall adjust the fee on sheep on the basis of the number
                        of months the sheep were herded or grazed in the county during the previous year.

                            represent as nearly as possible all sections of the state wherein livestock is a major activity, but at no time shall any two members be residents of the same particular section of the state. The term of office of said commissioners

                        For a search warrant to be valid under both the United States and state constitutions, a warrant must meet three requirements: (1) It must have been issued by a neutral, disinterested magistrate; (2) those seeking the warrant must have demonstrated to
                        the magistrate their probable cause to believe that the evidence sought would aid in a particular apprehension or conviction for a particular offense; and (3) the warrant must particularly describe the things to be seized as well
                        as the place to be searched. People v. Harris,

                        Ample evidence of defendants' mistreatment and neglect of cattle supported trial court's decision to permanently enjoin defendants from owning, managing, controlling, or otherwise possessing livestock. The permanent injunction was not overly broad in
                        light of the undisputed facts. Nor did the injunction violate defendants' due process rights under the state constitution and the United States constitution because the injunction served the legitimate public interest of protecting

                    a licensed veterinarian is not available, the animal may be euthanized if, by the written certificate of two persons, one of whom may be selected by the owner if the owner so requests, called to view the animal in the presence of the
                    agent, the animal appears to be severely injured past recovery, severely disabled past recovery, severely diseased past recovery, or unfit for any useful purpose.

                        Ample evidence of defendants' mistreatment and neglect of cattle supported trial court's decision to permanently enjoin defendants from owning, managing, controlling, or otherwise possessing livestock. The permanent injunction was not overly broad in
                        light of the undisputed facts. Nor did the injunction violate defendants' due process rights under the state constitution and the United States constitution because the injunction served the legitimate public interest of protecting
                        livestock from mistreatment and neglect. Stulp v. Schuman,

                                        gives such owner notice regarding the taking and impounding of such animal and an opportunity to reclaim such animal. Such reasonable effort shall include contacting the owner if the dog or cat is wearing an identification
                                        tag. (1) (a) (I) As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, an animal "shelter or pound" means a nonprofit private or publicly owned facility where stray, abandoned, lost, or unwanted pet animals

                    or sheep which may be driven into or through any county of this state shall be plainly branded or marked with one uniform brand or mark. The cattle shall be so branded with the distinguishing ranch or road brand of the owner as to
                    show distinctly in such places as the owner may adopt. Sheep shall be marked distinctly with such mark or device as may be sufficient to distinguish the same readily, should they become intermixed with other flocks of sheep owned in
                    the state. Any such owner or person in charge of such drove being driven into or through the state who fails to comply with the provisions of this article shall be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than three hundred dollars.

                        In a prosecution for violation of this section, an instruction which would require the people to prove a demand by some person to see the hide of the animal would be erroneous, since the section makes it unlawful for the seller of the carcass to offer
                        the meat for sale without "first exhibiting" the hide. Eachus v. People, 124

                        that defendant had failed to preserve the hide of the beef for a period of 30 days and, further, that the defendant had failed to exhibit the same for inspection of any person within said period of 30 days, places an undue burden
                        upon the prosecution and is to the great benefit and advantage of defendant. Eachus v. People, 124

                    state board of stock inspection commissioners in Denver or notify the nearest authorized brand inspector. Any person having knowledge of any estray animal upon the public range may notify the state board of stock inspection commissioners,

                    When any person takes into his custody any estray animal and sends a description of the same to the state board of stock inspection commissioners, said person shall be entitled to hold same lawfully until relieved of its custody by the state board of
                    stock inspection commissioners. Should a claimant for said animal apply to the person who has custody of the estray for possession of the same, the said person shall at once notify the state board of stock inspection commissioners
                    in writing of such application, and should the said board be satisfied that said applicant is the rightful owner, it shall forthwith issue an order authorizing said person in custody to deliver the estray to the owner, who may be required
                    to pay any reasonable charges made by said person in custody. In case of a controversy as to what constitutes a reasonable charge, the state board of stock inspection commissioners shall fix the amount. The time of service for which
                    said person may claim remuneration commences upon the date of notification made by the said person to the state board of stock inspection commissioners.

                    or herding certain kind of livestock on any such range over the protest of others in prior use and occupancy thereof, who graze a different kind of livestock, will not confer a better right.

                    the clerk of the court to give notice of the establishment of such range, which notice shall describe the area or boundaries of the range involved, pursuant to the terms of the decree, and state in substance the findings of the court.
                    Three copies of said notice shall be posted at conspicuous places upon said range by the sheriff of the county in which said range is situated and return made to the clerk of said court, and thereafter it is unlawful for any person,
                    whether acting in the person's own behalf or as the agent, servant, or employee of another, to graze or herd stock not entitled to be herded or grazed thereon. Each such person violating this article 45 commits a petty offense. Each
                    day that any such person violates this article 45 constitutes a separate offense.

                        Occasional grazing during drive does not violate injunction from grazing. Where the owner of sheep is enjoined from grazing them on designated cattle range, he may rightfully drive them across the latter to reach land held by him under lease if he does
                        so in good faith; occasional grazing while the sheep are being driven or during temporary stops for needed rest will not constitute a violation of the injunction. Wyman v. Bell, 96

        Colorado's fencing laws are inapplicable to federal lands because Colorado law conflicts with the federal Taylor Grazing Act.
       </b> Under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, federal law overrides conflicting state law with respect to federal public lands. Management of the federal public lands should not be at the mercy of state legislatures.
                        Federal law as expressed in the Taylor Grazing Act prohibits grazing trespass on federal land with a permit. There is no obligation under the Act for the federal bureau of land management to fence out potential trespassers. United

                        Maintenance of lawful fence essential to recovery. Under this section, the owner of livestock turning the same at large upon the public highway is not liable for their invasion of the private lands of another who fails to maintain a lawful fence, nor
                        for their trespasses therein, even though he expects that such trespasses shall be committed. Richards v. Sanderson, 39

                        Fence law protects special district from willful trespass onto its property. The fence law modifies the common law of the state by adding a condition precedent to the recovery of damages in certain actions asserting non-willful trespass. This condition
                        precedent, the lawful fence requirement, may be raised as a defense by livestock owners, but it does not apply in actions for willful trespass or in trespass actions brought under subsections (2) and (3). Aspen Springs Metro. Dist.

                <p>
                    When any person is trespassed upon or damaged by any livestock or takes into his custody any livestock under section 35-46-102, the claim for damages occasioned by said livestock may be arbitrated by a board of three arbitrators, at the option of the
                    party aggrieved selecting one, the owner of the livestock selecting a second, and the two thus chosen selecting a third. Said arbitrators so chosen shall meet and act as a board of arbitration within five days after a written application
                    is made therefor by either party and written notice given to the other party. It is the duty of the person so taking into custody such livestock to notify in writing within five days after the taking into custody thereof the owner
                    or person in charge of such livestock. If the owner or person in charge of such livestock is not known to the person taking the livestock into custody or cannot be found after diligent search and inquiry, then the person so taking
                    custody of such livestock shall publish within one week a notice containing a full description of such livestock, including all marks and brands as nearly as can be ascertained, in a paper published nearest the place where the alleged
                    damage occurred. In the event the owner of such livestock cannot be found within ten days after the date of the publication of such notice, the livestock shall be an estray and the state board of stock inspection commissioners shall
                    be entitled to said livestock subject to the lien for damage sustained and cost and care and feeding of the same by the person taking such livestock into custody. Such person shall deliver the same to the owner thereof whenever such
                    owner furnishes the person so damaged by such livestock a bond in double the amount of the damage claimed, executed by two responsible persons, said bond to be satisfactory to such damaged party or approved by a county judge or district
                    judge of such county, conditioned upon the payment to the person taking custody of such livestock all damages and costs, if any such damages or costs are awarded.

                    in said arbitration shall follow the findings as in suits at court. If the owner of any livestock makes a tender in money of all damages to the person claiming damages, the person claiming damages shall pay all costs and expenses thereafter
                    accruing unless he is awarded a larger amount than was tendered by the owner of such livestock.

                    may proceed to erect or repair the entire partition fence and collect by a civil action at law one-half the entire cost thereof from the other owner. Any judgment obtained against the owner of any land for the value of his share of
                    any such partition fence or the repair thereof shall be a lien upon such owner's land to which such fence is appurtenant, and a special execution may issue and be levied upon the land to which such fence is appurtenant as in the manner

       35-47-102. Duty of custodian - fees - recovery.

                <p>
                    Where said animals are in violation of section 35-47-101, it is the duty of every sheriff or other peace officer of the county, on complaint of any person, to take custody of such animals and place them on feed and water. He may appoint a custodian for
                    such purpose and pay such custodian a fee of four dollars per day to be assessed as costs; and the owner or agent may give the sheriff or other officer a redelivery bond in sufficient sum for repossession of his stock, pending a court
                    action. In cases where the owner or agent is known and has been convicted in court, the sheriff or other officer may dispose of such animals or sufficient numbers of them to pay for the fine and reasonable costs of feeding and other
                    expenses in connection therewith, after giving ten days notice by posting three notices in public and conspicuous places. In cases where the owner of such animals is unknown, the animals shall be taken up and disposed of by the state
                    board of stock inspection commissioners, or one of its duly authorized representatives, the same as other estrays as provided for by law.

                    to any vested water right or to an adjudicated appropriation of water pursuant to state laws. Unless built upon an intermittent or perennial main stream, dams creating such livestock water tanks shall be deemed to have a rebuttable
                    presumption that there is no injury to adjudicated water rights when built pursuant to the specifications set forth in section 35-49-103. If used solely for watering of livestock in areas known to be deficient in windmill water, having
                    a pumping capacity of less than five gallons per minute, dams of greater capacity than those designated in section 35-49-103 may be constructed on any ephemeral stream, but in such event, the state engineer may require the construction
                    of drainage facilities to reduce the water impounded in the reservoir to the capacity prescribed in section 35-49-103, within a thirty-six hour period.

                    provide in writing approval of such structure. Approval shall be granted by the state engineer upon reasonable compliance with the approved application and standard specifications. A livestock water tank shall not be disapproved because
                    of failure to observe technical engineering details in construction.

                        35-41-104 on all livestock inspected. In addition, the board is authorized to levy and collect through authorized brand inspectors a minimum fee of not less than the amount specified in section 35-41-104 from each person, company,
                        or corporation requesting the brand inspection or from whom a brand inspection is required by law. The inspection fee established pursuant to this subsection (1), but not the minimum fee, shall apply when branded or unbranded cattle,

                        by law, that are offered for sale or to be moved interstate or intrastate and collect the inspection fee and minimum fee thereon. Within the limits prescribed by this subsection (1), the state board of stock inspection commissioners
                        shall determine the amount of the inspection fee and minimum fee that shall be collected by authorized brand inspectors from the owner or person in charge of said cattle, horses, or mules before issuing a certificate of brand inspection

                    consignor thereof, to hold the proceeds received from the sale of said livestock for a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days, to permit the consignor to establish ownership and if at expiration of that time, the consignor fails
                    to establish his lawful ownership of such livestock, said proceeds shall be released by such operator to the state board of stock inspection commissioners, which board has authority to dispose of said proceeds in accordance with Colorado's

                        The commissioner has full authority to administer oaths and take statements; to issue administrative subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses before the commissioner and for the production of all books, memoranda, papers and other documents, articles,
                        or instruments; and to compel the disclosure by such witnesses of all facts known to them relative to the matters under investigation. Upon the failure or refusal of any witness to obey an administrative subpoena, the commissioner
                        may petition the district court, and, upon a proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey such an order of the court is punishable as
                        contempt of court.

                    The general assembly finds and declares that the state of Colorado, through wind and water erosion and depletion of subsurface water resources, has lost for agricultural and livestock uses approximately six million acres, or one-tenth of the total area
                    of the state; that these losses range from severe damage to complete destruction of the topsoils of these areas; that these losses have been caused by improper farm and range practices, by increasing the rate of withdrawal from underground
                    water reserves without adequate attention to recharging such reserves, and by failure to conserve to the full the precious rainfall and snowpacks that could help replenish underground water reserves, and that the areas of land thus
                    destroyed will increase until and unless a constructive method of land use providing for the conservation and preservation of natural resources, including adequate underground water reserves, the control of wind and water erosion,
                    and the reduction of damage resulting from floods, is established by law over the entire state. It is to accomplish this purpose and to insure the health, prosperity, and welfare of the state of Colorado and its people that this article
                    is created, and it shall be construed liberally in order that the purposes expressed in this article may be accomplished.

                    Within sixty days after the holding of such election, if more than a majority of the votes cast are for organization of such proposed district, the state board shall certify to the division of local government in the department of local affairs a statement
                    of such election and the result thereof, together with a map or plat showing the area included within such district. The director of said division shall thereupon execute and deliver to the state board a certificate declaring the area
                    within the boundaries of such district to be a lawful conservation district under its name as shown in the records, and thereafter such district shall be a public body corporate and a political subdivision of the state of Colorado
                    and shall have all the powers and duties imposed upon such districts under the provisions of this article. Because the district is a political subdivision of the state, the property of such district, both real and personal, shall be

                        This article 77 is adopted by the general assembly with the intention that the commissioner will implement and enforce 21 CFR 112, concerning produce safety, under a cooperative agreement with the FDA, and in lieu of federal enforcement by the FDA. The
                        commissioner may seek to enter into a cooperative agreement with the FDA whereby the commissioner will assume enforcement authority and receive funding from the FDA. The first agreement should extend for five years. If the agreement
                        is not renewed for a second or subsequent period, the commissioner will cease implementing and enforcing this article 77.

                            Any pet animal held by or in the custody of a licensed animal shelter, whether public or private, and not reclaimed by the owner shall be held by the animal shelter for a minimum of five days after acquisition by the animal shelter before it may become
                            available for adoption or otherwise disposed of at the discretion of the animal shelter; except that a shelter supervisor may determine that a pet animal without identification, including but not limited to a microchip or collar,
                            may be disposed of in three days if such shelter supervisor determines the shelter has no additional resources for such pet animal or determines that such pet animal is dangerous. For purposes of this section, "days" means
                            days during which the shelter is open to the public. If the animal shelter acquires the pet animal from the owner or an authorized representative of the owner, the pet animal becomes the property of the animal shelter at the
                            time of transfer of the pet animal, and the pet animal may be disposed of by and at the discretion of the animal shelter. If the pet animal is abandoned, as defined in section 18-9-201 (1), C.R.S., the pet animal becomes the
                            property of the animal shelter upon acquisition and may be disposed of by and at the discretion of the animal shelter. The animal shelter shall be the steward of stray animals for the purposes of providing prophylactic veterinary
                            care under the written protocol and direction of the shelter veterinarian. Pet animals, which in the opinion of a veterinarian or the animal shelter supervisor, if a veterinarian is not available, are experiencing extreme pain
                            or suffering, may be disposed of immediately by the animal shelter through euthanasia after the animal shelter has exhausted reasonable efforts to contact the owner; however, for pet animals with identification, the animal
                            shelter shall exhaust reasonable efforts to contact the owner for up to twenty-four hours.
