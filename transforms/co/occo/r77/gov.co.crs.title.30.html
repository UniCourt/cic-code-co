       <p>
        Section 15 of art. XIV, Colo. Const., empowers the general assembly to classify counties according to population
        for the purpose of fixing fees. Frost v. Pfeiffer, 26
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 338
        </cite>
        , 58 P. 147 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assumed to be classified by population.
        The assignment of a new county by the act creating it to a certain class for the purpose of fixing the fees of its officers is not special legislation in the meaning of the constitution, and it will be assumed that the general assembly classified the county according to its population. Frost v. Pfeiffer, 26
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 338
        </cite>
        , 58 P. 147 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        By the Session Laws of 1891 all the counties of the state were divided into five classes,
        according to population as ascertained by the federal census of the year 1890, and the fees prescribed under each class are different from the fees under any of the others, and a material reduction in the amount of charges was made from that which theretofore prevailed. Airy v. People, 21
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 144

        Only statutory fees collected.
        Since the compensation of any public official for services rendered in his official capacity is regulated by statute, he is entitled only to demand and receive fees for those services concerning which compensation by law attaches, because it is an inflexible rule that an official can demand only such fees or compensation as the law has definitely fixed and authorized for the performance of his official duties. Adams-Arapahoe County Sch. Dist. No. 28J v. Wolf, 30
        <cite class="cocode">

       <p>
        Fees enter fund from which treasurer is compensated.
        The fees and commissions are to be collected by the treasurer, not as his compensation for the particular work for which the fee may be prescribed, but for the purpose of creating a fund out of which his salary or compensation is to be paid. The annual salary is what the treasurer gets for all the work that he does, it is compensation for his services. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Otero Irrigation Dist., 56
        <cite class="co_code">

       <p>
        The word "collect"
        is used to define the power of the county treasurers to gather in or receive money for taxes theretofore assessed, and since the fees provided for in this section are charged upon "all moneys received" by the treasurer, they fall within the above definition and are fees charged for the collection of taxes and are therefore collection fees.

        Commission on collection of irrigation district taxes.
        The moneys collected by the county treasurer for irrigation district taxes, whether the district was in one or more counties, came clearly within the description of money upon which the county treasurer by virtue of this section was required to charge and receive a commission.

        Moneys on account of redemptions from tax sales exempt.
        The commission of one percent allowed by this section does not apply to moneys paid on account of redemptions from tax sales, but is intended to apply to moneys received by the treasurer on account of licenses, and from other sources of revenue. Mitchell v. Wheeler, 20 Colo. App. 159, 77 P. 361 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        As is entry of assignment of certificate of purchase.
        This section did not authorize the treasurer to charge any fee whatever for entering on his books an assignment of a certificate of purchase, or for making any charge against a party who was entitled to redemption money on account of such assignment. Mitchell v. Wheeler, 20 Colo. App. 159, 77 P. 361 (1904).

       <p>
        And public school foundation taxes.
        A county treasurer does not have the right and duty to charge and receive a fee of one percent on taxes paid into his office pursuant to levies made by school districts under the terms of the "Public School Foundation Act of 1969". Adams-Arapahoe County Sch. Dist. No. 28J v. Wolf, 30

       <p>
        The county clerk's compensation for official acts is regulated by this section,
        and he is only entitled to charge for those services to which compensation by law attaches, for the rule is inflexible, that an official can only demand such fees or compensation as the law has fixed and authorized for the performance of his official duties. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Leonard, 26
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 145
        </cite>
        , 57 P. 693 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Duties separately defined.
        By this section the charges for recording instruments, making abstracts of title, making copies of records, making tax lists, serving as clerk of the board of county commissioners, and for the performance of other services required of the clerk, are separately defined. Henderson v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 4 Colo. App. 301, 35 P. 880 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Per diem is unconscionable salary.
        The sum allowed by law per diem to the county clerk for his services as clerk of the board of commissioners is a fee within the meaning of the salary act, and it is payable to him absolutely, and the board is without authority to annex to its payment any condition whatever. Henderson v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 4 Colo. App. 301, 35 P. 880 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        For required clerical duties.
        A county clerk, in his capacity as clerk of the board of county commissioners, is required to perform all services clerical in their nature, in connection with matters within the scope of the authority of the board, which are necessary to enable it to perform its duties with respect to such matters, and he is not entitled to fees for such services outside of his compensation as clerk of the board. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Leonard, 26
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 145
        </cite>
        , 57 P. 693 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        No compensation for services as to matters outside board's authority.
        A county clerk as clerk of the board of county commissioners is not entitled to compensation for services in relation to matters over which the board attempted to exercise a control, but which were not within the legitimate scope of its authority. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Leonard, 26
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 145
        </cite>
        , 57 P. 693 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        No fee is provided for the clerk for signing or attesting county warrants.
        Such work falls within that class of services for which, under the act of 1885, reasonable compensation was allowed by the board of commissioners. Leonard v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 8 Colo. App. 338, 46 P. 216 (1896).

        The provisions of this section are mandatory.
        Farmers Union Milling &amp; Elevator Co. v. Smith, 79
        <cite class="co_code">

        , 245 P. 346 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        The compensation given a sheriff by this section for serving a special venire for jurors in a court of record
        is for the service, whether performed by him or by deputy. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 158
        </cite>
        , 40 P. 366 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mileage fee prescribed for the sheriff in this section for serving any process
        is intended solely as a part of the compensation for such services, all of which is to be applied to the payment of his salary. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 158
        </cite>
        , 40 P. 366 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        And the evident intent of the general assembly was to create by the fee act a mileage fee,
        all of which belongs to the officer as part of his compensation for services actually rendered, and no part of which should be applied to the officer's necessary traveling expenses. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 158
        </cite>
        , 40 P. 366 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because by the salary act another mileage fee was provided for, separate and distinct from that in the fee act,
        out of which the officer was to be repaid his actual traveling expenses, and no more. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 158
        </cite>
        , 40 P. 366 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        And under this section an officer who serves a number of writs in the same case upon a single journey is entitled to receive but one mileage fee.
        Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Love, 15
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 430
        </cite>
        , 25 P. 557 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section the sheriff conveying several prisoners to the penitentiary or other place of detention is entitled to but one mileage
        for the service of the mittimus, no matter what may be the number of his prisoners. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Campbell, 52
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 440
        </cite>
        , 123 P. 317 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section inhibits the appointment of a custodian without request in writing of the plaintiff or his attorney
        in an attachment suit, and there is no reason apparent why the rule under the statute of frauds, that a subsequent written admission of a previous parol agreement generally takes the case out of the statute, should not be applied to this section regarding appointment of custodians. Farmers Union Milling &amp; Elevator Co. v. Smith, 79
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 277
        </cite>
        , 245 P. 346 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        But it was held under the facts disclosed that there was a sufficient written recognition
        of a previous oral request for a custodian at a compensation of one dollar a day. Farmers Union Milling &amp; Elevator Co. v. Smith, 79
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 277
        </cite>
        , 245 P. 346 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mileage fee set in subsection (1)(w) does not place a cap on transportation fees
        that may be charged to a defendant. People v. Fogarty, 126 P.3d 238 (Colo. App. 2005).

       <p>
        The purpose and vital importance of an efficient audit were manifest
        from the statutory requirement that all prescribed fees had to be collected in advance by county officers, and when collected had to be paid to the county treasurer, and that any balance left to the credit of the several funds in any year after the salaries and compensation provided for had been paid therefrom, would be placed to the credit of the general county fund.

        For article, "Justice Courts", see 24 Dicta 184 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section imposing a liability in the nature of a penalty is strictly construed;
        and the penalty is not to be extended to cases not within the terms of the statute, or increased beyond the limit prescribed. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Law, 3 Colo. App. 328, 33 P. 143 (1893); Colo. Fuel &amp; Iron Co. v. Lenhart, 6 Colo. App. 511, 41 P. 834 (1895); Hazelton v. Porter, 17 Colo. App. 1, 67 P. 170 (1902); Price v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 22 Colo. App. 315, 124 P. 353 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        By this section the duty of collecting fees in advance is imposed upon the officer
        where the same can be ascertained. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 43
        </cite>
        , 95 P. 289 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section makes the officers responsible for the collection of their fees. Bransom v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 5 Colo. App. 231, 37 P. 957 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Penalty stimulates collection.
        The fact is recognized that sometimes such prior ascertainment may be impossible, and therefore the fees may not be so collected, and in order to stimulate or coerce the collection of the fees earned and belonging to the county, to wit, the excess above the sums necessary to make up the officer's salary, the penalty of charging the uncollected portion thereof against his salary is provided. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 43
        </cite>
        , 95 P. 289 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Negligent or wilful failure results in forfeiture.
        This section makes it the duty of the clerk to collect every fee for services performed by him, and provides a forfeiture if he shall wilfully or negligently fail to do so. Henderson v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 4 Colo. App. 301, 35 P. 880 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        This penalty is not to be enforced unless the failure to make such collection is due to the negligence or wilfulness of the delinquent official. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 43
        </cite>
        , 95 P. 289 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to uncollected fees, a county judge was only liable for the negligent or wilful failure to collect. Price v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 22 Colo. App. 315, 124 P. 353 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a literal sense, the uncollected fees cannot be charged against the officer's salary,
        since the county is only entitled to fees collected above the amount necessary to make up the salary. Price v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 22 Colo. App. 315, 124 P. 353 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        But salary is maximum limit of penalty.
        The amount of the salary received by the officer must be taken as the maximum limit of the penalty for the negligent or wilful failure to collect. Price v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 22 Colo. App. 315, 124 P. 353 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Negligent or wilful failure must be alleged.
        Under this section a complaint against a county judge for surplus fees uncollected had to allege that his failure to collect the same was negligent or wilful. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 43
        </cite>
        , 95 P. 289 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of proof.
        In a suit against a county judge to recover the surplus uncollected fees of his office, the burden of proof was on the county commissioners to show that the fees were negligently or wilfully left uncollected. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 43
        </cite>
        , 95 P. 289 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Slight evidence was sufficient to shift the burden of proof on the officer to establish the exercise of reasonable diligence in endeavoring to collect such unpaid fees. Frost v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 43
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 43
        </cite>
        , 95 P. 289 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of record only affects proof.
        The alleged neglect to make a record of such fees, as in this case, could only affect the matter of proof. Price v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 22 Colo. App. 315, 124 P. 353 (1912).

        Legislative intent.
        By enacting this section the general assembly evinced a legislative intent to require all fees, emoluments, perquisites and commissions collected by a county clerk and recorder to be accounted for and placed in the proper fund in the office of the county treasurer, to be withdrawn therefrom only on warrants properly issued in payment of the salaries of such deputies and assistants as are necessary in the performance of their statutory duties.

      (e) Except as provided in subsection (3)(f) of this section, no elected county officer shall have his or her compensation increased or decreased during the term of office to which he or she has been elected or appointed. All actual and necessary expenses of an elected officer incurred while engaged in business on behalf of the county may be allowed by the board of county commissioners and paid out of the county treasury.

     <p>
      (f) An elected county officer in a county classified for salary purposes under subsection (1.5)(a)(III), (1.5)(a)(IV), (1.5)(a)(V), or (1.5)(a)(VI) of this section may elect in his or her sole discretion to receive an amount of salary that is lower than the amount provided for in this section. The amount of the lower salary received by an officer shall be fifty percent of the amount of the salary otherwise provided for the officer as set forth in this section. Any such election shall be set forth in writing and recorded with the office of the county clerk and recorder during the month of November. Any additional money available to a county as a result of an elected county officer making an election pursuant to this subsection (3)(f) shall remain available for expenditure in the county general fund. An elected county officer who elects to receive a lower salary pursuant to this subsection (3)(f) may subsequently elect to receive a higher salary so long as the amount of the higher salary does not exceed the amount provided for in this section. In no event shall an elected county officer make more than one election per year pursuant to this subsection (3)(f).

       Authority vested in board under phrase "with the approval of the board" does not give board unbridled power
       to change salaries fixed by treasurer. Kanaly v. Wadlow, 31 Colo. App. 193, 502 P.2d 83 (1972), modified, 182
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       General assembly intended to divest board of exclusive power to fix salaries
       and to vest some meaningful power and authority in treasurer. Kanaly v. Wadlow, 31 Colo. App. 193, 502 P.2d 83 (1972), modified, 182
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       But when the county treasurer and the board of county commissioners are unable to agree on prospective salaries
       for the treasurer's employees, the burden in a lawsuit brought to resolve the differences lies with the treasurer or the employee bringing the suit to show that the proposal of the treasurer is reasonable under the circumstances. Wadlow v. Kanaly, 182
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 115

       The board is vested with the ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the fiscal affairs
       of the county. Wadlow v. Kanaly, 182

       And the commissioners are charged with the construction of an annual budget
       from submissions from the various departments of their anticipated financial needs for the ensuing year. Wadlow v. Kanaly, 182

       No authority in county department heads to set salaries.
       To hold that the heads of the various county departments had the authority to set salaries of their employees, not prescribed by statute, unless clearly exorbitant, would be to seriously compound the problems faced by the commissioners in adopting a balanced budget. Wadlow v. Kanaly, 182
       <cite class="co_code">

      <p>
       Board reviews salaries.
       It seems most consistent with the requirements of county government fiscal planning to allow the board to review salaries proposed by the heads of the various departments serving executive and administrative functions in the county. Wadlow v. Kanaly, 182
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 115

       , 511 P.2d 484 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Such an interpretation enables the commissioners to assure a reasonable budgetary process
       and develop a parity in salary levels throughout these various departments. Wadlow v. Kanaly, 182
       <cite class="co_code">

       The power to appoint such assistants and employees as are necessary is vested in the county superintendent of schools,
       who may fix their compensation with the approval of the board of county commissioners. Schroeder v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 313
       </cite>
       , 381 P.2d 820 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       No subsequent authority of board to cut off.
       Where the county superintendent determined that a clerical assistant was necessary and fixed compensation of such assistant with approval of board of county commissioners, the board was thereafter without unilateral power to diminish or cut off compensation of such assistant. Schroeder v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 313
       </cite>
       , 381 P.2d 820 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       As board cannot substitute its judgment.
       By eliminating the salary of a clerical assistant the board of county commissioners eliminated the position, and, in effect, substituted its determination of the necessity for an assistant when that prerogative is vested by law in the duly elected county official. Schroeder v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 313

      </p>
      <p>
       Nor can court.
       A trial court in entering a finding determining that the assistant of the county superintendent of schools is not necessary invades the province of the executive branch of the government and is powerless to take such action. Schroeder v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">

       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 158
       </cite>
       , 40 P. 366 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The allowance for traveling expenses is not a payment for services, but it is a reimbursement
       of money expended, and is in addition to, and independent of, salary, and if the traveling expenses should exceed the amount of mileage, at the rate limited, against which they are chargeable, the full expenses could not be paid, and a proportionate loss would be suffered; but when mileage in either a civil or criminal case has been collected and deposited, it is the duty of the board of commissioners to allow the traveling expenses incurred in the case, payable out of the mileage, if it amounts to so much, or if not, to the extent of the mileage deposited. Bransom v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 5 Colo. App. 231, 37 P. 957 (1894).

       Necessary traveling expenses paid by the sheriff in serving a venire for jurors in a court of record should be allowed by the county.
       Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 158
       </cite>

       If a sheriff travels upon a railroad on a free pass, he cannot be allowed the ordinary railroad fare as expenses necessarily incurred,
       but, notwithstanding he may have such a pass, he may pay the customary fare and include its amount in his expense account. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 158
       </cite>
       , 40 P. 366 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of a sleeping car by a sheriff upon his return journey from transporting a prisoner was not only customary, but was proper
       and convenient, and reasonable, within the meaning of this section, as a legitimate part of the necessary expenses incurred by the sheriff. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 158
       </cite>
       , 40 P. 366 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the liability of the county in such cases depended in part upon the facts and circumstances of each case,
       and the decision of this particular question was limited to the facts of the case. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 158
       </cite>
       , 40 P. 366 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mileage fees, if earned by the officer, had to be collected by him
       of litigants if in civil cases, and the various statutory conditions that made the county liable for costs in criminal cases had to have happened before the sheriff got credit from the county therefor; so that, in compensating the sheriff, he was not only limited to his salary and actual traveling expenses, but to get these he had to first have collected from the parties to suits the various items of fees which went to make up, and out of which only, his compensation was paid. Sargent v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 21

        The general assembly recognizes that in the establishment of the state of Colorado the counties of the territory of Colorado were adopted as the counties of the new state and that there have been additional counties established by law and in accordance with then current methods of surveying and describing county boundaries. The general assembly finds and declares that it is desirable to revise the descriptions of county boundaries to update and establish by law more precise definitions of the boundaries of the several counties of this state as they are known to exist with the use of modern methods and equipment. It is not the intent of the general assembly to effect the transfer of land from one county to another or to adversely affect the title of any property merely because of the redefinition of county boundaries.

        The boundary between two counties, established by legislative act, could not be changed by an artificial changing of the course of the Arkansas river.

        When the Arkansas river channel was altered in 1935-36 it was not a slow and gradual change but a sudden change caused by mechanical or artificial means so as to constitute an avulsion rather than an accretion, and when such a sudden change occurs, there is no alteration in the boundary line; it remains at the location of the river immediately prior to the change.

        The clause excepting, or withdrawing, from the territory included within the limits of the city of Denver all incorporated cities or towns within "said last mentioned boundaries",
        does not change or affect such exterior boundaries. They remain just as defined by metes and bounds in the first part of this section, because the office of the exception is to preserve intact these included municipal organizations, and to exclude the territory covered thereby from that which, were it not for the proviso, would be a part of the territory of the city of Denver.

        are to be construed like patents or grants or segregations of a different date
        where the older in time necessarily concludes, and this principle requires first the determination of Jefferson county's boundaries and the inclusion therein of all territory which its lines would embrace, and the exclusion therefrom of all territory which would otherwise be embraced within the lines of Park county. Link v. Jones, 15 Colo. App. 281, 62 P. 339 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wherever a line is run southerly or south, or due south, the result is precisely the same
        and the line thus stated in a description is to be taken as run due south unless there is some other thing in the description which compels or permits another course in order to work out the description which the grantor has put in a deed or whereby a general assembly has fixed the boundaries of a county. Link v. Jones, 15 Colo. App. 281, 62 P. 339 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore, the description in the location of Jefferson county "thence south to the Platte river"
        starts and runs a line from the junction of North and South Clear creeks due south to the Platte river. Link v. Jones, 15 Colo. App. 281, 62 P. 339 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the general assembly stated the western boundary of Jefferson county and ran the line south from the junction of North and South Clear creeks it ran a line due south making allowance for the magnetic variation, and it must strike the Platte river at the point where that line thus projected would strike the stream. Link v. Jones, 15 Colo. App. 281, 62 P. 339 (1900).

        In this section the term "snowy range" is applied to the mosquito spur,
        but it is designated as "the snowy range east of the Arkansas river". Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 9

        The mosquito spur of the snowy range, the park range, is a distinct and continuous range or chain of mountains
        next and immediately east of the Arkansas river, extending from the snowy range at and between the sources of the Arkansas and Platte rivers southward beyond said third correction line; and the summit of this range is the natural boundary between Chaffee and Park counties. Hollenbeck v. Sykes, 17
        <cite class="co_code">

        The continental divide constitutes, in part, the western boundary of the county of Park,
        at the north, where it is described as "the snowy range, dividing the waters of the Platte from the waters of the Blue". Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 9

        It was held that in this section the words "up the river", at the conclusion of the description of Park county's eastern boundary,
        must be rejected and the call read "thence to the place of beginning", instead of "thence up the river to the place of beginning". Link v. Jones, 15 Colo. App. 281, 62 P. 339 (1900).

        Constitutionality.

     <p>
      Wherever the boundary lines of any county are so indefinite as to make it impossible to determine where such lines are, and when a portion of territory by reason of such indefinite description is claimed by two counties, the board of county commissioners of each county so claiming said territory is authorized to have a survey made to define the boundaries. If it occurs that either county is dissatisfied with the boundary line as thus determined, it may be entitled to require of the other an arbitration for the settlement of the matter, from which arbitration there shall be no appeal, and the decision shall be final.

      When a majority of the taxpaying electors residing in that portion of the territory of any county proposed to be stricken off and annexed to an adjoining county shall petition the board of county commissioners of the county in which such territory is situate to have such portion stricken off and annexed to the adjoining county, giving the area and general boundaries of such territory by natural objects and monuments as near as may be, and shall deposit with such board of county commissioners an amount of money sufficient to pay the expenses of the surveying and platting of such territory, it is the duty of the said commissioners to have such territory surveyed and platted in a suitable manner and to cause to be submitted to the registered electors of such county at the general election next after the filing of such petition and plat with them the question of whether such portion of the territory of their county shall be so stricken off. The board of county commissioners shall also require the county clerk and recorder, in giving the notice required by law of the general election then next ensuing, to insert therein a notice to said registered electors that the question of striking off such territory from their county, particularly describing such territory by metes and bounds as shown by said survey, will be submitted to them for their approval or rejection and that they should designate on their ballots their approval thereof, which shall be expressed by the words "for the new county line", or their dissent thereto, expressed by the words "against the new county line". The board of county commissioners of the county to which such territory has been annexed may, in their discretion, pay the necessary expenses of such survey and plat by warrant on the treasury as in other cases.

      Editor's note:
      Subsection (10) of this section contained a provision that repealed the entire section effective August 5, 2003. Subsection (10) was deleted by amendment in House Bill 03-1239 to give continuing effect to the section. The bill also amended subsection (8) and added a new subsection (8.5). This bill did not contain a safety clause. A bill without a safety clause usually takes effect on the day following the expiration of the ninety-day period after adjournment of the general assembly. Therefore, House Bill 03-1239 would normally take effect on August 6, 2003, one day after the repeal of the section was to take effect. An argument could be made that the deletion of the repealer and the other amendments to the section were of no effect because the repeal had already taken effect on the previous day. However, such an interpretation would defeat the general assembly's purpose in enacting the bill. For that reason, if a court is asked to address this circumstance, it could reach the conclusion that the amendment deleting the repeal should be given effect as of the date the governor signed the bill on April 22, 2003, rather than the technical effective date (see People v. Tacorante, 624 P.2d 1324 (Colo. 1981), where a similar conclusion was reached). In view of these factors, the repeal of this section is not reflected in the version printed above; rather, the section appears as amended by House Bill 03-1239.

If the county surveyor of either of such counties shall not appear or assist the state engineer in making such survey after due notice so to do, it shall in no manner affect or invalidate such survey, or the boundary lines as they may be fixed by such state engineer.

      <p>
       An actual survey and marking of the line upon the ground is intended by this section,
       and an attempt by the state engineer and county surveyors to fix a disputed county boundary line without going upon the ground and making an actual survey, was unauthorized and their proceedings were without any force or effect whatever. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 25

       Equitable not special action to correct errors of engineer.
       It was held where the state engineer having, under this section, established the boundary between contiguous counties, a proceeding instituted by one of them, under the statute, to correct alleged errors of the state engineer, is an equitable action, and not a special proceeding.

       Proper venue in county where property located.
       An action to judicially define and settle a boundary line, as fixed by the general assembly, involves an interest in real property, is for the determination of a form of an interest or right in real property, and affects property, and should be tried in the county where the property is situated.

       Survey without effect if action brought within six months.
       If within six months of the filing of the report of the state engineer upon his survey of a county boundary, an action is brought, pursuant to this section, to determine such boundary, such survey is without effect for any purpose. People v. District Court, 66
       <cite class="co_code">

       Jurisdiction must be affirmatively pled.
       The complaint in an action under this section to determine and settle a disputed boundary line between counties, after one has been run out and established by the state engineer, must contain affirmative and positive allegations showing the proceedings to have been such as to confer jurisdiction. Commissioners of Routt County v. Commissioners of Grand County, 4 Colo. App. 306, 35 P. 1061 (1894).

      <p>
       As must statute of limitations.
       In order to confer jurisdiction in an action under the section to determine and settle a disputed boundary line between counties, after one has been run out and established by the state engineer, the complaint must affirmatively show that it was commenced within six months after the filing of the description of the boundary line by the state engineer. Commissioners of Routt County v. Commissioners of Grand County, 4 Colo. App. 306, 35 P. 1061 (1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       Action under this section and estoppel separate causes.
       A complaint setting forth (1) the establishment of a county line by the state engineer, and that the plaintiff county is dissatisfied therewith, (2) the long recognition by both counties and the inhabitants and officials thereof, of the particular line for which the plaintiff contends, contains two separate causes of action, one the action authorized by this section and the other an attempt to set up an estoppel. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 58
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 67

      <p>
       Court renders judgment on evidence.
       In an action between counties under this section to establish a boundary line, the court has jurisdiction to render judgment upon the evidence, and is not limited to a determination of the accuracy of the line run by the state engineer. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 2 Colo. App. 412, 31 P. 183 (1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section broadly confers upon a court of competent jurisdiction the power to determine and settle the disputed line,
       and it must be held that the jurisdiction conferred is ample enough to enable the court, on the testimony before it, to determine what the line is, and where it should be run. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 2 Colo. App. 412, 31 P. 183 (1892).

       The constitutional prohibition against local or special laws in certain enumerated cases,
       locating or changing county seats being one of those cases, was held to be wholly prospective and intended to affect only future legislation. People v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 6

       Construction with general election laws.
       Although registration of electors to vote on the question of removal of a county seat is governed by this and the following sections, they are not exclusive but must be construed with the provisions concerning general elections. People ex rel. Roberg v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 86

       The section governing registration of electors does not repeal this article
       concerning elections for the removal of county seats. People ex rel. Roberg v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 86

       In the absence of fraud and where there is a substantial compliance with the statute,
       informalities and innocent departures on the part of the election board in the matter of an election to remove a county seat, will not render the election void, where it appears that there was a conscientious determination on the part of the election officials to ascertain the will of the electorate on the question submitted, which was carried into effect. People ex rel. Roberg v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 86

       The act of February 11, 1881, was intended to establish a uniform procedure
       regulating all elections concerning county seats, and it applies to the conduct of an election for the permanent location of a county seat. Town of Sugar City v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 57

       Since the act of 1881 was inconsistent with and repugnant to former legislation upon this subject,
       although it contained no repealing clause, it was well settled that, notwithstanding such omission, so much of former legislation as was in conflict with the latter provisions was impliedly repealed. Town of Sugar City v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 57

       It was purely a question for the general assembly as to whether the same rule should be adopted as to residence in the case of an election to locate a county seat,
       as ยง 2 of art. XIV, Colo. Const., had already adopted in the case of an election upon the question of removal of a county seat, and the length of residence required in the latter case was definitely fixed by the constitution, and the general assembly was left free to determine the qualifications of voters at an election upon the question of the location of a county seat, unquestionably, since there is no specific constitutional inhibition, and the statute is general, applying alike to all similarly situated, the general assembly had the power and authority to enact it.

       Under the constitution the general assembly has no power to remove a county seat.

      </p>
      <p>
       Regulated by general law.
       The constitution deprives the general assembly of power to remove a county seat, but permits the question of such removal to be regulated by general law, with the limitations, that there can be no removal unless a majority of the electors vote for it, and that no proposition on the subject shall be submitted more often than once in four years. Coleman v. People, 7 Colo. App. 243, 42 P. 1041 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       Voting majorities required for placement or removal.
       The plain meaning of this section is that where the county seat has not been permanently located a majority of all the legal votes upon the proposition must be in favor of some one place, and if it has been permanently established, it requires a two-thirds vote in favor of some one place before a removal can be effected.

If, for the purpose of making such copies, it becomes necessary to remove such records from the room where they are usually kept to some other room in the courthouse where such copying apparatus may be installed for such purpose, the county clerk and recorder, in his or her discretion, may charge to the person or corporation making such copies a fee of ten dollars per hour for the service of the deputy who has charge of such records while they are being so copied; but such fees shall not be charged to one person or corporation unless the same fee is likewise charged to every person or corporation copying such records.

       The amendment to art. VI, Colo. Const., transfers most of the former jurisdiction of the then county courts to the district courts,
       including, among others, the type of matters (juvenile, mental health, domestic relations, probate) intended to be kept private by this section. Times-Call Publ'g Co. v. Wingfield, 159

       Other than "interested" persons allowed access to court records.
       This section does not mean that judges and clerks of courts of record are prohibited from allowing persons other than parties in interest or their attorneys to examine the pleadings or other papers on file in such courts; however, it does mean that although there is no absolute right to examine such pleadings or other papers, persons could be allowed to do so at discretion of court.

       Press not barred from court records.
       This section, originating in 1885, was certainly not intended to bar the press from access to pleadings and court records in civil actions involving matters of public interest such as school bond election contests. Times-Call Publ'g Co. v. Wingfield, 159

       This section was not designed to allow individuals who wish to abstract the entire records for future profit in their private business,
       the privilege of using continuously the public property, and of monopolizing from day to day, for months and years, a portion of the time and attention of the county clerk against his will and without recompense. Bean v. People ex rel. Uppercu, 7

       Mandamus proper remedy.
       Where a county clerk and recorder refuses to allow abstractors the use of the county records for the purpose of making abstracts, mandamus is a proper remedy for them to resort to. Stocknan v. Brooks, 17
       <cite class="co_code">

       Sufficient allegation for mandamus.
       An allegation by plaintiffs, in their petition for mandamus, that the county clerk and recorder refused to allow them to examine the records, or make memoranda therefrom, though often requested to do so, is sufficient, since by the terms of this section any person has the right to inspect the records; and it is not necessary to allege that plaintiffs did not have all the information that could be acquired by the enforcement of the writ.

       No mandamus to allow abstracting entire land records.
       A county clerk is not compellable, by mandamus, to allow abstract makers to use his office and the county records for the purpose of abstracting the entire records of the land titles of the county for sale. Bean v. People ex rel. Uppercu, 7

       No interpretation of vacancy needed.
       So simple, direct, and integrated is the language of this section that there is no room for interpretation as to when a vacancy occurs. People v. Enlow, 135
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 249

       Vacancy applies not to the incumbent, but to the term, or to the office, or both,
       depending generally upon the context. People ex rel. Bentley v. Le Fevre, 21
       <cite class="co_code">

       The court said that the word "vacancy" as used in modern times relates not only to the office which is to be filled, but to the term for which the appointment is to be made. Monash v. Rhoades, 11 Colo. App. 404, 53 P. 236 (1898), aff'd, 27

       Conviction works disqualification and vacancy.
       Conviction under the statute of an infamous crime or of an offense involving the violation of the oath of office operates as a disqualification so as to create a vacancy forthwith in the office. People v. Enlow, 135
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 249
       </cite>
       , 310 P.2d 539 (1957).

      <p>
       Instant vacancy upon conviction.
       The happening of the event fixes the time and fulfillment of the vacancy, and the mingling of situations which ordinarily would give rise to vacancies ipso facto with others that do not necessarily create vacancies ipso facto, without difference of treatment in the statute, is significant, thus, among the listed events creating a vacancy in office are three which by their very nature result in termination of office holding, and the statutory declaration that the office becomes vacant upon the happening thereof seems almost surplusage; also reference is made to the provisions relating to the death of an incumbent, or his resignation, or his removal; the occurrence of any of these events establishes instanter a vacancy; and to hold that the death of an incumbent, or his resignation, or his removal effects an immediate vacancy in the office but that the same is not true as to an officer convicted of either of the described offenses would result in a strained, unnatural and illogical construction, in view of the language employed in the statute which makes no such distinction. People v. Enlow, 135
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 249
       </cite>
       , 310 P.2d 539 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the mere doing of a prohibited act by an official, without his conviction therefor, does not create a vacancy.

       If a county official was convicted of income tax evasion,
       and if such amounts to conviction of an infamous crime or an offense involving a violation of his official oath, within the purview of this section, the office of sheriff of Jefferson county became vacant by operation of the law on the date of such conviction. People v. Enlow, 135

       Effect of out-of-state convictions.
       The fact that the general assembly has provided in certain statutes that convictions in other jurisdictions shall operate disadvantageously in the state to the convicted person, and did not so provide in this section, requires us to hold that, as to the latter, the general assembly purposely omitted words which would have given effect to foreign convictions, because to ascertain the intent of the general assembly enacting a particular statute, resort may be had to a comparison in language of the statute under study with analogous but unrelated legislation. People v. Enlow, 135

       A conviction in the federal court for this state is not conclusive on a question of disqualification to hold an office of honor,
       trust, or profit under the laws of Colorado. People v. Enlow, 135

       When resignation without effect.
       The right of any public official to resign cannot be doubted; but when the resignation is predicated upon the premise, stated, or which his conduct may imply, that it is to avoid performing a specific duty in the interest of a party in whose behalf such official is legally bound to act, his resignation, however formally tendered and accepted, will be regarded as without effect.

       Where the county clerk-elect died before qualification, a vacancy in the office occurred on the expiration of the term

       Where the sheriff incumbent was reelected but failed to qualify for the second term, and died before his first term expired,
       one appointed by the board of county commissioners to the vacancy, held only to the second Tuesday of the succeeding January, the day appointed by law for the commencement of the second term of his predecessor, even though by express terms, his appointment was "until the next general election"; that upon the second Tuesday of the succeeding January there was a vacancy, and one then appointed by the county commissioners to fill it was entitled to the office until the next general election.

       This section is silent as to the manner of calling special meetings,

In no event shall there be more than five percent deviation between the most populous and the least populous district in each county, at the time such district boundaries are adopted.

One county commissioner must be elected from each of such districts by the voters of the whole county.

      <p>
       Intent of "by the county commissioners".
       When the general assembly in 1963 amended this statute by adding the words "by the county commissioners", the supreme court believed to be obvious that it was the general assembly's intent to make it clear and unmistakable that the county commissioners henceforth had the duty and responsibility to maintain their commission districts as compact districts with populations as nearly equal as possible. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Edwards, 171
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 499
       </cite>
       , 468 P.2d 857 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does, in fact, impose a positive duty upon the commissioners to redistrict.
       Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Edwards, 171
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 499
       </cite>
       , 468 P.2d 857 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the general assembly used the word "shall", it intended to impose upon the county commissioners a mandatory duty
       and not suggest merely a permissive or discretionary act. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Edwards, 171
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 499
       </cite>
       , 468 P.2d 857 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is tantamount to a command upon the county commissioners to properly apportion their commissioner districts,
       and either neglecting or refusing to obey this command amounts to a disregard of statutory duty in not taking affirmative action. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Edwards, 171
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 499
       </cite>

      </p>
      <p>
       The functions of a board of county commissioners under this section are administrative, and it cannot evade its responsibility
       to take the necessary affirmative action where such is required to correct malapportionment of commissioner districts. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Edwards, 171
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 499
       </cite>
       , 468 P.2d 857 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure or refusal to act proper basis for judicial intercession.
       Either the failure within a reasonable time or the refusal to act upon the petition of citizens when redistricting is required in order to comply with the law, is a proper basis for judicial intercession. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Edwards, 171
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 499
       </cite>
       , 468 P.2d 857 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       And mandamus has been upheld as a remedy to require county commissioners to comply with this section.

       There is no reason to distinguish between "compact" in the constitutional provision relating to legislative districts
       and the same term in the statute concerning commissioner districts. Allen v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 178
       <cite class="co_code">

       Compactness requirement satisfied.
       Where county was redistricted into three districts, one of which had an area of five square miles and the other two of which had areas of over 1200 square miles, but where the new districts were much more equal in population than the old, the requirement of compactness was satisfied.

       Commissioners may express views privately.
       Where, at an earlier private meeting, two of the county commissioners agreed to support a redistricting plan when it was proposed by residents of a city in one of the proposed districts, this conduct of the two commissioners did not invalidate the later action of the board in adopting the plan, because it is desirable for commissioners to seek the sentiments of various citizens and it is not improper for them to state their views on matters which will later come before them for action.

       Power to issue warrant in board alone.
       While a county warrant is to be signed by the chairman of the board of county commissioners, and also to be signed and attested by the clerk, yet the power to issue a county warrant is vested alone in the board of county commissioners and can be only exercised at a meeting of the board.

       And a warrant drawn and signed without any action of the board is a nullity in the hands of any one chargeable with notice
       of the irregularity, and in an action against the county treasurer to compel payment, he may allege in his defense the facts which show the warrant to be void. Stoddard v. Benton, 6

       Power to issue county warrants only in board.
       While a county warrant is to be signed by the chairman of the board of county commissioners, and also to be signed and attested by the clerk, yet the power to issue a county warrant is vested alone in the board of commissioners and can be only exercised at a meeting of the board.

       Duty to be available to perform certain functions and duty to attend meetings of board of county commissioners.
       The responsibilities of the position of the clerk of the board of county commissioners include either being available, or having a deputy available, during regular business hours to perform the constitutional and statutory functions. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Hatfield, 39

       Duty when clerk fails to attend meeting.
       Where the clerk is notified of a meeting of the board and fails to attend, the board necessarily has authority to record its own proceedings and thereafter approve those minutes. Upon being tendered such minutes, the clerk must record them in the proper book regardless of the fact that neither she nor her deputies actually recorded the proceedings. Bd. of County Comm'rs v.

       Duties imposed by general assembly.
       While the office of county clerk is created by the constitution, none of his duties are therein defined, but all the duties pertaining to the office, both in his capacity as clerk and as recorder of deeds, are to be prescribed and enjoined by the general assembly, and the duties he is to perform as recorder of deeds have been specifically defined and imposed by this and the following sections, and it was clearly within the province of the general assembly to impose upon the clerk in his capacity of recorder of deeds the duties enjoined upon him by this and the following sections.

       Public record defined.
       It is said that a public record is one required by law to be kept, or necessary to be kept, in the discharge of a duty imposed by law, or directed by law to serve as a memorial and evidence of something written, said, or done. Treat v. McDonough, 148

       Tract indices kept by the county clerk and recorder for the purpose of preparing abstracts of title, even though not within the terms of the statute, constitute an appropriate mode of discharging the clerk's duties, hence, it was not only his right but his duty to keep them and having done so they became public property subject to public use as provided by statute.

       General public right to inspect or copy public records.
       At common law, due to land ownership by a very limited number of people, there was no general public right to inspect or copy public records; however, this concept later gave way, particularly in the United States, to a recognition of such a right due to our belief in widespread ownership of real property. Treat v. McDonough, 148

       But a wide discretion was necessarily vested in the county clerk with reference to permitting the examination of the records
       of his office by those other than employees thereof, because the liability of having the records mutilated, changed, or obliterated was always present when strangers were about the office; and while it was necessary, perhaps, that abstracters had to be allowed to examine and make copies from these records they were in so doing subjected to such reasonable regulations as the county clerk prescribed.

       The right of an abstractor to inspect and make memoranda of the contents of the records, etc., in the county clerk's office, is subordinate to the right of the clerk and recorder so to regulate his office as to maintain the sanctity of the records, etc., pertaining thereto.

       Reasonable regulation of access.
       A rule established by the county clerk and recorder provided that parties desiring to examine the records of the office for the purpose of making abstracts would be permitted to do so upon any day, when the office was required to be kept open under the law, between the hours of nine and twelve in the forenoon, and one and four in the afternoon; provided, that on the days when the county commissioners are in session in the office, said memoranda and copies may be made between the hours of nine and ten in the forenoon and four and five in the afternoon, and at no other times during said days, was held a reasonable regulation.

       Public record is prima facie evidence of collateral matters appropriately incorporated therein
       when the document has been signed under oath and properly attested to, as such precautions afford at least a presumption of trustworthiness with respect to matters contained within the document. Oak Creek Power Co. v. Colo. River Water Conservation Dist., 182

       Under this section, articles of incorporation, when so recorded, may be used in evidence for the purpose of establishing any fact other than that of corporate existence;
       and, even without this provision of the law, it is held that where the record or document appointed by law is not part of the fact to be proved, but is merely a collateral or subsequent memorial of the fact, it has not this exclusive character, but any other legal proof is admitted. Thus, the date of incorporation is a secondary fact, and could be proved by collateral circumstances or parol evidence. Schiffer v. Adams, 13

       Right of general public to inspect and copy.
       At common law, due to land ownership by a very limited number of people, there was no general public right to inspect or copy public records; however, this concept later gave way, particularly in the United States, to a recognition of such a right due to our belief in widespread ownership of real property.

       Because the original sheriff training statute sought to impose qualifications for the job of sheriff in the form of certification requirements, it was unconstitutional.

       Under this and the two following sections, the sheriff is primarily liable to any person who may be damaged
       by the improper official acts of his undersheriff, because in legal contemplation, all the acts of the undersheriff are the acts of the principal, for which he and his bondsmen are liable, while he has his remedy over against the undersheriff and his bondsmen; this being the law, the acts and doings of one as undersheriff could only be regarded by the defendant as those of the sheriff, insofar as they were the official acts of the office. Barton v. Continental Oil Co., 5 Colo. App. 341, 38 P. 432 (1894).

       And where a deputy sheriff is acting in his official capacity and under color of his office,
       if in the performance thereof, he exceeds the limit of his authority, not only is the deputy himself liable to one injured thereby, but the sheriff and the latter's official surety are also liable. Corder v. People ex rel. Smiley, 87

       For an unlawful act of a deputy sheriff, which is not committed by him in the discharge of his official duties, while he himself is liable to damages to one injured thereby, sureties on the official bond of a sheriff may not be held. Corder v. People ex rel. Smiley, 87

       If the sheriff or undersheriff retains money received officially, the sheriff, as an officer of court, may be held liable
       to a proceeding for contempt, but such summary proceedings for the collection of a debt should be discouraged. Barton v. Continental Oil Co., 5 Colo. App. 341, 38 P. 432 (1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       The service of garnishee process on a deputy does not act upon a fund in his hands collected under execution,
       because, in law, it is in the possession of the sheriff; neither does it relieve his principal from accounting for the money. Tate v. People ex rel. Dewees, 6 Colo. App. 202, 40 P. 471 (1895).

     <p>
      Each sheriff may appoint as many deputies as the sheriff may think proper and may revoke such appointments at will; except that a sheriff shall adopt personnel policies, including policies for the review of revocation of appointments. Before revoking an appointment of a deputy, the sheriff shall notify the deputy of the reason for the proposed revocation and shall give the deputy an opportunity to be heard by the sheriff. Persons may also be deputized by the sheriff or undersheriff in writing to do particular acts.

        Statute supersedes manual.
        An employee may not insist upon adherence to county or departmental policies and procedures regarding termination when this section specifically provides that the employee serves only at the will of an elected official. Therefore, a policy manual did not preclude a sheriff from exercising his statutory prerogative to terminate an employee. Seeley v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 771 P.2d 21 (Colo. App. 1989), aff'd, 791 P.2d 696 (Colo. 1990) (decided under law in effect prior to 2006 amendment) (but see Cummings v. Arapahoe County Sheriff's Dept.,

       <p>
        Responsibility of sheriffs.
        Because this section makes sheriffs responsible for the official acts of their deputies and undersheriffs, it is consistent that it grants authority to the sheriffs to dismiss deputy sheriffs at their pleasure. Therefore, a sheriff cannot limit his power to terminate deputy sheriffs because that would forbid something the state expressly authorized. Seeley v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 791 P.2d 696 (Colo. 1990) (decided under law in effect prior to 2006 amendment) (but see Cummings v. Arapahoe County Sheriff's Dept.,

       <p>
        But it is not an unrestricted right.
        The fact that this section makes the sheriff liable for the acts of his deputies does not guarantee the unrestricted right to hire or discharge his employees without regard to the merit system of the city and county of Denver. City &amp; County of Denver, v. Rinker, 148

       <p>
        Before terminating a deputy, the sheriff must "notify the deputy of the reason for the proposed revocation" and "give the deputy an opportunity to be heard by the sheriff". Cummings v. Arapahoe County Sheriff's Dept.,

        , 440 P.3d 1166.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sheriff must also adopt policies "for the review of revocation of appointments". These policies may grant rights to deputies beyond those specified in statute, but these policies need not be binding. Cummings v. Arapahoe County Sheriff's Dept.,
        <cite class="COA">

        Methods of concern to people.
        Because the office of sheriff is a county office and not a state office, the method of selection and tenure of the officer designated to carry out the duties of the position became the concern of the people of Denver by authority expressly granted to them by all of the people of the state under art. XX, Colo. Const., and this is true even though those officers might be required to perform duties which were of statewide concern such as the duties imposed by constitution upon the county clerk and recorder, county sheriff, treasurer or assessor.

        Appointment and removal upon merit and fitness in Denver.
        The people of Denver, acting under the powers given them by art. XX, Colo. Const., have so changed the method of appointment and removal of deputies by sheriffs so that in Denver the appointment and removal of such deputies is upon merit and fitness to perform the work.

        Sheriffs and jailers employees in Denver.
        Since in the city and county of Denver, the salaries of deputy sheriffs and jailers are not set by the charter they are therefore, by charter definition, employees. City &amp; County of Denver v. Rinker, 148

        Deputy could not be suspended for joining police union.
        Although a deputy sheriff may not have had a right, per se, to continued public employment under applicable Colorado law as a sheriff's deputy, and may not have been entitled to any form of notice or hearing either under the State Administrative Procedure Act, or under constitutional principles, he could not be suspended or dismissed for joining a police officers' union.

       Under this section, the general assembly has imposed the following duties upon a sheriff:
       The sheriff shall have charge and custody of the jails of his county, and of the prisoners in the same, and shall keep them himself, or by his deputy or jailer, for whose acts he and his sureties shall be liable. McMillan v. Hammond, 158

The fire protection district or municipality may recover the costs incurred in a civil action against the property owner or the responsible party or may, by resolution of its board or governing body adopted at a public hearing after notice to the affected parties, certify to the county treasurer the amount of any costs incurred that remains uncollected after diligent effort for a period greater than one hundred eighty days. Such certification is subject to the appeal process and all other remedies, if any, provided in the "State Administrative Procedure Act", article 4 of title 24, C.R.S. If the fire protection district or municipality prevails, the amount certified shall be collected by the treasurer in the same manner as taxes are authorized to be collected pursuant to section  39-10-107, C.R.S. To defray the costs of collection, the treasurer shall be authorized to charge an amount equal to ten percent of the amount collected.

       A sheriff is an officer of the court charged with the duty of carrying out the orders and decrees of the court.
       Struble v. Barger, 128
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 188

       , 261 P.2d 497 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       But sheriffs are not required to be learned in the law and when the sheriff obeys the order of the judge, he is not liable for so doing.
       Struble v. Barger, 128
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 188
       </cite>
       , 261 P.2d 497 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the sheriff is "an executive officer, whose sole duty is to execute, and not to decide on the truth or sufficiency of the processes
       committed to him for service". Struble v. Barger, 128
       <cite class="co_code">

       , 261 P.2d 497 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the sheriff is protected because it would be inequitable and unjust to hold him responsible for acts of others over whom he has no control
       and for defects of which he had no notice; to hold otherwise would mean that the officer must act at his peril or delay until he has had an opportunity to search out legal niceties of procedure or substantive law. Struble v. Barger, 128
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 188

       , 261 P.2d 497 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the execution of process, the power possessed by the sheriff is conferred by the statutes,
       and no power exists in him except such as is expressly so conferred or may be fairly implied. McArthur v. Boynton, 19 Colo. App. 234, 74 P. 540 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff is the only officer to whom processes, writs, and orders of courts may be directed.
       Blitz v. Moran, 17 Colo. App. 253, 67 P. 1020 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a judicial foreclosure of a mortgage the sheriff alone is authorized to execute the decree of foreclosure and sell the land, and it is error for the court to appoint a commissioner, other than the sheriff, to make such foreclosure sale, where such appointment is at the time objected to. Blitz v. Moran, 17 Colo. App. 253, 67 P. 1020 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       An officer cannot execute process unless it is directed to him for service,
       or to the class of officers to which he belongs, and no statute authorized the execution of process issuing from justices' courts in civil actions, by sheriffs or their deputies, as such. Porter v. Stapp, 6
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 32
       </cite>

      <p>
       Where a writ of attachment directed to the sheriff of one county was attempted to be executed by the sheriff of another
       county levying it upon property in his county, the levy was void and could not be cured by amendment after the attempted levy by changing the direction of the writ to the county in which the levy was made. McArthur v. Boynton, 19 Colo. App. 234, 74 P. 540 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a distraint warrant was a nonjudicial process, precept, or order made by lawful authority,
       it was the duty of the sheriff to serve and execute the same according to law. Goldsmith v. McAnally, 92
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 384
       </cite>
       , 20 P.2d 1009 (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the issuance of a distraint warrant did not constitute a delegation of power to collect by the treasurer to the sheriff;
       in rendering the services, the sheriff merely acted as a peace officer in the performance of his duty. Goldsmith v. McAnally, 92
       <cite class="co_code">

      <p>
       A scire facias or summons to hear errors issued by the clerk of the supreme court must be directed to the sheriff
       of the county where the defendant in error resides or may be found, and no other person than such sheriff or his authorized deputy has authority to serve such summons; an attempted service of such summons made by a person not authorized by law to make such service is a nullity.

      <p>
       This section refers only to fees, and not to actual reasonable expenses incurred
       in caring for the property held by the sheriff under attachment, and the court has determined that the sheriff is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable charges incurred in taking possession of, removing and keeping property taken on a writ of attachment. Cramer v. Brasher, 15

       Where the sheriff retains moneys above his proper fees and costs, the party entitled to the surplus may recover
       the same by action, and the remedy in such cases is not limited to a proceeding to retax the sheriff's fees and costs, though that course may be pursued, and though the suit may be for treble damages under this section, still, under appropriate allegations, there may be a recovery as for money had and received.

       except insofar as it provides for the entering of judgment upon the bond, and in the absence of a statute the rule is that to entitle the obligee to maintain an action upon a general promise of indemnity against damages of liability, it is not necessary that he should have given notice of a suit against him in which the judgment upon which the breach is predicated was rendered, if, however, no notice is given, the judgment is only prima facie evidence against the obligors and may be attacked on the ground that the obligee failed to avail himself of a good defense or that it was obtained by fraud or collusion.

       Regularly, when the sheriff is a party to an action, his official character should appear by allegation in the declaration
       or by suggestion of record; courts, however, take judicial notice of who are their own officers, and, in the absence of any proof to the contrary, the court in this instance was justified in presuming the identity of the defendant and the sheriff. Coon v. Rigden, 4

      The testimony shall be reduced to writing, under the coroner's order, and subscribed by the witnesses, and the person writing such testimony shall be paid from the county treasury the same fees prescribed for jurors attending inquests concerning deaths. Such testimony, in the discretion of the coroner, may be taken down in shorthand by a competent stenographer, who shall first be sworn by the coroner to correctly take down such testimony and correctly transcribe the same. The stenographer shall receive the usual per diem and fees paid official court reporters for like services to be paid by the board of county commissioners. Upon the request of the coroner, the stenographer shall transcribe the testimony and transmit it to the coroner, and it shall not be necessary in such case for the witnesses to subscribe the same. If the testimony is not transcribed and transmitted, the stenographer shall file his name and address and the notes of the testimony with the district court, and the district court shall keep such materials for a period of seven years from the time of the transmittal of the coroner's inquisition. The coroner shall return his inquisition and list of witnesses to the district court, and such notes if transcribed and transmitted by such stenographer shall have the same force and effect as testimony written out under the coroner's order and subscribed by the witnesses.

       The bond of the county treasurer is the measure of his duties as treasurer,
       and is the contract covering his duties and all those in his employ performing the duties of the office. Goss v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 4
       <cite class="co_code">

       </cite>

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section neither a deputy treasurer nor clerk gives a bond to the public for the faithful performance
       of the duties he undertakes, and the relation of debtor and creditor between the county and the treasurer is unaffected by the circumstance that the duties of the latter are discharged by deputy or clerical agency, and there is no such privity between the county or the public, and the deputy or clerk, as to create an implied contract between them in the face of an express contract between the treasurer and the public, embracing the duties of the office by whomsoever performed. Goss v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 4
       <cite class="co_code">

       It constitutes a trust fund, which, if diverted or misappropriated, may be recovered

       Interest due and sureties liable.
       Money in the hands of a county treasurer belonging to a county, and not turned over to his successor at the time the latter assumed the duties of the office, would draw interest at the legal rate from that date, and the sureties on his official bond are liable to the county for such money with interest.

       No term of office.
       While this section provides that a county treasurer may appoint a deputy, there is no law fixing the term of office of such a deputy, and with his compensation and term of office the public has nothing to do. Tureck v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 108

       There being no contractual privity between one acting as deputy county treasurer and the public,
       in a suit by such a deputy against the county commissioners for salary alleged to be due him, it was held, in the circumstances of the case, that the trial court properly directed a verdict in favor of defendants. Tureck v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 108

      It is the duty of the county treasurer to apportion and keep all taxes collected by him or her in the several funds for which the taxes were levied, and it shall not be lawful to use the moneys belonging to any fund for the purpose of paying warrants drawn upon some other fund or for the purpose of paying warrants issued before April 2, 1998, which properly should have been drawn upon some other fund; but the amount of interest gained through the investment of county funds, regardless of the origin of such funds, may be credited to the general fund of the county by the county treasurer, unless such investment is made from specific funds allocated for a definite purpose and so maintained. The treasurer and the sureties on his or her official bond or the insurer on the crime insurance policy, as applicable, shall be liable at the action of any taxpayer of the county for any violation of this section.

       County warrants are payable in the order of their presentation to the county treasurer, and not otherwise,
       and the law enters into and becomes part of the contract between the county and the holders of its warrants, and each registered warrant matures as soon as sufficient money has accumulated in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund for its payment, after paying all other warrants of the same class whose registry was prior in time.

       Contractual obligation.
       It is settled by authority that where the law, at the time of the issuance of a warrant, provides for its payment in the order of its presentation this becomes a part of the contract and cannot be altered or changed, at least without an equally safe, certain, and speedy provision for payment.

       Right to sue.
       It was held that a county warrant payable out of any money in the treasury appropriated for county expenditures was a written acknowledgment of indebtedness by the county and if not paid, when presented, could be sued on by the legal holder, although there was no money in the treasury to pay.

       Since the general assembly has exclusive jurisdiction over tax matters, county treasurers may exercise only such powers as have been delegated

       The county treasurer and the assessor in whom the power of assessment and collection of taxes is confided must be qualified electors

     <p>
      It is the duty of the county treasurer to assess, at a fair value, the property of any person liable to pay taxes which the county assessor has failed to assess, to place the same on the tax roll, and to collect taxes on the same in the manner provided by law. Such treasurer shall not be compelled to assess such property in person; and he is authorized to administer oaths to such persons, or any others, touching the value of said property.

       There is a well-recognized distinction between a deputy and an assistant;
       the former must be a qualified elector, take the oath of office and give bond to the assessor, whereas the latter need not be a qualified elector and is not required to take the oath of office or to give bond, because a deputy assessor performs duties requiring the exercise of discretion; not so an assistant. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Davis, 94
       <cite class="co_code">

       No power is conferred on the assessor to create assessment districts,
       nor can he appoint deputy assessors until such districts are created, and some discretion is lodged in the board of county commissioners as to when the necessity arises for such division of the county. Roberts v. People, 9
       <cite class="co_code">

      <p>
       Reimbursement for clerk.
       Since it was not through any neglect or default of the assessor that a county was not divided into districts which would have authorized him to appoint deputies instead of clerks, it would be inequitable to require the assessor to bear the expenses thus necessarily incurred; having paid the clerks, the assessor's right to reimbursement, although not covered by the express terms of this section, may be fairly implied therefrom, also the power of the commissioners to allow the claim. Roberts v. People, 9
       <cite class="co_code">

       Commissioners' contract for assessment ultra vires.
       Where board of county commissioners, under its authority to manage the business of the county, entered into a contract with plaintiffs to fix valuations of land, which assessor admittedly was unable to determine, such contract is ultra vires and void, because the right to employ capable assistants comes within the purview of the duties primarily conferred on the assessor and cannot be claimed as an implied power of the board of county commissioners, because the board, as such, has no authority to impose itself upon the express powers of another county officer.

        A county is not an independent governmental entity existing by reason of any inherent sovereign authority of its residents,
        rather, it is a political subdivision of the state, existing only for the convenient administration of the state government, created to carry out the will of the state. Stermer v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 5 Colo. App. 379, 38 P. 839 (1895); Colburn v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 15 Colo. App. 90, 61 P. 241 (1900); Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Love, 172

       <p>
        A county in Colorado is nothing more than an agency of the state
        in the general administration of the state policy, and its powers are solely governmental. Stermer v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 5 Colo. App. 379, 38 P. 839 (1895); Colburn v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 15 Colo. App. 90, 61 P. 241 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        And it does not, like a municipal corporation, possess a complete local government
        of its own, executive, legislative, and judicial. Colburn v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 15 Colo. App. 90, 61 P. 241 (1900).
       </p>

        Express and implied powers.
        As a political subdivision, a county, and its commissioners, possess only such powers as are expressly conferred upon them by the constitution and statutes, and such incidental implied powers as are reasonably necessary to carry out such express powers. Stermer v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 5 Colo. App. 379, 38 P. 839 (1895); Colburn v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 15 Colo. App. 90, 61 P. 241 (1900); Farnik v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 139

        Statutory taxing duties on behalf of others.
        Counties and county officers are charged with specific statutory duties in assessing property for tax purposes, levying taxes, collecting taxes, foreclosing tax liens when the taxes are not paid, acquiring title to tax delinquent property, and disposing of property so acquired, and in these matters the counties and their officers act in behalf of the state, towns and cities, school districts, conservancy districts, and other taxing authorities.

        This undoubtedly carries with it the right when sued to interpose every defense, legal and equitable,

       </p>
       <p>
        The right "to sue" relates to the county's function as a body corporate and can only be exercised within the framework of the specific powers
        granted counties and boards of county commissioners, such does not grant a general power to sue in any and all situations. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Love, 172

        The state is not liable in damages for the negligence of its servants, nor are other governmental corporate entities liable
        for the tortious acts of their servants performing duties in furtherance of a governmental function, as distinguished from a proprietary function. Liber v. Flor, 143

       <p>
        Also the doctrine of respondeat superior applicable to the relation of master and servant does not apply to a public county officer
        so as to render him responsible for the acts or omissions of subordinates whether appointed by him or not, unless he, having the power of selection, has failed to use ordinary care therein, or unless he has been negligent in supervising the acts of such subordinates, or has directed or authorized the wrong.

        But where servants or employees of a county are the actual tort-feasors, and the evidence establishes this fact,
        they should be held liable in all respects as other tort-feasors. Liber v. Flor, 143

        Because counties, not their various subsidiary departments, exist as bodies corporate empowered to sue and be sued,
        naming a county department as a defendant is not an appropriate means of pleading a ยง 1983 action against a county. Stump v. Gates, 777 F. Supp. 808 (D.

        A county does not have blanket authority to deal in real estate.

        And a county has no power to acquire real or personal property as a speculation or an investment,
        nor does it have the power to retain property lawfully acquired for the use of the county when the use therefor no longer exists, and it may acquire and retain such property as it now reasonable needs, or in the foreseeable future may reasonably need, but no more, and such needed property is exempt from taxation, however, other not needed property should be on the tax rolls as provided by law.

       Within the scope of their powers the county commissioners are supreme
       and they cannot be superseded, nor can their acts be judicially controlled or reviewed, except for an excess of jurisdiction or abuse of discretion. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Davis, 27 Colo. App. 501, 150 P. 324 (1915).

       The county commissioners are invested with full and sole power to manage the business affairs of the county.

      </p>
      <p>
       The commissioners are the governing body and by statute they are clothed with full authority to make all contracts
       which are essential to the management of the county affairs. Liggett v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 6 Colo. App. 269, 40 P. 475 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county exercises its power by and through its board of commissioners,
       not through individual members. Nicholl v. E-470 Pub. Highway Auth., 896 P.2d 859 (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The status of counties as corporations has been the subject of considerable discussion,
       and while they are defined as quasi corporations, it is always conceded that as such they have, to the extent of the powers which are conferred upon them, full authority to act and to contract as may corporations generally. Liggett v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 6 Colo. App. 269, 40 P. 475 (1895).
      </p>

      <p>
       Power to buy and build not power to maintain.
       Where the commissioners had the discretionary power to select and purchase a site for a courthouse, and to erect the building thereon, here the power ended, because they had no authority from the general assembly, either express or implied, to bind the public to maintain the courthouse upon the site so selected for all time to come, and the public was not bound by any alleged acts of ratification of the void contract. Colburn v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 15 Colo. App. 90, 61 P. 241 (1900).

      <p>
       Power to contract beyond terms of office.
       Where the officers or trustees of a quasi corporation are empowered to act with reference to any particular matter, it is generally conceded their contract will be valid and binding, even though some part of its performance may be impossible until after the expiration of the term of the officers who may enter into the engagement. Liggett v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 6 Colo. App. 269, 40 P. 475 (1895).

       The board of county commissioners was a proper party and entitled to recover damages against the building contractor and his surety
       under third party beneficiary principles, because in Colorado one may enforce a contractual obligation made for his benefit although he was not a party to the agreement, when such an obligation is apparent from the agreement and the surrounding circumstances. The obligation for the benefit of the county is inherent in the contract documents and circumstances. Under the leasehold agreement, the public building authority's obligation to the county to construct the courthouse building was recognized, and the building plans and specifications were subject to the approval of the county. Under the construction agreement, the county has the right to approve the form of the performance bond. The contractor was not entitled to final payment until completion of the building and final acceptance of work by the authority, the county and the architects. The land belonged to the county and was leased to the authority to have the courthouse built and to lease the land and building back to the county. Thus, the agreements and the circumstances show that the benefit of faithful performance of the construction agreement and the bond were intended to flow to the county. Such contractual benefit to the property owner is enforceable by him. Cox v. Fremont County Pub. Bldg. Auth., 415 F.2d 882 (10th Cir. 1969).

        In discharging their duties, county commissioners are in all relevant aspects the alter egos of the county.

        The general assembly can and does, at times in Colorado, delegate limited police and legislative powers to local governmental units.

       <p>
        Because in Colorado the general assembly, as government has grown more complex, has extended its reliance on boards of county commissioners
        to carry out, on a local level local governmental functions where it has deemed such necessary. Asphalt Paving Co. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 162

        Therefore, in the absence of any constitutional prohibition, there is nothing illegal about a state legislature delegating powers local in nature
        to local governmental units, provided that the proper constitutional tests are met as to maintaining a separation of powers and nonabrogation of proper responsibility. Asphalt Paving Co. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 162

        Counties have been delegated the following powers, among others, each of which requires the board of county commissioners
        to exercise certain police powers, viz.: to license and control dogs; to adopt building regulations and restrictions; to license and regulate public dance halls; to issue liquor licenses; to adopt zoning regulations; to regulate roadside signs on county roads; and to adopt, subject to state approval, lower prima facie speed limits on highways and roads located in unincorporated areas within their boundaries.

        Care for the poor.
        Unless there is some statute which takes from the board the duty of providing for the poor, with the power to make valid contracts for their support, which binds the county, such power is vested in the county board. Saguache v. Tough, 45

        Contract for assessments ultra vires.
        Where board of county commissioners, under its authority to manage the business of the county, entered into a contract with plaintiffs to fix valuations of land, which assessor admittedly was unable to determine, such contract is ultra vires and void, because the right to employ capable assistants comes within the purview of the duties primarily conferred on the assessor and cannot be claimed as an implied power of the board of county commissioners, because the board, as such, has not authority to impose itself upon the express powers of another county officer.

        An action on the official bond of a district court clerk for moneys belonging to a county
        is properly brought in the name of the people of the state of Colorado for the use of the board of county commissioners of the county, and the fact that the county treasurer is the person legally authorized to receive the money does not make it necessary that he should be named as the obligee of the bond, nor that a suit thereon should be brought for his use.

        Effect of 1977 amendment.
        The 1977 amendment, adding subsection (2), gives the county commissioners the authority to make the final budget determination for agencies such as the office of the district attorney which are funded in whole or in part by county appropriations, and establishes a statutory presumption that the board validly exercised its budget-making power.

        Judicial review of discretionary budgetary decisions limited.
        A court's role in reviewing discretionary budgetary decisions by a board of county commissioners is limited to the determination of whether the board abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily or unreasonably. Beacom v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 657 P.2d 440 (Colo. 1983).

        Permissive grants of power that allow the county
        to construct, operate, improve, and extend storm water facilities and levy taxes to finance the acquisition, construction, operation, improvement, and extension thereof, do not impose a mandatory duty to remedy a particular harm and, therefore, do not establish a clear legislative intent to create a private cause of action.

        Trial court properly dismissed petition by county to condemn a portion of owner's property for use as a public road because county presented no valid public purpose for its condemnation of owner's property.
        Here, public purpose is to benefit private parties; a few, select members of the public will gain access to a private cemetery. Such a private benefit does not constitute a valid public purpose. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Kobobel, 176 P.3d 860 (Colo. App. 2007).

        The board is constituted by law the financial representative of the county,
        to whom all unliquidated claims against the county are to be presented for allowance, and no other officer or agent of the county is invested with similar powers, and the presentation of a claim to this board, the allowance of which comes within the scope of its powers, is practically a presentation thereof to the county.

       <p>
        The rule governing the allowance of claims by the board of county commissioners is
        that the authority must be found in the statute, either in express words or by implication, and the compensation for every legitimate charge against a county is not fixed by statute, nor even expressly provided for, it is therefore within the power of the board in such cases to allow reasonable compensation.

        Lease not unconstitutional indebtedness.
        The leasing of a building for county purposes for a monthly rental of $670 for a term of 25 years is not a creation of indebtedness for the aggregate amount of the rentals within the meaning of ยง 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const. Heberer v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 88

        Perpetual maintenance of hospital.
        Nothing in this section authorizes the board of commissioners to enter into an engagement binding the county to forever maintain a hospital, for the benefit of a particular class, because each board must in each year determine for itself what appropriation shall be made for public purposes, and levy the taxes necessary to meet them; and no board is competent to determine these matters for its successors, or limit their action in the exercise of governmental functions.

       In determining its policy and character of construction work to be done under this section, the city acted in its governmental capacity;
       the power so to act is expressly conferred upon the city council, and this authority it could not delegate. City &amp; County of Denver v. Talarico, 99
       <cite class="co_code">

       But in the performance of the ministerial work it is not acting in a governmental capacity and will be held liable
       for damages resulting from its negligence in the construction and maintenance of the works erected in carrying out the policy adopted. City &amp; County of Denver v. Talarico, 99
       <cite class="co_code">

       And in an action against a municipality for damages occasioned by the flooding of plaintiff's lands and crops,
       resulting from the city's negligence in making and leaving an excavation in an embankment through which the flood waters reached his land, it was held that the evidence supported a finding that the excavation was the proximate cause of the damage. City &amp; County of Denver v. Talarico, 99
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 178

       Ordinary care required.
       In an action for damages to land and crops resulting from the alleged negligence of a city, if the latter failed to use ordinary care in maintaining an embankment constructed in line with its policy for flood water control, it cannot escape liability by imputing the cause of damage to an act of God. City &amp; County of Denver v. Talarico, 99
       <cite class="co_code">

       City must see that adjacent land not subject to greater hazard.
       Where city under legislative authority makes improvements in and along the channel of a natural stream, in the absence of contract, it owes no duty to adjacent landowners other than to see that in the plan of the improvement and its maintenance or failure to maintain, such land is not subjected to a greater burden or hazard from floods than that to which it would have been exposed had the stream been left in its natural state.

       In any sale of county lands made by any county acting through its board of county commissioners, a valid reservation of oil and gas and other minerals in such lands may be made when in the opinion of the board of county commissioners it is deemed to be for the best interest of the county. Oil and gas and other mineral rights or any of them thus reserved by a county upon the sale of such real estate may be sold by order of the board of county commissioners at public sale to the highest and best bidder after four weeks' prior notice by publication two times in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the land is situated, said notice to describe the oil and gas or other mineral rights to be sold, the location of the land involved, and the date, time, and place of such sale; but a copy of said notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, by the board of county commissioners to the owner of the surface at the time of such notice as shown by the records in the office of the county assessor of the county in which such lands are situated at the last known address of such owner as shown by said books of the county assessor, and that a copy of said notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, by the board of county commissioners to the person in possession of the surface.

Nothing contained in this section shall prevent a county from selling any number of such units or parcels at any public sale. The board of county commissioners has the right to reject any and all bids.

Any such lease of mineral rights, other than oil and gas, shall be for a term not to exceed twenty-five years and as long thereafter as such minerals are produced. Leases of any such mineral rights made or entered into by the board in conformity with the provisions of this section prior to February 25, 1955, are hereby confirmed, validated, and declared to be legal and valid insofar as the authority of any such board is concerned.

       Placement of statute immaterial.
       That the revisor of statutes placed a statute relating to the authority of counties to reserve mineral rights in county lands sold under the title "County Powers and Functions" rather than under "taxation" is immaterial where the statute provides that the term county lands means any real estate acquired and owned by a county under the laws relating to taxation or otherwise.

Any power, function, service, or facility vested by statute in a particular county officer, agency, or board, including a board of county commissioners, may be exercised or performed within a home rule county by such county officer, agency, or board or by any other county officer, agency, or board designated in the home rule charter. For home rule counties, the term "board of county commissioners" means the governing body of the county designated by the county.

       Whether a private road that begins at a public road, crosses various parcels, and dead-ends on private land may be regulated in its entirety or not at all should be determined by the predominant use of the private land that it crosses. The predominant use of these various parcels may change, which will affect whether, at some point in time, the county can require the entire road to comply with its fire code, although some parcels may still meet the "farm and ranch" exception.

      (I) Community wildfire protection plans, or CWPPs, are authorized and defined in section 101 of Title I of the federal "Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003", Pub.L. 108-148, referred to in this section as "HFRA". Title I of HFRA authorizes the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to expedite the development and implementation of hazardous fuel reduction projects on federal lands managed by the United States forest service and the bureau of land management when these agencies meet certain conditions. HFRA emphasizes the need for federal agencies to work collaboratively with local communities in developing hazardous fuel reduction projects, placing priority on treatment areas identified by the local communities themselves in a CWPP. The wild land-urban interface area is one of the identified property areas that qualify under HFRA for the use of this expedited environmental review process.
     </p>
     <p>
      (II) The development of a CWPP can assist a local community in clarifying and refining its priorities for the protection of life, property, and critical infrastructure in its wildland-urban interface area. The CWPP brings together diverse federal, state, and local interests to discuss their mutual concerns for public safety, community sustainability, and natural resources. The CWPP process offers a positive, solution-oriented environment in which to address challenges such as local fire-fighting capability, the need for defensible space around homes and housing developments, and where and how to prioritize land management on both federal and nonfederal lands. CWPPs can be as simple or complex as a local community desires.

The simplified county court procedures set forth in part 1 of article 2 of title 16, C.R.S., and the penalty assessment procedures set forth in part 2 of said article shall be applicable to the prosecution of violations of county ordinances. Any summons and complaint brought in any county court shall be filed in the name of the county by and on behalf of the people of the state of Colorado. Any process issued from a county court shall be likewise denominated. It is the duty of the sheriff and undersheriff and deputies, in their respective counties, to enforce the provisions of county ordinances.

       Determination and effect of conflict.
       No local government may adopt an ordinance or resolution that is in conflict with a state statute. If it does conflict, the ordinance or resolution is void. However, for a conflict to exist, both the state statute and the local ordinance or resolution must contain express or implied conditions which are inconsistent and irreconcilable one with the other. C &amp; M Sand &amp; Gravel v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 673 P.2d 1013 (Colo. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       County ordinance which purportedly conflicts with a state statute may coexist with such state statute if the ordinance does not have provisions which irreconcilably conflict with state statute,
       but, if there is such a conflict, the state statute preempts the county ordinance. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Martin, 856 P.2d 62 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county ordinance and a state statute may both remain effective and enforceable as long as they do not contain express or implied conditions that are irreconcilably in conflict with each other.

The requirements, however, do not apply to an applicant who is unable to work due to a temporary disability. The board may require verification of a disability by a medical examination. The requirements to search for employment do not apply to persons who are sixty-five years of age and older.

       Any governing body having jurisdiction is authorized to establish a solid wastes disposal site and facility fund. The governing body having jurisdiction may levy a solid wastes disposal site and facility tax, in addition to any other tax authorized by law, on the taxable property within a county or municipality, the proceeds of which shall be deposited to the credit of said fund and appropriated to pay the cost of land, labor, equipment, and services needed in the operation of solid wastes disposal sites and facilities and for any other solid wastes management purpose in or on behalf of that county or municipality. Any governing body having jurisdiction is also authorized, after a public hearing, to fix, modify, and collect service charges from users of solid wastes disposal sites and facilities or transfer stations for the purpose of financing solid wastes management in that county or municipality. In the event that a countywide solid waste disposal site and facility tax has been imposed with the consent of a majority of the voters in the county, that tax may continue to be collected countywide and may accrue to the county's solid waste disposal site and facility fund, notwithstanding any subsequent taxes as may be levied by any municipalities within the county under this section.

       No unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.
       Vesting in the county commissioners authority to acquire, construct, and maintain public projects particularly defined in the act as intended for use in the promotion of the public health is not so broad or vague as to constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.

       The purpose of the general welfare clause in a statute is to extend the powers of a municipality
       beyond those specifically enumerated to other things which are necessary to accomplish the purposes of municipal government. Garel v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 167

       A sewage system is a public necessity, and may be authorized to make all regulations necessary to secure the general health.

Such bonds shall be in such denominations as the board shall determine. Interest coupons, if any, shall bear the original or facsimile signature of the presiding officer of the board. Under no circumstances shall any of said bonds be considered or held to be an indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the counties or municipalities in which the district or any portion thereof is located, and bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part 5 shall contain a statement to that effect.

         In performing its duties under section 20 of article X and section 6 of article XI of the Colorado constitution, the general assembly must balance the interests of controlling public debt, preserving local control, and reasonably restraining most of the growth of government;

        <li id="t30-general-ar20-s30-20-522ol12b">

         A statutory restriction has been imposed on the amount of bonded indebtedness that county public improvement districts can incur with voter approval;

        <li id="t30-general-ar20-s30-20-522ol12d">
         From time to time, changes to such limitations imposed on county public improvement districts are necessary in order to keep these constitutional interests properly balanced in light of changing circumstances;

         By requiring voters to give approval at the county public improvement district level for any weakening of a county public improvement district limit on debt, the voter approval requirement of section 20 (1) of article X of the Colorado constitution is satisfied in a manner achieving a reasonable result through legislative harmonization of constitutional provisions.

In addition, the county clerk and recorder shall file copies of such assessing resolution after its final adoption by the board with the county assessor and the county treasurer.

When so remedied, the same shall take effect as of the date of the original filing, act, or proceeding. If in any court of competent jurisdiction any final assessment made in pursuance of this part 6 is set aside or if for any other reason the board determines it to be necessary to alter any final assessment made pursuant to this part 6, the board, upon notice as required in the making of an original assessment, may make a new assessment in accordance with the provisions of this part 6.

The certificates shall be received and credited at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, on account of the assessments in pursuance of which the sale was made. The certificates may thereafter be sold by the county treasurer at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, and assigned by him to the purchaser in the name of the county. The proceeds of such sale shall be credited to the fund created by resolution for the payment of such assessments respectively.

Such sales shall be after public notice by the county treasurer or the county clerk and recorder to all persons having or claiming any interest in the property to be sold or in the proceeds of such sale by publication of such notice three times, a week apart, in a weekly or daily newspaper of general circulation within the county in which the property is located. Such notice shall describe the property and state the time, place, and manner of receiving bids; except that the time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten days after the last publication.

All moneys collected from such assessments for any improvement shall be applied to the payment of the bonds issued, until payment in full is made of all the bonds, both principal and interest, or to fund or replenish reserve accounts, if any, established to secure the payment of such bonds.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, in order to protect the environment and the public health, there is a special need to address problems created by the disposal of waste tires and the lack of recycling and beneficial use of waste tires. It is the policy of this state to pursue proposals for recycling and other beneficial use of waste tires in lieu of storage or landfill disposal, and, in addition, it is the intent of the general assembly in adopting this part 14 to encourage the development of techniques for resource recovery, recycling, and reuse of waste tires and to provide for the management of waste tires.

       By May 31, 2015, the commission shall promulgate rules for the implementation and enforcement of this part 14. Until the commission promulgates rules to implement and enforce this part 14, the commission's rules in effect on July 1, 2014, governing waste tires continue to apply to the extent that they do not conflict with this part 14.
      </li>
      <li id="t30-general-ar20-s30-20-1401ol13">
       The department shall enforce this part 14 through its enforcement authorities, including those specified in sections  30-20-113 and  30-20-114.

      <li id="t30-general-ar20-s30-20-1401ol14">
       After tires are used for their original intended purpose, they must be used beneficially, recycled, or reused; except that, if authorized by section  30-20-1414 (1)(b), they may be disposed of at a permitted solid waste facility. Because they can be reused, remanufactured, reclaimed, or recycled, waste tires are a recyclable material as defined in section  30-20-101 (4). As recyclable materials, waste tires must be collected, managed, and transported in accordance with the manifest system required by section  30-20-1417 (2) and recycled into tire-derived product, thereby being transformed from a recyclable material into a new product. The department shall consider tires that have been collected under a tire collection program registered pursuant to section  30-20-1411 to have been managed under an approved established tire collection program for purposes of the federal commercial industrial solid waste incinerator rules, 40 CFR part 60 subparts CCCC and DDDD.

      Agricultural crop and livestock producers are constantly faced with the problem of new insects, diseases, depletion of soil fertility, lack of information as to market demands and preferences, and of other distributive practices. Some counties have need for more research work than others. Such counties, if placed in a position to provide for agricultural research work with laboratory facilities, management, and some labor, would be able to cooperate with the technical personnel of the state and federal research agencies and better meet these local demands for research work.

       ANNOTATION
      </h4>
      <p>
       The intent of the former section was concisely stated in the title,
       as "An act to require the affairs of the counties of this state to be conducted from the revenues derived from taxation, and to prevent the expenses of any county from exceeding its revenues", and it must be accepted and enforced as it read, as the courts have no right to add to or take from its plain and positive provisions. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Hampson, 24
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 127
       </cite>
       , 48 P. 1101 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the evident purpose of that section was
       to compel the board in the last quarter of the fiscal year to consider and decide with great care the levy which should be made and the objects to which the moneys which might be realized from it should be put, in other words, the general assembly intended to compel the board of county commissioners to particularize the purposes to which the moneys should be applied, and by this means all subsequent diversion of the public funds to illegal uses because of personal, political, or other considerations, was substantially prevented. Beshoar v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 444, 43 P. 912 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       A record is not always required to render the proceedings of the board of county commissioners binding.
       Mugrage v. People, 26 Colo. App. 27, 141 P. 522 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       And where question arises as to a board's action a liberal discretion should be exercised
       in receiving evidence of the attending circumstances, to aid in ascertaining the real purpose of what is set down. Mugrage v. People, 26 Colo. App. 27, 141 P. 522 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty directory.
       Under the former section, it was the duty of the board to make the levy so that the assessor could certify the tax list and warrant to the treasurer on or before the first of January, but a failure of the commissioners, or the assessor, to do either within the time specified, in no manner affected the taxpayer and was directory. Tallon v. Vindicator Consol. Gold Mining Co., 59
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 316
       </cite>
       , 149 P. 108 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       Treasurer not responsible for omissions of board.
       Where the only resolution of the board which could be termed an appropriation, directed levies upon the taxable property, as follows: "For State Purposes, 4 mills; for County Redemption Fund, 5 mills; for County General Revenue, 10 mills; for Road Fund, 4 mills; for General School Fund, 4 mills -- the same to be extended on the tax roll by the county assessor, and by him certified to the county treasurer for collection.", it was held that warrants regularly issued for unquestioned obligations of the county, and paid by the treasurer were to be credited to him in his account, in spite of the absence of any formal appropriation resolution, such as required by the former section, and that the treasurer shall not be penalized for the omissions of the governing body of the county. Mugrage v. People, 26 Colo. App. 27, 141 P. 522 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       The holder of a valid warrant issued by a city for current expenses of a fiscal year is entitled to be paid out of the revenues
       of that year, appropriated for that purpose, because this is a part of the contract by virtue of the former section, and to hold that his rights thus fixed would be subject to the payment of warrants issued in previous years would impair the obligation of his contract. Ostling v. People ex rel. Bantley, 57
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 22
       </cite>
       , 140 P. 173 (1914).

       Rental payments.
       Where there was no appropriation providing for the rental of a building for county use for 25 years (the full term of the lease), and it was contended that for the reason the lease is void, this contention cannot be upheld, because the rent is to be paid monthly, and it is a current expense and is to be provided for, the same as the other current expenses, by annual levy and appropriation.

       When a judgment is given and rendered against a county of this state in the name of its board of county commissioners or against any county officer in an action prosecuted by or against him in his official capacity or name of office, when the judgment is for money and is a lawful county charge, no execution shall issue thereon, but the same may be paid by the levy of a tax upon the taxable property of said county. When the tax is collected by the county treasurer, it shall be paid over, as fast as collected by him, to the judgment creditor, or his assigns, upon the execution and delivery of proper vouchers therefor; but nothing in this section shall operate to prevent the board of county commissioners from paying any such judgment by a warrant drawn by them upon the ordinary county fund in the county treasury. The power conferred to pay such judgment by a special levy of such tax shall be held to be in addition to the taxing power given and granted to such board to levy taxes for other county purposes. The board of county commissioners shall levy under this law such taxes as shall be sufficient to discharge such judgment in the next fiscal year; but in no event shall such annual levy exceed a total of ten mills for one or more judgments exclusive of mill levies for other county purposes. The board of county commissioners shall continue to levy such taxes, not to exceed a total of ten mills annually, exclusive of mill levies for other county purposes, but in no event less than ten mills if such judgment will not be discharged by a lesser levy until such judgment is discharged.

      <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-s30-25-104ol12">
       Any and all taxes levied to pay the last payment upon or to pay any such judgment shall be valid, whether the sum sought to be raised thereby exceeds the sum due on such judgment, principal and interest or not; but such excess of the sum required shall not exceed a sum equal to ten percent of such required sum, and no sale of real estate made to make such taxes shall be invalid by reason of such excess, if the same is within the above specified limit. All levies to pay judgments shall be made as near as possible to raise a sum equal to that due on the judgment, for which payment the tax is levied; but, nevertheless, any excess levied, if such does not exceed the said ten percent of the sum due and desired to be paid, shall not invalidate any tax levy upon or tax sale of real or personal estate made to raise, make, or collect the said sum due and excess.

       <p>
        Board obligated to act.
        Before a county treasurer is authorized to pay a judgment against the county in either of the ways mentioned in this section the board of county commissioners shall take some action in the matter. Stoddard v. Benton, 6
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 508
        </cite>
        (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is for the board to determine how far the county will defend against the claim
        which has been prosecuted to judgment against it. Stoddard v. Benton, 6
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 508
        </cite>
        (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        And the county commissioners can not be deprived of their option to pay the judgment against the county by a warrant
        drawn on the county fund or of their discretion as to levying a special tax, by a mandamus compelling them to levy a tax to pay the judgment. Bd. of Comm'rs v. King, 67 F. 202 (8th Cir. 1895); Stryker v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 77 F. 567 (8th Cir. 1896); King v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 77 F. 583 (8th Cir. 1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of this section is not to leave it discretionary with the board of commissioners to say whether or not a judgment against a county should ever be paid,
        but should be construed as leaving it to the discretion of the board to pay a judgment either by levying the tax or by warrant drawn on the ordinary county fund, when the judgment can be paid by warrant, but if it cannot be paid by warrant on the ordinary fund the special tax must be levied. People ex rel. Reynolds v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 11 Colo. App. 124, 52 P. 748 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Thus discretion as to the levy of the tax is vested in the board of county commissioners,
        because they are charged with the administration of the affairs of the county, and familiar with its financial resources and its needs and the condition of its taxpayers. Bd. of Comm'rs v. King, 67 F. 202 (8th Cir. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority to issue a warrant at once instead of levying a tax contemplated the presence in the treasury of money applicable to the payment of the judgment,
        and unless there was money in the treasury to meet the warrant its issuance was unauthorized and the board of commissioners had no alternative except to levy the tax, and the warrants thus issued and received by plaintiff constituted no payment of the judgment. People ex rel. Reynolds v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 11 Colo. App. 124, 52 P. 748 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        In all statutes of this description, the word "may" is interpreted to mean "must",
        and the permission is regarded equivalent to a mandate wherever the public interests or the rights of third persons are concerned, the discretion only exists where there are no third parties, either the public or persons, to be injuriously affected by its exercise. People ex rel. Rollins v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 229, 42 P. 1032 (1895).

        II. MANDAMUS TO COMPEL PAYMENT.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Unless forbidden by statute, mandamus lies to compel the levy of taxes to pay judgments against a county.
        Bd. of Comm'rs v. Schradsky, 43
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 84
        </cite>
        , 95 P. 312 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        And when there is no fund in the treasury applicable to the payment of a judgment against a county,
        the judgment creditor is, upon the refusal of the board of county commissioners to levy a tax for the payment of the judgment, entitled to peremptory mandamus to compel them to levy one for that purpose. People ex rel. Rollins v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 229, 42 P. 1032 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        So also in case the commissioners delay, or refuse to make provision for payment of a judgment
        against a county, a writ of mandamus will lie to compel them to act. Stoddard v. Benton, 6
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 508
        </cite>
        (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also the proper proceeding to compel an officer to pay warrants drawn on a special fund
        who refuses to pay, but to make the remedy available, proof must be made that the officer has funds in his hands available for the purpose. Hockaday v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 1 Colo. App. 362, 29 P. 287 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        And a petition for a mandamus is to be construed in the same way and subject to the general rules applied in the construction of an ordinary complaint,
        but the certainty to a certain intent in every particular is no longer a prerequisite. Substantial accuracy is all that is necessary. People ex rel. Rollins v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 229, 42 P. 1032 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Also since the merger of a debt into a judgment changes its form, but not its identity
        when the judgment is presented to a court for affirmative action, and is sought to be collected by a process not contained within itself, the court will look behind the judgment in order to ascertain from the nature of the original claim what method may be adopted for its enforcement. Bd. of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. New Hampshire Sav. Bank, 16 Colo. App. 215, 64 P. 675 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusiveness of judgment.
        In an action for mandamus to compel the board of county commissioners to levy a tax to pay a judgment against a county the judgment is conclusive of all questions which were or might have been litigated in the suit. People ex rel. Reynolds v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 11 Colo. App. 124, 52 P. 748 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        No collateral attack.
        In mandamus proceeding against a board of county commissioners, the judgment must be accepted as a verity, it cannot be collaterally attacked, and it must be assumed to represent an honest debt, regularly contracted, fairly and honestly put into collectible form. People ex rel. Rollins v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 7 Colo. App. 229, 42 P. 1032 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Insufficient cause of action stated.
        In an action of mandamus to compel a board of county commissioners to levy a tax to pay a judgment against the county where the petition shows that the judgment was rendered upon county warrants, the relator must make the same showing that he would have to make if the action had been brought upon the warrants, and unless the petition shows that the board has failed to levy the tax it was required by law to levy to pay such warrants, it fails to state a cause of action, and it is not sufficient to allege that the board has failed and refused to levy a tax to pay the judgment. Bd. of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. New Hampshire Sav. Bank, 16 Colo. App. 215, 64 P. 675 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        When no issue has been made as to the capacity of the county to contract the indebtedness,
        it seems to be doubtful whether a judgment against a county on a void obligation can be enforced in any form. Wilder v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 41 F. 512 (D.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of county commissioners of a county, in consultation with the county treasurer, is authorized to make loans to any governmental entity that is created by or located within the county and that undertakes infrastructure projects within the county. The board of county commissioners shall analyze or cause to be analyzed any such loan using the underwriting standards adopted pursuant to subsection (3) of this section before making the loan, and any such loan is also subject to the following requirements:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-s30-25-106.5ol11a">
         The source of the loan must be legally available money that is not otherwise encumbered or obligated, and the amount loaned must not cause the total outstanding principal balance of all loans made pursuant to this subsection (1) to exceed eight percent of the amount of such money available at the time the loan is made;
        </li>
        <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-s30-25-106.5ol11b">
         The loan must have a specified repayment term, and the loan recipient shall agree to pay the county interest on the loan at an initial rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of return earned on all county financial investments for the twelve months preceding the date on which the loan is made;
        </li>
        <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-s30-25-106.5ol11c">
         The loan recipient shall use loan proceeds for the sole purpose of funding public infrastructure projects, including but not limited to the construction, operation, maintenance, or repair of transportation and recreational infrastructure; and

        <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-s30-25-106.5ol11d">
         The board of county commissioners shall make the loan by entering into an intergovernmental agreement with the loan recipient that establishes the terms and conditions of the loan. Before entering into such an intergovernmental agreement:

          <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-s30-25-106.5ol11dI">
           The board of county commissioners shall approve the public infrastructure project to be funded by the loan and the terms and conditions of the loan at a meeting of the board held in accordance with the open meeting requirements of part 4 of article 6 of title 24; and
          </li>
          <li id="t30-countyfinance-ar25-s30-25-106.5ol11dII">
           The board of county commissioners or the loan recipient shall pursue private sector options, including but not limited to financial institutions doing business within the county, for funding the public infrastructure project to be funded by the loan and report regarding the options pursued at the board meeting held pursuant to subsection (1)(d)(I) of this section.

It is the duty of the board of county commissioners to ensure that all warrants and orders issued on or after April 2, 1998, are drawn upon the proper fund in the treasury and that there are sufficient moneys in said fund. Such warrant or order shall be signed by the chairperson of the board, permanent or temporary, and attested by the county clerk and recorder, and said warrant or order shall specify the amount and value of the claim or service for which it is issued and be numbered and dated in the order in which it is issued.

Whenever there are no moneys in the county treasury of a county to the credit of the proper fund to meet and defray the necessary expenses of the county, it is lawful for the board of county commissioners of such county to provide that county warrants and orders of such county may be drawn and issued against and in anticipation of the collection of taxes already levied for the payment of such expenses to the extent of eighty percent of the total amount of the taxes levied. Warrants and orders so drawn and issued under the provisions of this section shall show upon their faces that they are payable solely from the fund upon which the same are drawn and the taxes levied to form the same when collected and not otherwise.

For purposes of this section, "order" means all orders and authorizations issued by the board of county commissioners for the payment of claims against the county. "Order" includes any check issued by the board of county commissioners and any written authorization issued by the board of county commissioners directing the treasurer to make payment of claims against the county by electronic transfer.

The taxes provided by law therefor shall be credited to said fund until all warrants drawn shall be fully paid, satisfied, and discharged, both principal and interest. Said limited and last-named warrants and orders shall not operate as a debt of said county and shall not be held to add to or increase the debt or indebtedness of said county.

       An objection that a claim against a county was not presented to the board of county commissioners for audit and allowance before suit was brought thereon may be raised for the first time in the supreme court. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Phye, 27
       <cite class="co_code">

       It does not lie with plaintiff, after he sues the county, to say that his claim is not a charge upon the general county fund,
       and therefore not one that the county board can provide for because if he thought the claim was a specific charge upon a special fund created by law and placed in the hands of the county treasurer for liquidating the same, he should not have sued the county, but proceeded directly, in an appropriate action, against the county treasurer.

       An injury to land caused by the county unlawfully entering thereon and constructing a road, is a "claim or demand"

       For the purpose of providing and accumulating moneys for capital expenditures, the board of county commissioners of each county is authorized to create, by resolution, a capital expenditures fund which shall be used solely for capital expenditures. Moneys from any source may be credited to such fund unless otherwise provided by law; except that no moneys dedicated to the payment of general obligation bonds shall be credited to such fund and except that no moneys restricted to county road and bridge funds pursuant to sections  43-2-202 and  43-2-203, C.R.S., and no moneys required to be expended from such funds pursuant to such sections shall be credited to or expended from a capital expenditures fund. Moneys credited to a capital expenditures fund shall not revert to or be transferred to any other fund.

       For the purposes of this section, "capital expenditure" means an expenditure made by a county for long-term additions or betterments, which expenditure, under generally accepted accounting principles, is not properly chargeable as an expense of operation and maintenance. The term includes, but is not limited to, expenditures for the acquisition, development, construction, and renovation of capital facilities, capital projects, and capital equipment.

       In any year, in the course of the preparation and adoption of the county budget pursuant to part 1 of article 1 of title 29, C.R.S., the board of county commissioners may levy a property tax on all taxable real and personal property in the county for the purpose of raising revenue for capital expenditures. Moneys raised from such tax shall be credited to the capital expenditures fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the use of any other moneys which are not contained in the capital expenditures fund from being used for capital expenditures. Nothing in this section shall be construed to violate or to exceed the revenue limitation of part 3 of article 1 of title 29, C.R.S.

Said board shall publish, for the period of at least thirty days immediately preceding such special election, in some newspaper published within such county a notice that such question will be submitted at such election.

       ANNOTATION
      </h4>
      <p>
       The issuance of funding bonds, in exchange for valid warrants, is in no sense the creation of a debt;
       it is but the substitution of new evidence for a preexisting debt, it changes the form, but does not increase the indebtedness. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Standley, 24
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1
       </cite>
       , 49 P. 23 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       Each bond constitutes a separate and independent cause of action against the county,
       and the presumption of its validity goes with it to the end, and must prevail unless it is overcome by a fair preponderance of competent evidence that the warrants for which that particular bond was exchanged evidence unauthorized obligations. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Keene Five-Cents Sav. Bank, 108 F. 505 (8th Cir. 1901); Bd. of Comm'rs v. Standley, 24
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1
       </cite>
       , 49 P. 23 (1897); Bd. of Comm'rs v. Sutliff, 97 F. 270 (8th Cir. 1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Validity of each bond tested by validity of each debt.
       When, in compliance with this section, the county issued a bond in exchange for outstanding valid warrants, its validity could in no way be affected by the fact that other bonds in the same series, issued in exchange for invalid warrants, were unauthorized and void, the validity of each bond, therefore, must be tested by the character of the indebtedness for which it is exchanged, because it is an independent contract, and when issued for preexisting indebtedness, it becomes a valid enforceable obligation against the county. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Standley, 24
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1
       </cite>
       , 49 P. 23 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       Merely because some illegal consideration for some one or more of the bonds of a series may have been given, is not sufficient to invalidate the entire series,
       and though some illegal consideration may have entered into all, or some, of the other bonds of the series than those involved, still unless that taint can be traced into the bonds in question, the county may not escape liability thereon. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Linn, 29
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 446
       </cite>
       , 68 P. 839 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       But bonds issued upon a contract creating indebtedness in excess of the constitutional limitation render the whole series void.
       Bd. of Comm'rs v. Standely, 24
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1
       </cite>
       , 49 P. 23 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumed validity.
       In an action upon coupons the county funding bonds issued under this section, where the defense set up in the answer was that the bonds were invalid because the county warrants for which the bonds were exchanged were issued in excess of the limit of indebtedness allowed by the constitution, when plaintiff produced in evidence his coupons and the bonds to which they were attached, regularly and in due form executed by the authorized officers of the county and with the county seal attached, the presumption was that they were valid, and the same presumption attached to the warrants similarly executed and tested which became merged in the bonds, introduced in evidence by the defendant. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Linn, 29

       Mandamus.
       An action for a money judgment will not lie upon coupons from county refunding bonds, but mandamus is the exclusive remedy, except in certain cases, such as a diversion of the fund, and if the tax has been levied and collected and is in the hands of the treasurer sufficient to pay the coupons the remedy is mandamus against the treasurer to compel payment, also, if the board of county commissioners fails to levy a tax to pay the coupons the remedy is mandamus against the board to compel the levy. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Sims, 31
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasers are charged with notice of the prescribed mode of payment,
       and this method of payment and enforcement of the same is exclusive except, as in case of county warrants, where for some exceptional reason, such as a diversion of the fund, a different procedure may be resorted to. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Sims, 31
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of proof.
       The burden was on defendant to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the alleged indebtedness which was merged in the bonds was invalid because contracted at a time when the county could not lawfully incur further indebtedness. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Linn, 29
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 446

       , 68 P. 839 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action upon county bonds, the fact that the county officers failed to preserve in the public records evidence that the indebtedness on which the bonds were founded was contracted after the constitutional limit had been reached does not absolve the county from the ordinary rules relating to the sufficiency of proof or cast upon plaintiff the burden of showing that the bonds were issued for a valid indebtedness.

       Mandamus.
       Where a county, by an election conducted in substantial conformity to this section, voted to issue bonds as a means of funding its indebtedness, it was held, that the plaintiff, a holder of county warrants constituting a part of such floating debt, was entitled, upon tendering his warrants, and refusal on the part of the county commissioners to issue to him bonds to the amount of such warrants, to a mandamus to compel them to do so.

       Constitutionality.
       Section 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const., providing that any county may contract a debt by loan by the issuance of bonds for the purpose of liquidating the indebtedness incurred prior to December 31, 1886, does not repeal by implication this section, or prevent counties from funding, under it, valid obligations incurred subsequent to said date, viz., December 31, 1886.

       Duty to evaluate vote and amount of indebtedness.
       This section entrusted the power and imposed the duty upon the commissioners to examine, to see and to decide whether or not a favorable vote had been taken, and whether or not the amount of the indebtedness exceeded the limitation, whenever they considered the question of issuing the bonds, and they could not discharge their duty in the issuance of these bonds without a consideration and determination of these questions. Bd. of Comm'rs v. Sutliff, 97 F. 270 (8th Cir. 1899).

       "Roads" defined.
       To restrict the term "roads" to the definition of that term under the conditions of the time, and which had acceptance in the year 1876, when the constitution was adopted, would be most unreasonable, the word has a much broader meaning and may be said to include "overland ways of every character" even though not then envisioned by the framers of the constitution, and the airports of this nation are links in the transportation system, hence runways and landing strips, being a necessary unit of that system, need no longer be regarded as unique or peculiar, hence, they are as logically within the term "roads" as are automobile highways, and the statute authorizing such a bond issue is not unconstitutional.

       Function and duty of planning commission initially is to make and adopt a master plan

       Master plan is advisory only.
       The master plan is only one source of comprehensive planning, and is generally held to be advisory only, and not the equivalent of zoning, nor binding upon the zoning discretion of the legislative body. Theobald v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 644 P.2d 942 (Colo. 1982).

       Conceptually, a master plan is a guide to development rather than an instrument to control land use. Theobald v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 644 P.2d 942 (Colo. 1982).

      <p>
       Planning commission's decisions regarding an amendment to the land use plan are advisory only and legislative in nature. Stuart v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 699 P.2d 978 (Colo. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       And does not confer standing to challenge the plan.
       Considered alone, a master plan is merely advisory and does not affect legally protected interests of property owners so as to confer standing to challenge the plan. Theobald v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 644 P.2d 942 (Colo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       And is implemented through zoning ordinances.
       In order to have a direct effect on property rights, the master plan must be further implemented through zoning, with proper notice and hearing. Theobald v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 644 P.2d 942 (Colo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The master plan embodies policy determination and guiding principles; the zoning ordinances provide the detailed means of giving effect to those principles. Theobald v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 644 P.2d 942 (Colo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Master plan was not used as a guide to future zoning but was used, in effect, to rezone property into a classification in which residences are not permitted. Vick v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 689 P.2d 699 (Colo. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although master plans are generally advisory only,
       a county has the authority to require compliance with a master plan when the county includes compliance with the master plan in its legislatively adopted subdivision regulations so long as the master plan is drafted with sufficient exactitude that proponents of a subdivision are afforded due process, the county does not retain unfettered discretion, and the basis for a county's decision is clear for purposes of a reasoned judicial review. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Conder, 927 P.2d 1339 (Colo. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reference to master plan in land development regulations does not necessarily make the master plan binding.
       A master plan is generally an advisory document, and language in subsection (3)(a) stating that a master plan may be made binding by inclusion in a county's or region's adopted subdivision, zoning, platting, planned unit development, or other similar land development regulations does not mean that including a reference to a master plan in a county's land development regulations necessarily makes the master plan binding in all respects.

       County had authority under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act, article 20 of title 29 (enabling act), to impose temporary moratorium on developmental approvals concerning certain land within county.
       The enabling act is designed to give local governments additional or supplemental powers for the purposes set forth in the act, including development in hazardous areas, protecting wildlife habitats, protecting areas of historical or archeological significance, controlling population density, and providing for the phasing in of infrastructure. These special considerations, in many instances, supplement those normally involved in creating a zoning master plan or administering a zoning regimen.

       Assuming energy conservation is a prerequisite to a finding of reasonableness,
       this assumption does not lead invariably to the conclusion that demand-side alternatives must be taken into account. To the contrary, demand-side alternatives are only one of many possible conservation measures that could be considered. Douglas County Bd. of Comm'rs v. Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 866 P.2d 919 (Colo. 1994).

      30-28-108. Adoption of plan by resolution.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A county or regional planning commission may adopt the county or regional master plan as a whole by a single resolution or, as the work of making the whole master plan progresses, may adopt parts thereof, any such part to correspond generally with one or more of the functional subdivisions of the subject matter which may be included in the plan. The commission may amend, extend, or add to the plan or carry any part of it into greater detail from time to time. The adoption of the plan or any part, amendment, extension, or addition shall be by resolution carried by the affirmative votes of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the commission. The resolution shall refer expressly to the maps and descriptive matter intended by the commission to form the whole or part of the plan. The action taken shall be recorded on the map and descriptive matter by the identifying signature of the secretary of the commission.

       This section deals with the powers and duties of the planning commission.

       Commission may amend, add, or extend plan once adopted and approved.
       Once the master plan is adopted by the commission and approved by the board, the commission then may amend, extend, or add to the plan as time and circumstances dictate. Johnson v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 34 Colo. App. 14, 523 P.2d 159 (1974), aff'd sub nom. Colo. Leisure Prods., Inc. v. Johnson, 187

       , 532 P.2d 742 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this section is applicable to the resolutions of county commissioners on the subject of zoning property.
       Gorden v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 376

       , 382 P.2d 545 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a request for change in zoning originates before the planning commission
       this article contemplates that the question before the county commissioners shall be whether the recommendations of the planning commission shall be approved. Gorden v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 376

      <p>
       A recommendation of the planning commission must be in the form of a resolution which itself identifies the property to be affected.
       Gorden v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 376

       , 382 P.2d 545 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, in the absence of a resolution which identifies the property to be affected, there is nothing properly before the county commissioners
       to be approved or disapproved. Gorden v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       In amending the zoning law, the official or body making the amendment is enacting law, binding on the public,
       and is not merely dealing with the rights of the owners of the particular property affected, and the act is legislative and based on present facts, rather than judicial and dependent on past facts. Gorden v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 376

      <p>
       Municipal ordinance precluded.
       Where a statute, such as this section, authorizes the adoption of zoning regulations by means of resolution, the municipality may not act by way of ordinance; but where the statute requires an ordinance for the attainment of the zoning restriction, a resolution is ineffective to accomplish the desired result. Gorden v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 152

       The pronouncements of the supreme court in cases dealing with zoning ordinances adopted by cities are applicable to the actions of county commissioners

No person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished under this paragraph (a) unless the indictment, information, complaint, or action for the same is instituted prior to the expiration of eighteen months after the recordation or filing in the office of the county clerk and recorder of the instrument transferring or selling such subdivided land. The board of county commissioners may provide for the enforcement of subdivision regulations by means of withholding building permits. No plat for subdivided land shall be approved by the board of county commissioners unless at the time of the approval of platting the subdivider provides the certification of the county treasurer's office that all ad valorem taxes applicable to such subdivided land, for years prior to that year in which approval is granted, have been paid.

       This section creates a problem for the counties in preventing the sales of land where the sale is completed and the deed recorded before the county has had the opportunity to secure an injunction. However, the general assembly has sought to deter violations by making such conduct a misdemeanor. The general assembly apparently determined that this would be an adequate remedy.

       Continuing violation.
       Ordinarily, actual or proposed use itself would constitute "violation" under this section. However, where alleged violation is the failure to secure the approval of the plat by the board, this violation will continue until the board actually approves the plat and, therefore, the board's claim for relief adequately pleaded the necessary facts upon which relief may be granted.

       BOA did not abuse its discretion by not requiring location and extent review prior to approval of mountain roller coaster development.
       Subsection (1)(a) and the regional development code contain a single express exception to the general rule that location and extent review is required only for public projects. The general assembly did not intend to include other privately owned entities, such as parks and recreation facilities, within their reach. Apart from one table in the code, every other indication in the code is that only public projects and (and privately owned utilities) are subject to location and extent review. The BOA concluded as much when it affirmed the staff decision without ordering a location and extent review. That decision was not an abuse of the BOA's discretion or a misunderstanding of the code.

       The county planning commission of any county may, and upon order by the board of county commissioners in any county having a county planning commission shall, make a zoning plan for zoning all or any part of the unincorporated territory within such county, including both the full text of the zoning resolution and the maps, and representing the recommendations of the commission for the regulation by districts or zones of the location, height, bulk, and size of buildings and other structures, percentage of lot which may be occupied, the size of lots, courts, and other open spaces, the density and distribution of population, the location and use of buildings and structures for trade, industry, residence, recreation, public activities, or other purposes, access to sunlight for solar energy devices, and the uses of land for trade, industry, recreation, or other purposes. To the end that adequate safety may be secured, the county planning commission may include in said zoning plan provisions establishing, regulating, and limiting such uses on or along any storm or floodwater runoff channel or basin as such storm or floodwater runoff channel or basin has been designated and approved by the Colorado water conservation board in order to lessen or avoid the hazards to persons and damage to property resulting from the accumulation of storm or floodwaters.

       In Colorado zoning resolutions by counties are authorized by statute which have been held constitutional.

       And the principal constitutional limitation is that zoning provisions must be reasonable and for the promotion of the public welfare,
       this must be determined by the court from the facts, circumstances, and locality in the particular case. Di Salle v. Giggal, 128

       Courts will indulge every intendment in favor of a zoning resolution and that the presumption of constitutionality casts the heavy burden
       upon one who seeks a declaration of invalidity of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the resolution is unconstitutional. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Thompson, 177
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 277

       A zoning plan is presumed to be constitutional, and one challenging such a plan has the burden of demonstrating its unconstitutionality. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Echternacht, 194
       <cite class="co_code">

      <p>
       To sustain an attack upon the validity of a zoning limitation, the aggrieved property owner must show
       that the enforced restriction upon his property will preclude its use for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted, so where the reasonableness of a zoning ordinance is fairly debatable, it must be upheld. Famularo v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 180
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 333
       </cite>
       , 505 P.2d 958 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       And a board of county commissioners, as the legislative body, has a wide prerogative in classifying and regulating uses of land
       for trade, industry, recreation, and other purposes, and it is not the function of the courts to determine how uses shall be defined or what uses shall be permitted in various districts under comprehensive zoning resolutions. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Thompson, 177
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 277
       </cite>
       , 493 P.2d 1358 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, whether one use of land is more or less objectionable than another is for legislative determination
       in classifying land uses in respective zoning districts. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Thompson, 177
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 277

       , 493 P.2d 1358 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       And a zoning ordinance is not to be held unconstitutional because it prohibits the most desirable and convenient use of the land.
       Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Thompson, 177
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 277

      </p>
      <p>
       Nor is a zoning ordinance required to permit most profitable use of land.
       The due process and just compensation clauses of the state and federal constitutions do not require that zoning ordinances permit a landowner to make the most profitable use of his property. For there to be a taking, the landowner must show he has been deprived of all reasonable uses of his land. C.F. Lytle Co. v. Clark, 491 F.2d 834 (10th Cir. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       No denial of due process or equal protection.
       Where land users make no showing that other land users within the same zoning district are permitted to do what they have been denied the right to do, a court finds no denial of due process or equal protection. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Thompson, 177
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 277
       </cite>
       , 493 P.2d 1358 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       And where zoning regulations relating to mineral conservation districts provide for sufficient uses, such uses of land are limited,
       but limitation upon land use is one of the fundamental purposes of zoning necessary to achieve the purposes of the mineral conservation district, and such regulations, on their face, do not amount to a taking of property without due process of law. Famularo v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 180
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 333

       Submission to county board required.
       This section does require the county planning commission, when it formulates a zoning plan or plans, to submit both the full text of the zoning resolution and the maps representing its recommendations to the board of county commissioners. Holly Dev., Inc. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 140

       The fact that the planning department and not the planning commission itself prepared zoning plan does not violate the provision of this section requiring the planning commission to make a zoning plan.

       The regulation of the number of families to a given lot area is of vital importance to the orderly development of a rapidly growing territory
       adjoining a city, particularly for reasons of sanitation therein. Di Salle v. Giggal, 128

       Master plan not binding on zoning discretion.
       The master plan in only one source of comprehensive planning, and is generally held to be advisory only, and not the equivalent of zoning, nor binding upon the zoning discretion of the legislative body. Theobald v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 644 P.2d 942 (Colo. 1982).

       Resubmission not required for nonfundamental changes.
       Where the resolution proposed by the county planning commission was most comprehensive, but it proposed numerous classifications for zoning districts, including five classes of each district, and the board of county commissioners eased the restrictions relating to the location of fur farms, kennels, portable sawmills, and veterinary buildings in an agricultural and forestry district, the change was not so fundamental in nature as to in any wise materially alter the basic overall zoning policy contained in the resolution of the board, and did not necessitate a resubmission of the matter to the commission.

       Notice adequate.
       Where all who appeared for the "first" meeting necessarily learned that the earlier date was incorrect, and presumably, if they made any inquiry, also ascertained that the actual hearing would be held two days later, and the public hearing was exceedingly well attended with about one-half of those persons present opposing with the remaining one-half testifying in support of the resolution, the notice in the instant case was not defective and incorrectly dated notice did not neutralize the "valid" first notice.

       Indirect costs, including, for example, services furnished by county manager, county attorney's office, the assessor's office, and various other divisions of county government may be calculated in determining overall costs required to operate that department for purposes of imposing fees for building department services. Fees generated must generally approximate the overall costs of operating the building department to prevent the fees from constituting an unlawful tax in violation of the state constitutional provision mandating uniform property taxation.

The evidence also supports the finding that the fees charged by the building department were approximately required to offset the direct and indirect costs of operating the department. Mathematical exactitude is not required. Thus, it was permissible for part of the growth costs to be allocated to the building department as indirect costs. Bainbridge, Inc. v.

           The general assembly declares that the establishment of group homes for the aged for the exclusive use of not more than eight persons sixty years of age or older per home is a matter of statewide concern. The general assembly further finds and declares that it is the policy of this state to enable and assist persons sixty years of age or older who do not need nursing facilities and who so elect to live in normal residential surroundings, including single-family residential units. Group homes for the aged shall be distinguished from nursing facilities, as defined in section  25.5-4-103 (14), and institutions providing life care, as defined in section  11-49-101 (6). Every county having adopted or that shall adopt a zoning ordinance shall provide for the location of group homes for the aged. A group home for the aged established under this subsection (2)(b)(II) shall not be located within seven hundred fifty feet of another such group home, unless otherwise provided for by the county.

       Purposes set forth.
       This section sets forth the many purposes for which zoning regulations may be designed and enacted, including not only the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, or welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the state but also, among other purposes, the classification of land uses and distribution of land development and utilization, protection of the tax base, fostering of the state's agricultural and other industries, and the protection of urban and non-urban development.

       Judicial presumption of adequate consideration.

       Delegation of zoning authority to county.
       A delegation of authority is not invalid simply because its terms are broad and general, although there must be sufficient standards and procedural safeguards involved in the delegation and subsequent implementation to ensure than any action taken by a county in response to a land use proposal will be rational and consistent and that judicial review of that action will be available and effective.

      From time to time the board of county commissioners may amend the number, shape, boundaries, or area of any district, or any regulation of or within such district, or any other provisions of the zoning resolution. Any such amendment shall not be made or become effective unless the same has been proposed by or is first submitted for the approval, disapproval, or suggestions of the county planning commission.

       Notice by publication is the law's substitute for personal notice,

       Strict compliance with notice provisions.
       A notice of hearing as the basis of a local ordinance should unambiguously set forth reasonable information concerning the subject matter of the hearing to the end that adequate warning be given to all persons whose rights may be affected by action of the local board, because changes in zoning ordinances affect property rights, and the provisions as to a notice of hearing must be strictly complied with, and a notice which does not warn of the nature of the proposed amendments is no notice.

       Hearing requirement does not give landowner a right to an unlimited hearing with regard to zoning changes.

       Condition precedent.

       Ambiguity resolved against notice.
       Any ambiguity in a notice to the public of an important zoning change, which is the only notice that the public has, should be resolved against the notice. Holly Dev., Inc. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 140

      <p>
       Lay meaning applied to notice.
       When a statute requires a notice to be given to the public, such a notice should fairly be given the meaning it would reflect upon the mind of the ordinary layman, and not as it would be construed by one familiar with the technicalities solely applicable to the laws and rules of the zoning commission, otherwise, such a notice, instead of informing, would actually mislead the public, including the persons immediately interested.

       Factors to be considered in construing ordinance.
       Because zoning laws should be given a fair and reasonable construction in light of the setting in which employed, the factors surrounding adoption of an ordinance should be considered. Wainwright v. City of Wheat Ridge, 38

       As soon as reasonably possible after their adoption, actual changes should be placed upon an authorized copy of an original county zoning map

       Failure to comply with section renders board's proceeding and resolution void.
       Where the amendment which the board enacted was neither proposed by the planning commission nor submitted for commission consideration, although the planning commission provided a recommendation, it was never given an opportunity to pass upon the amendment which the board of county commissioners adopted, the proceedings before the board, as well as the resultant zoning resolution, were null and void.

       Arbitrary or capricious action.

       The board of county commissioners of any county which enacts zoning regulations under the authority of this part 1 shall provide for a board of adjustment of three to five members and for the manner of the appointment of such members. Not more than half of the members of such board may at any time be members of the planning commission. The board of county commissioners shall fix per diem compensation and terms for the members of such board of adjustment, which terms shall be of such length and so arranged that the term of at least one member will expire each year. Any member of the board of adjustment may be removed for cause by the board of county commissioners upon written charges and after a public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as in the case of original appointments. The board of county commissioners may appoint associate members of such board, and, in the event that any regular member is temporarily unable to act owing to absence from the county, illness, interest in a case before the board, or any other cause, his place may be taken during such temporary disability by an associate member designated for that purpose.

       The board of county commissioners shall provide and specify in its zoning or other resolutions general rules to govern the organization, procedure, and jurisdiction of said board of adjustment, which rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this part 1. The board of adjustment may adopt supplemental rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part 1 or such general rules.

       Any zoning resolution of the board of county commissioners may provide that the board of adjustment, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules, conditions, and safeguards set forth in the zoning resolution, may make special exceptions to the terms of the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent. Where feasible, special exception may be made for the purpose of providing access to sunlight for solar energy devices. The board of county commissioners may also authorize the board of adjustment to interpret the zoning maps and pass upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines or similar questions, as they may arise in the administration of the zoning regulations.

       Meetings of the board of adjustment shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board in its rules of procedure may specify. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by application to the district court. The court, upon proper showing, may issue subpoenas and enforce obedience by contempt proceedings. All meetings of the board of adjustment shall be open to the public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.

       A county zoning resolution was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconstitutional
       in that it provided that, if a non-conforming use of land, preserved under this section, was discontinued for one year, any further use of the premises must conform to the provisions of the resolution. Beszedes v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 116

       Conditional use is
       a use which is permitted within the zone, but which because of the possibility that the permitted use could become incompatible in certain respects with other uses within the zone, special permission is required before the land may be put to that use. Elam v. Albers, 44

       Section does not conflict with, preempt, or control necessarily implied authority of a local government under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act (enabling act) to adopt a reasonable moratorium of sufficient duration to prepare a master plan.
       Section pertains to temporary moratoria adopted without a public hearing in connection with the adoption of a zoning plan. This section constitutes an additional grant of authority to local governments in the context of zoning plan adoption: The local government is permitted to adopt a moratorium for a six-month period without a public hearing. Droste v. Bd. of County Comm'rs of Pitkin, 159 P.3d 601 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       County had authority under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act (enabling act) to impose temporary moratorium on developmental approvals concerning certain land within county.
       The enabling act is designed to give the local governments additional or supplemental powers for the purposes set forth in the act, including development in hazardous areas, protecting wildlife habitats, protecting areas of historical or archeological significance, controlling population density, and providing for the phasing in of infrastructure. These special considerations, in many instances, supplement those normally involved in creating a zoning master plan or administering a zoning regimen. Accordingly, the enabling act and this article (county planning statute) have different, though complementary, purposes, and the limitation on temporary zoning authorized by this section does not prohibit or limit a moratorium on development for the purpose of conducting studies under the enabling act. Droste v. Bd. of County Comm'rs of Pitkin, 141 P.3d 852 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 159 P.3d 601 (Colo. 2007).

       It is unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, or use any building, structure, or land in violation of any regulation in, or of any provisions of, any zoning resolution or any amendment thereof, enacted or adopted by the board of county commissioners under the authority of this part 1. In addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to section  30-28-124, any person, firm, or corporation violating any such regulation, provision, or amendment thereof or any provision of this part 1 may be subject to the imposition, by order of the county court, of a civil penalty in an amount of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. It is within the discretion of the county attorney to determine whether to pursue the civil penalties set forth in this section, the remedies set forth in section  30-28-124, or both. Each day after the issuance of the order of the county court during which such unlawful activity continues shall be deemed a separate violation and shall, in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this section, be the subject of a continuing penalty in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars for each such day. Until paid, any civil penalty ordered by the county court and assessed under this subsection (1) shall, as of recording, be a lien against the property on which the violation has been found to exist. In case the assessment is not paid within thirty days, it may be certified by the county attorney to the county treasurer, who shall collect the assessment, together with a ten percent penalty for the cost of collection, in the same manner as other taxes are collected. The laws of this state for assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale and redemption of property for taxes, shall apply to the collection of assessments pursuant to this subsection (1). Any lien placed against the property pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be recorded with the clerk and recorder of the county in which the property is located.

       Board of county commissioners abused its discretion in approving planned unit development because record contains no evidence of year-around access to the state highway system at the time of final approval.
       Plain language of this section does not allow postponing access beyond the application for final subdivision approval. Final approval of a subdivision application predicated on obtaining access to the state highway system by an as yet undetermined route would constitute an abuse of discretion because the subdivision might never have the required statutory access. This section requires at a minimum year-round wheeled vehicle access between state highway and village. Because subject road is not usable by wheeled vehicles during winter, purpose of this section not satisfied. Wolf Creek Ski Corp. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 170 P.3d 821 (Colo. App. 2007).

       Indirect costs, including, for example, services furnished by county manager, county attorney's office, the assessor's office, and various other divisions of county government may be calculated in determining overall costs required to operate that department for purposes of imposing fees for building department services. Fees generated must generally approximate the overall costs of operating the building department to prevent the fees from constituting an unlawful tax in violation of the state constitutional provision mandating uniform property taxation.

       Evidence demonstrated that growth has driven the costs of the county's building department. The evidence also supports the finding that the fees charged by the building department were approximately required to offset the direct and indirect costs of operating the department. Mathematical exactitude is not required. Thus, it was permissible for part of the growth costs to be allocated to the building department as indirect costs. Bainbridge, Inc. v.

       It is unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, maintain, or use any building, structure, or land in violation of this part 2 or any provisions of the area building code. In addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to section  30-28-209, any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this part 2 or any provision of the area building code may be subject to the imposition, by order of the county court, of a civil penalty in an amount of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. It is within the discretion of the county attorney to determine whether to pursue the civil penalties set forth in this section, the remedies set forth in section  30-28-209, or both. Each day after the issuance of the order of the county court during which such unlawful activity continues shall be deemed a separate violation and shall in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this section, be the subject of a continuing penalty in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars for each such day. Until paid, any civil penalty ordered by the county court and assessed under this subsection (1) shall, as of recording, be a lien against the property on which the violation has been found to exist. In case the assessment is not paid within thirty days, it may be certified by the county attorney to the county treasurer, who shall collect the assessment, together with a ten percent penalty for the cost of collection, in the same manner as other taxes are collected. The laws of this state for assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale and redemption of property for taxes, shall apply to the collection of assessments pursuant to this subsection (1).

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, in certain areas of the state, property has been conveyed as irregular parcels or as parcels platted prior to establishment of current subdivision regulations. Situations exist where the physical layout of lots conveyed in this manner are not in dispute, but the legal descriptions of these lots contain inaccuracies such that conflicts exist in the written record locating property boundaries. These conflicts in the legal descriptions jeopardize the ability of property owners to utilize and to convey their property. These conflicts often affect a number of properties such that the most efficient means of correcting them is to create a subdivision exemption plat for the area which can be used as a uniform basis for legal descriptions. The inability of property owners to resolve conflicts in legal descriptions is contrary to the public welfare and interferes with efficient and economic development and utilization of land.

        The board of county commissioners of each county shall have authority within its respective county, for flood control purposes only, to remove or cause to be removed any obstruction to the channel of any natural stream which causes a flood hazard, and for such purpose only the board of county commissioners shall have a right of access to any such natural stream, which access shall be accomplished through existing gates and lanes, if possible. Such authority includes the right to modify existing diversion or storage facilities at no expense to the diverter of a water right, but it shall in no way alter or diminish the quality or quantity of water entitled to be received under any vested water right.

          Upon five days' notice to the landowner and to the owner of any other property or leasehold interest in the area to be inspected, including public utilities, the board of county commissioners shall have a right of access to any natural stream for the purpose of inspecting it and determining if there are obstructions to its channel which create a flood hazard.

          If the board of county commissioners determines that there are obstructions on the property owner's property which in its opinion create a flood hazard, it shall give him written notice of those conditions. Thereafter the board of county commissioners shall negotiate with the owner to reach agreement as to the existence of such conditions and as to the procedures necessary for the elimination thereof. If such agreement is reached, the owner, if he requests, shall be given a reasonable time within which to eliminate such conditions himself, and such agreement may provide for compensation to the owner for such work.

In such court proceedings, it shall be appropriate for the court to consider the necessity for and the reasonableness of the request of the board of county commissioners for access and to award to the owner such payment, if any, as may be proper to compensate him for damages to his property resulting from the flood control work on his property as authorized by the board of county commissioners.

      <li id="t30-homerule-ar35-s30-35-903ol11">
       Such special taxing districts shall be used when a service or level of service which a county is authorized to provide is to be provided in substantially less than the entire area included within the county and where resulting ad valorem taxes or charges may vary from those imposed in other areas within the county.
      </li>
      <li id="t30-homerule-ar35-s30-35-903ol12">
       As long as the service is provided to the included territory, a special taxing district may include, subject to the limitations of section  30-35-103 (2), any territory within a county. The included territory need not be contiguous if the noncontiguous territory is essential to the provision of such services or improvements, and the same territory may lie within more than one special taxing district so long as there is no duplication of services or improvements.

      <li id="t30-homerule-ar35-s30-35-903ol13">
       No tract or parcel of real estate used for manufacturing, mining, railroad, agricultural, or industrial purposes, together with the buildings, improvements, machinery, or equipment or other personal property thereon, for which no direct benefit is provided by the services or improvements of the special taxing district, shall be included therein without the written consent of the owner thereof. If, contrary to the provisions of this subsection (3), any such tract, parcel, or other property thereon is included in any special taxing district, the owner thereof, upon petition to the governing body of the home rule county, shall be entitled to have the same excluded from the special taxing district free and clear of any contract, obligation, lien, or charge to which it might have been liable as a part of the special taxing district.
