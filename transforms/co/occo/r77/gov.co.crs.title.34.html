     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the extraction of mineral resources is a necessary and proper activity and that the achievement of safe and healthful conditions and practices in mines in this state can only be accomplished with the cooperation and coordination of the operators of such mines, the miners who work in the mines, and the state and federal government. The general assembly recognizes that the mining industry is vital to the economy of this state and that the state's mineral and energy resources are of commercial and strategic value to the entire country. The general assembly also recognizes that the efficient development of such resources provides jobs and generates revenues for state and local economies and that such development should be conducted in a manner which protects the health and safety of the miners and of the general public. The general assembly further finds and declares that all mines as defined under federal law are subject to federal regulation. It is the intent of the general assembly to recognize the existence of the federal mine safety laws and to provide a means whereby the state can assist, upon request, mine operators and miners in their attempts to comply with those laws. The general assembly also recognizes that nonproducing mines and mines that are open to the public are not regulated by the federal government. It is the intent of the general assembly to provide an inspection program for such mines to assist in protecting the health and safety of the general public touring such operations. The general assembly hereby recognizes that the "Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977", as amended, Pub.L. 95-164, provides for the proper ventilation of mines and the construction of escapement shafts. The general assembly declares that it is the intent of the general assembly that all mines in the state of Colorado that are subject to said federal law shall comply with said requirements for ventilation and escapement shafts.

Such drifts, tunnels, crosscuts, and entries for the mining and development of coal shall not exceed six hundred sixty feet in length and shall not enter or cross any adjoining or intermediate claims or property which are operated at the time of entry or may reasonably be expected to be operated in the future either as a coal mine or as a part of an operating coal mine.

        because the code regulates reclamation activities as defined by the statute and are the same as those contemplated by the statute.

        Whether an operator has temporarily ceased production is a factual question rather than a legal status conferred by the mined land reclamation board
        for purposes of determining whether the board can approve a second five-year period of temporary cessation without bringing an end to the life of the mine under subsection (6). Consequently, when temporary cessation began no later than 1999 and never resumed, the board could not approve a second five-year period of temporary cessation in 2012. Info. Network v.

        Mining reclamation board and the division of mined land reclamation are definite and distinct entities
        and the designation of the division as a party defendant in lieu of a designation of the board in a challenge to the board's issuance of a mining permit was a failure to join an indispensable party, since the board is an indispensable party to such an action.

        Eligibility for permits.
        Unless the subject land is zoned for mining use or permission for such use is granted by the local government following special use review proceedings, an operator is not eligible to receive a mining permit from the reclamation board.

       </p>
       <p>
        Mining reclamation board and the division of mined land reclamation are definite and distinct entities
        and the designation of the division as a party defendant in lieu of a designation of the board in a challenge to the board's issuance of a mining permit was a failure to join an indispensable party, since the board is an indispensable party to such an action.

        Eligibility for permits.
        Unless the subject land is zoned for mining use or permission for such use is granted by the local government following special use review proceedings, an operator is not eligible to receive a mining permit from the reclamation board.

        Standards applied to modification by board of its decision.
        Unless prohibited by statute, a government licensing agency may modify its decision to grant or transfer a permit to rectify errors or to alter its ruling on the basis of newly discovered evidence, but the modification must be for good cause and it must be within any statutory time limits.

     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of this state that surface coal mining operations and the reclamation of land affected by such operations are both necessary and proper activities. The purpose of this article is to assure that the coal required for local and national energy needs and for economic and social well-being is provided and to provide a balance among the protection of the environment, agricultural productivity, and the need for coal as an essential source of energy. It is the intent of the general assembly by the enactment of this article to allow for the continued development of the surface coal mining operations in this state, while requiring those persons involved in surface coal mining operations to reclaim land affected by such operations as contemporaneously as possible with the surface coal mining operations so that the affected land may be put to a beneficial use. It is the further intent of the general assembly by the enactment of this article to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations, assure that the rights of surface landowners and other persons with a legal interest in the land or appurtenances thereto are fully protected from such operations; assure that surface coal mining operations are not conducted where reclamation as required by this article is not feasible; and to assure that appropriate procedures are provided for the public participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of regulations, standards, reclamation plans, or programs established by the state under this article. It is the further intent of the general assembly to promote the reclamation of mined areas left without adequate reclamation prior to the enactment of this article and which continue, in their unreclaimed condition, to substantially degrade the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public, to aid in the protection of wildlife and aquatic resources, and to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state. It is the intent of the general assembly that, in the administration of this article, the small operator be assisted in complying with the provisions of this article, particularly in the areas of bonding, technical and administrative assistance, and timely processing of permit applications.

         (8) (a) Any operator who violates any permit condition or who violates any other provision of this article may be assessed a civil penalty by the division; except that, if such violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order under subsection (1) or (3) of this section, the civil penalty shall be assessed. Such penalty shall not exceed five thousand dollars for each violation. Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessments.

The settlement agreement shall also require that the penalty, as agreed to, shall be paid within a certain time not to exceed thirty days from the date the agreement is signed by both parties.

      The width of all lode claims located after April 13, 1923, may equal but not exceed three hundred feet on each side of the middle of the vein or crevice, and the owners of any lode claims located before April 13, 1923, and having a lesser width, who are desirous of securing the benefit of this section, may file an additional certificate claiming such additional width as provided in this section, if the additional certificate does not interfere with the existing rights of others at the time of filing of the same.

        Location of the lode was not complete so as to remove it from the public domain.
        Although the claim was located in 1876, the certificate of location removing the lode from the public domain was not recorded until 1880, after the county's declarations of a public road traversing the lode and public use of the road established acceptance of a federal right-of-way grant. Therefore, the road segment on the lode is a public road. Camp Bird

        Construction of section not to be unduly technical.
        The provisions of this section are mandatory and necessary, but they are not to be given a construction so technical as will result in imposing on locators an unnecessary burden, or requirements with which, in many instances, they would be unable to comply. Londonderry Mining Co. v. United Gold Mines Co., 38

        Certificate to help locate claim.
        The purpose of the certificate is to give one seeking the locus of a recorded claim something in the nature of an initial point from which to start, and, following the course or distance given, find with reasonable certainty the claim located. Drummond v. Long, 9
        <cite class="co_code">

        Two insufficient certificates may combine to satisfy section.
        A miner may change the location of his claim so as to include abandoned overlapping claims, or other territory which has not been located, and for this purpose he may file an additional location certificate, and both certificates are admissible in evidence in a traverse suit to show that he has complied with the law, and though neither one as a whole may be absolutely correct and in perfect conformity to this section, yet if from both considered together there may be found all that the law requires, this section being otherwise complied with, the miner's record is complete and his title is perfect.

        Object of requiring reference to natural object or permanent monument is to furnish means by which to identify claim,
        and whatever reference will accomplish this object satisfies the law. Londonderry Mining Co. v. United Gold Mines Co., 38

        Whether or not such reference sufficient deemed question of fact.
        Whether or not there is a reference to a natural object or permanent monument as to satisfy the provisions of the law must necessarily be a question of fact, unless, in the certificate, there is no reference to such an object or monument, or unless, although there is such a reference, it is so indefinite that it can be told from an inspection of the certificate that the claim cannot be identified thereby.

        Satisfactory monuments or markers.
        Stone monuments, blazed trees, the confluence of streams, the point of intersection of well-known gulches, ravines or roads, prominent buttes, hills, mining shafts, etc., are enumerated as satisfying the requirements of this section, as are the permanent monuments of a neighboring mining claim.

        Sufficient description.
        A location certificate of a mining claim which gave the government section in which it was located, and gave the course from which the highest point of a well-known mountain bore from the discovery shaft, the shaft, being 18 feet deep, and then located the surface boundaries on the ground, setting posts at the corners and center of the side lines, the surface boundaries being tied by course and distance to the discovery shaft, contained a sufficient description of the claim to conform to the requirements of this section. Duncan v. Fulton, 15 Colo. App. 140, 61 P. 244 (1900).

       </p>
       <p>
        And there is no difference between references to a patented claim and to one not patented;
        the presumption must be the same in each case. Londonderry Mining Co. v. United Gold Mines Co., 38

        Reference to another claim is prima facie compliance with section.
        Where the description in a location certificate is by metes and bounds beginning at corner No. 1, describing a parallelogram by courses and distances, and concluding by stating, "Corner No. 1 of Wichita lode joining corner No. 4 of Wichita Eagle lode", the reference to the Wichita Eagle lode is a prima facie compliance with this section.

        Sinking second discovery shaft off patented claim is valid location, although no new notice is posted.
        A mining claim was located and all the steps necessary to perfect such location were regular except that the discovery shaft was sunk and notice was posted upon a prior patented claim. Before the intervention of any other rights, the locator learned that his discovery shaft was on patented ground and sank another shaft and discovered mineral on the same vein within 100 feet of the old shaft but clear of the patented claim, and did the necessary discovery and assessment work but did not post any notice at the new discovery shaft nor file any additional certificate of location nor change the boundaries of the original location. It is held that the location was good and valid as against a conflicting claim located subsequent to the second and valid discovery of mineral. Treasury Tunnel, Mining &amp; Reduction Co. v. Boss, 32

       </h5>
       <p>
        Purpose of posting signs.
        One object of the requirement that the discoverer shall, before filing his location certificate, post at the point of discovery a notice is that those wishing to make subsequent locations may thereby be advised of the ground already appropriated, and this serves to hold his ground until his location is perfected within the statutory time.

       <p>
        Notices need not be maintained or replaced.
        It is a well-known fact that the boundaries as marked upon the ground, and the notices thereupon posted, within a very short time often disappear, and there is no requirement in the law that they shall be maintained or replaced by the locator in order to keep his location good.

       <p>
        Notice held sufficient.
        A notice written upon a piece of paper, folded so that no part of the writing appeared, laid upon a stone and held in place by another stone, is sufficient, though no other notice so far as appears was ever posted. Emerson v. Akin, 26 Colo. App. 40, 140 P. 481 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice need not be posted at point of second discovery where location certificate is amended.
        Where a locator of a mining claim made a second and valid discovery of mineral and amended his location certificate so as to base his location on said second discovery, it was not necessary to post notice at the point of second discovery. McMillen v. Ferrum Mining Co., 32

        Designation of permanent monument satisfactory where no public reference point located.

        Filing of one map locating several contiguous claims permitted.
        Where a locator seeks to locate several contiguous claims, the requirements of this section are met by filing one map showing all the claims, along with each group of location certificates, so long as a reasonably intelligent person can locate the claim by reference to the location certificate and the map.

     <p>
      Such surface boundaries shall be marked by six substantial posts hewed or marked on the sides which are in toward the claim, and sunk in the ground, one at each corner and one at the center of each side line. Where it is practically impossible on account of bedrock to sink such posts, they may be placed in a pile of stones, and where in marking the surface boundaries of a claim any one or more of such posts fall by right upon precipitous ground where the proper placing of it is impractical or dangerous to life or limb, it shall be legal and valid to place any such post at the nearest practicable point, suitably marked, to designate the proper place.

       Thus, location of valid mining claim may be leased on underground discovery of mineral
       where the vein has never been opened on the surface. Brewster v. Shoemaker, 28

       Adit may be either open or under cover.
       This section, providing that an adit of at least 10 feet, in along the lode from the point where the lode may be in any manner discovered, shall be equivalent to a discovery shaft, contemplates that as to the 10 feet required it might be either open or under cover, or open in part and under cover in part, dependent upon the nature of the ground. Electro-Magnetic Mining &amp; Dev. Co. v. Van Auken, 9
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 204

       , 11 P. 80 (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is no requirement as to depth of adit
       although it is expressly provided that an open cut, a crosscut, and a tunnel shall cut the lode at a depth of 10 feet below the surface. Gray v. Truby, 6
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 278
       </cite>
       (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       But development must always be such in its dimensions and character as to make it equivalent of discovery shaft
       and bring it substantially within the meaning of the term "adit". Gray v. Truby, 6
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 278
       </cite>
       (1882).

       Notwithstanding provisions of this section, location certificate must correctly describe open cut, shafts, or adit,
       to which it refers. Duncan v. Eagle Rock Gold Mining &amp; Reduction Co., 48

       Intention of this section is to impart notice to third parties.
       And whether or not there is a reference to such a natural object or permanent monument as to satisfy the provisions of the law must necessarily be a question of fact. If by any reasonable construction the language employed in a description will impart notice to subsequent locators, it is sufficient. McNulty v. Kelly, 141

       Location of placer claims is governed first by federal law in 30 U.S.C. §§ 28 and 35; second by this statute,
       if not in conflict with the federal law; and third by court decisions interpreting the statutes. McNulty v. Kelly, 141

       Section applies to all placer claims,

       Colorado law does not permit location without marking the boundaries of the claim on the ground.

      </p>

       Locator of placer in public domain must mark boundaries by stake at each angle,
       although the location be made upon surveyed lands, and according to the subdivisions of a public survey. Saxton v. Perry, 47
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       Conformity of the boundaries of placer claim with lines of government survey,
       by description of a placer location as covering recognized units or subdivisions of such survey, is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this section. Clark v. Pueblo Quarries, 103
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       Placer mining location certificate may contain description of land by section numbers not based upon governmental survey,
       the only requirement being that a description be used that will lead a reasonable man to the claim location. McNulty v. Kelly, 141
       <cite class="co_code">

       Constructive possession.
       In an attempted location of a mining claim in the public domain, if one of the essential requirements of this section is not observed, e.g., the marking of the boundaries, constructive possession is not conferred upon the locator: Neither do improvements made under such invalid location. Saxton v. Perry, 47
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 263
       </cite>
       , 107 P. 281 (1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certificate is not required to show precise boundaries of claim as marked on ground,
       but it is sufficient if it contains directions which, taken in connection with such boundaries, will enable a person of reasonable intelligence to find the claim and trace the lines. McNulty v. Kelly, 141
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 23

       , 346 P.2d 585 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal construction should be given to location certificate,
       and the same should not be declared insufficient unless it clearly fails to identify a claim. McNulty v. Kelly, 141
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 23
       </cite>
       , 346 P.2d 585 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      The relocation of abandoned lode claims shall be by sinking a new discovery shaft and fixing new boundaries in the same manner as if it were the location of a new claim; or the relocator may sink the original discovery shaft ten feet deeper than it was at the time of abandonment, and erect new or adopt the old boundaries, renewing the posts if removed or destroyed.

       Relocation of abandoned mining claim is made in substantially same manner as original location thereof.
       Armstrong v. Lower, 6
       <cite class="co_code">

       Recording claim on territory overlapping abandoned claim not relocation of that claim.
       The surveying, staking, and recording of a location certificate of territory previously located, which overlapped the territory of the abandoned claim, does not constitute a relocation of that claim. Omar v. Soper, 11
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 380

       , 18 P. 443 (1888).

      <p>
       No relocation possible where alleged owners in possession of claim.
       Where defendants were in actual possession of a mining claim, and engaged in developing it, claiming to be the owners, plaintiffs cannot initiate a title thereto by a survey and the recording of a location certificate. Omar v. Soper, 11
       <cite class="co_code">

      <p>
       Abandonment of property question of intention.
       A transaction affecting property may be irregular; but if the owner does not intend to abandon it, and continues in possession, claiming in good faith to be the owner, no abandonment can take place. Omar v. Soper, 11
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 380

       , 18 P. 443 (1888).
      </p>
      <p>
       Original owner cannot perfect relocation after his own delinquency.
       To say that the original locator has the power within himself to make effectual a forfeiture arising from his own delinquency by perfecting a relocation is to place in his hands the extraordinary privilege of holding mineral lands perpetually without doing any of the work whatever.

     <p>
      In trials for the recovery of the value of ore or minerals wrongfully mined and extracted, if plaintiff shows himself entitled to recover, and if he had the rightful possession of the ground from which the ore was taken at the time the action was brought or tried, the fact that defendant may have been in possession, either actual or constructive, when the case was tried shall not deprive plaintiff from recovering damages for the value of the ore or mineral mined and extracted according to the rules of law pertaining to the trials of actions of that character. But for the purpose of the action, plaintiff shall be deemed and held to be in possession of all the ground, drifts, stopes, openings, and premises from which the ore was taken, although he may not be able to reach such ground from his own openings and workings. The rule of law that plaintiff can recover nominal damages for the first entry, and then wait until he obtains actual possession of the ground from which the ore was taken, and then bring another action for the value of the ore or mineral so mined and taken, shall not be observed nor applied to defeat, in the first action, the recovery of the value of the ore or mineral so wrongfully mined and taken.

       This section would appear to create liability without fault arising from pollution of stream with mine tailings,
       whereby damage is suffered by another. Freel v. Ozark-Mahoning Co., 208 F. Supp. 93 (D.

      <p>
       Under this section a miner must take care of his tailings on his own property,
       and evidence of a custom of miners to dump their tailings upon their own grounds, and let them take care of themselves, is insufficient to prevent the issuing of an injunction against the washing down of tailings on plaintiff's claim, where the consent of plaintiff to the acts complained of is not shown. Fuller v. Swan River Placer Mining Co., 12
       <cite class="co_code">

       Joint liability for pollution.
       Where two or more defendants contribute to the pollution of waters of a natural stream, each is responsible for the entire resulting damage even though its separate act might not have caused injury. Wilmore v. Chain O'Mines, Inc., 96

       Although this section furnishes to the surface owner a right in addition to his previous equitable rights, he is not obliged in the first instance to invoke it; but when the owner of the mineral right is willing to, and does, furnish a prescribed bond to save the surface owner harmless, ample relief is afforded to the latter.

       In an action to adjudicate interest in a condemnation award, where the trial court gave recognition to the ownership of the surface of the land in the determination of the value of gravel deposits under the surface, by taking this value into account in determination of the value of the mineral rights, the trial court reached a result consistent with that intended by this section.

       In all actions pending in any district court of this state, wherein the title or right to possession of any mining claims shall be in dispute, the court may, upon application of any of the parties to such action, enter an order for an underground as well as surface survey of such part of the property in dispute as may be necessary to a just determination of the question involved. Such order shall designate some competent surveyor not related to any of the parties to such action, or in any way interested in the result of the same, and, upon the application of the party adverse to such application, the court may also appoint some competent surveyor, to be selected by such adverse applicant, whose duty it is to attend upon such survey and observe the method of making the same, said second surveyor to be at the cost of the party asking therefor.

       It is also lawful in such order to specify the names of witnesses named by either party, not exceeding three on each side, to examine such property, who shall thereupon be allowed to enter into such property and examine the same. The court may also cause the removal of any rock, debris, or other obstacle in any of the drifts or shafts of said property, when such removal is shown to be necessary to a just determination of the question involved. No such order shall be made for survey and inspection except in open court or in chambers, upon notice of application for such order for at least six days, and not then except by agreement of the parties, or upon the affidavit of two or more persons, that such survey and inspection are necessary to the just determination of the action, which affidavits shall state the facts in such case, and wherein the necessity for survey exists, nor shall such order be made unless it appears that the party asking therefor had been refused the privilege of survey and inspection by the adverse party.

The court shall grant an order for the underground inspection and examination of the lode or mines described in the petition. Such order shall designate the number of persons, not exceeding three, besides the plaintiff or his representative, to examine and inspect such lode and mines and take the measurement thereof, relating the amount of water drained from the lode or mine, or the number of fathoms of ground mined and worked out of the lode or mine claimed to have been drained, and the cost of such examination and inspection to be borne by the party applying therefor.

       In order to provide for the payment of the expenses of a drainage system and for the payment of any issue of bonds, the board of supervisors has power to levy and cause to be collected a tax upon all mining claims within the district. Such tax shall be voted only at a regular meeting of the board and shall not exceed in any one year fifty mills on every dollar of valuation as shown by the assessment roll of the county assessor.
      </li>
      <li id="t34-metalmines-ar51-s34-51-117ol12">
       The board of supervisors in lieu of said tax levy upon the valuation for assessment, or in the event such levy will not produce sufficient revenue to meet the payments from time to time accruing upon said bonds and interest thereon and the expenses of the mine drainage district, may order a levy against the net sale price of all ores produced in the mine drainage district, using either in combination, with such division or combination of the tax to be raised as to the board of supervisors seems meet and proper.
      </li>
      <li id="t34-metalmines-ar51-s34-51-117ol13">
       Said tax levy, whether by one or both of said methods, or a combination thereof, shall be voted by said board of supervisors annually and shall be certified to the board of county commissioners of the county wherein said mine drainage district is located on or before the first Monday in November in each year.
      </li>
      <li id="t34-metalmines-ar51-s34-51-117ol14">
       In any mining district where there already exists a drainage tunnel which has lowered the water or drained the district to some ascertained level, there shall be no taxation on the net value of ores under the provisions of this article, in respect to any ore taken out of any portion of any mine above the level now drained by any existing tunnel.
      </li>
      <li id="t34-metalmines-ar51-s34-51-117ol15">
       The additional levy last mentioned shall not exceed ten percent of the net sales price of such ores, and the moneys so levied and collected from said levy on said net sales price shall be used for the payment of bonds and interest thereon and other expenses of the mine drainage district the same as if it had been collected under the tax levy provided in subsection (1) of this section. Said net sales price shall be computed from the gross sales price after deducting the reasonable cost of haulage from the mine to the railroad or smelter or mill, and railroad freight and smelter or other treatment charges in mill or smelter. In order to effectuate the payment of said royalty, said board may order that all such ore so produced and sold from the mine drainage district shall be shipped under such rules and regulations as the board of supervisors may prescribe, either in the name of the board of supervisors, or with notice to the ore purchaser, smelter, or miller that the said ores are subject to the taxation provided in this section.

       The tax on the net sales price of such ores shall be levied against the mine owner or lessor, and against the lessee, sublessee, or other persons having property rights in said ore, and shall be paid by them respectively in the proportion in which they are respectively interested in the net sales price. Said persons respectively shall file with the board of supervisors proper papers to evidence their respective interest in said net sales price, and if such filings are not made then the board of supervisors shall collect said tax against the owner of the property, or against the owner and lessee as their respective interest may appear from any recorded lease or working contract which is on record in the office of the county clerk and recorder of said county at the date of said levy or tax.
      </li>
      <li id="t34-metalmines-ar51-s34-51-117ol18">
       In the event that at the date of said tax there are any valid mining leases on property within the drainage district executed prior to January 30, 1934, said tax shall be apportioned among and paid by the owners, lessors, lessees, or sublessees or other persons in interest in the sale of said ores in the manner provided in subsection (7) of this section. Whenever any such lease or any mining lease is executed after January 30, 1934, and contains a covenant that the lessee shall pay taxes, or general taxes, such covenant shall not be construed to include any special tax authorized by this article; and in such event the mine drainage district taxes shall be apportioned as provided in this section, and said taxes shall not be chargeable against the lessee or sublessee except by express mention of mine drainage district taxes. It is lawful for the parties in interest to contract for and agree among themselves as to their respective liabilities for the mine drainage district taxes, and upon recording such contract or agreement in the office of the county clerk and recorder in the county in which the mine drainage district is situated and serving a copy of said contract or agreement upon the board of supervisors, it is the duty of the board of supervisors to make such orders as will effectuate the division of the tax liability according to the terms of said contract or agreement.

       Colorado's public policy reflects federal public policy.
       The public policy of Colorado regarding the "price and allocation of natural gas" is the policy expressed by congress in the national gas policy act of 1978. Superior Oil Co. v. Western Slope Gas Co., 549 F. Supp. 463 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1982
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Including indefinite price escalation clauses.
       The general assembly apparently intended the entire national gas policy act of 1978, including the sections which allow indefinite price escalation clauses in existing intrastate contracts to operate "according to their terms", to exist as the public policy of Colorado. Superior Oil Co. v. Western Slope Gas Co., 549 F. Supp. 463 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1982
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Favored nations provision in long-term contract for purchase of intrastate gas was not contrary to public policy of Colorado.

       This section requires the commission to foster the development of oil and gas resources, protecting and enforcing the rights of owners and producers,
       and, in so doing, prevent and mitigate significant adverse environmental impacts to the extent necessary to protect public health, safety, and welfare, but only after taking into consideration cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Con. Comm'n v. Martinez, 2019 CO 3, 433 P.3d 22.
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission properly declined to engage in rulemaking
       because it lacked statutory authority to adopt a proposed rule that would prohibit issuance of a well permit if the well would in any way impair the environment, adversely impact human health, or contribute to climate change. The commission was already working with the department of public health and environment to address the concerns to which the proposed rule was directed. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Con. Comm'n v. Martinez, 2019 CO 3, 433 P.3d 22.

       Distinction made in this section between gas produced from gas well and gas produced with oil from oil well is important:
       No provision is made for the flaring of any gas produced from a gas well, but as to a well producing oil, or both oil and gas, the prohibition is only against the flaring of an "excessive or unreasonable amount". Union P. R. R. v. Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 131

Excluding the executive directors from consideration, no more than three members of the commission may be members of the same political party. To the extent possible, consistent with this subsection (2), the members shall be appointed taking into account the need for geographical representation of areas of the state with high levels of current or anticipated oil and gas activity or employment. The appointed members of the commission shall devote their entire time to the duties of their offices to the exclusion of any other employment and are entitled to receive compensation as designated by law.

Examples of conflicts of interest include being registered as a lobbyist at the local or state levels, serving in the general assembly within the prior three years, or serving in an official capacity with an entity that educates or advocates for or against oil and gas activity. This subsection (2)(d) shall be construed reasonably with the objective of disqualifying from the commission any person who might have an immediate conflict of interest or who may not be able to make balanced decisions about oil and gas regulation in Colorado. A person who has worked with or for an energy or environmental entity need not be disqualified if the person's experience shows subject matter knowledge coupled with an ability to render informed, thorough, and balanced decision-making.

      <p>
       This act is a comprehensive statute
       intended to be exclusive means of regulating development, production, and utilization of gas and oil; whether conflict exists between local regulation and statutory scheme is irrelevant in determining validity of local regulation. Oborne v. County Comm'rs of Douglas Cty., 764 P.2d 397 (Colo. App. 1988), cert. denied, 778 P.2d 1370 (Colo. 1989).

       General assembly has power to delegate to commission certain powers and authority
       with reference to the administration of any legislation concerning oil and gas. Union P. R. R. v. Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 131

      <p>
       Rule of commission preempted county regulation
       imposing financial requirements on operators, where county regulation created an operational conflict with the commission's bonding and fine assessment procedures. Gunnison County Bd. of County Comm'rs v. BDS Int'l, LLC, 159 P.3d 773 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       This act preempts a home rule municipality's ban on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) because the ban conflicts with the state's interest in the efficient and responsible development of oil and gas resources.
       Oil and gas development is a matter of mixed state and local concern and, therefore, a home rule municipality's regulation of oil and gas development may coexist with this act only if the regulation does not conflict with the state statute. City of Longmont v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n, 2016 CO 29, 369 P.3d 573.
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal ordinance placing a five-year moratorium on fracking and the storage of fracking waste within city limits
       is preempted by this article on the basis of operational conflict. Fort Collins v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n, 2016 CO 28, 369 P.3d 586.
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission reasonably construed this ambiguous statute
       as not giving it jurisdiction to interpret a contract between a landowner and an operator. Chase v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n,

       Board of county commissioners lacked authority
       to deny application for permit to drill exploratory oil well on basis that applicant refused to meet board's conditions since those conditions covered subjects under exclusive regulatory authority of state oil and gas conservation commission. Oborne v. County Comm'rs of Douglas Cty., 764 P.2d 397 (Colo. App. 1988), cert. denied, 778 P.2d 1370 (Colo. 1989) (decided under law in effect prior to 1986 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff had standing to seek declaratory judgment
       where allegations in complaint, along with other evidence on issue of standing, established that regulatory scheme threatened to cause injury to the plaintiff's present or imminent activities. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Bowen/Edwards Assoc., 830 P.2d 1045 (Colo. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Oil and Gas Conservation Act does not expressly or impliedly preempt
       any and all aspects of a county's authority to enact land-use regulations applicable to oil and gas development and operational activities within the county; although, to the extent that operational conflicts might exist, the county regulations must yield to the state interest. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Bowen/Edwards Assoc., 830 P.2d 1045 (Colo. 1992); Gunnison County Bd. of County Comm'rs v. BDS Int'l, LLC., 159 P.3d 773 (Colo. App. 2006); Ft. Collins v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n, 2016 CO 28, 369 P.3d 586.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operational conflict analysis typically involves a facial evaluation of the respective statutory and regulatory schemes,
       not a factual inquiry as to the effect of those schemes in practice. Ft. Collins v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n, 2016 CO 28, 369 P.3d 586.
      </p>
      <p>
       County regulation requiring oil and gas operators to keep records open for inspection by the county was preempted by this section,
       which excludes the county by omission as an entity authorized to inspect records under subsection (1)(e). Gunnison County Bd. of County Comm'rs v. BDS Int'l, LLC., 159 P.3d 773 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       County regulations pertaining to matters mentioned in this section are not necessarily preempted.
       The trial court erred in holding such regulations facially invalid and, instead, should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the county regulations created an operational conflict with state law. Gunnison County Bd. of County Comm'rs v. BDS Int'l, LLC., 159 P.3d 773 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Federal law does not preempt state or local regulation of oil and gas operations.
       Gunnison County Bd. of County Comm'rs v. BDS Int'l, LLC., 159 P.3d 773 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       State's interest in efficient oil and gas development and production as manifested in the Oil and Gas Conservation Act preempts
       a home-rule city from totally excluding all drilling operations within city limits. Voss v. Lundvall Bros., Inc., 830 P.2d 1061 (Colo. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Oil and Gas Conservation Act does not totally preempt a home-rule city's exercise of land-use authority over oil and gas development and operations within the territorial limits of the city,
       the statewide interest in the efficient development and production of oil and gas resources in a manner calculated to prevent waste, as well as in protecting the correlative rights of owners and producers in a common pool or source to a just and equitable share of the profits of production, prevents a home-rule city from exercising its land-use authority so as to totally ban the drilling of oil, gas, or hydrocarbon wells within the city. Voss v. Lundvall Bros., Inc., 830 P.2d 1061 (Colo. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the local imposition of technical conditions on well drilling where no such conditions are imposed under state regulations and the imposition of penalties, safety regulations, and land restoration requirements that are contrary to those required by state law are preempted due to operational conflict with state law;
       however, the local land use permit requirement does not conflict with state law, as it merely delays but does not prevent oil and gas development, and is explicitly contemplated by statute. Town of Frederick v. N. Am. Res. Co., 60 P.3d 758 (Colo. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       This act preempts a home rule municipality's ban on hydraulic fracturing because the ban conflicts with the state's interest in the efficient and responsible development of oil and gas resources.
       Oil and gas development is a matter of mixed state and local concern and, therefore, a home rule municipality's regulation of oil and gas development may coexist with this act only if the regulation does not conflict with the state statute. City of Longmont v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n, 2016 CO 29, 369 P.3d 573.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the safety and security of oil and gas facilities are subject to regulation by the commission under subsection (11)(a)(II),
       the plain language of subsection (15) prohibits a municipality from imposing a fee to conduct safety and security inspections at oil and gas facilities. Town of Milliken v. Kerr-McGee Oil &amp; Gas,
       <cite class="COA">
        2013 COA 72
       </cite>
       , 410 P.3d 467.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission's regulation that states that permits to drill shall be binding with respect to "any conflicting local governmental permit or land use approval process" is overly broad and void where it conflicts with law
       providing that oil and gas rules preempt county regulations only when the operational effect of the county regulations conflicts with the application of the state oil and gas statute or state regulations. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 81 P.3d 1119 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The normal presumption of validity of a local regulation does not apply to the question of preemption by state law.
       Therefore, the party asserting preemption would not be required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Ft. Collins v. Colo. Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n, 2016 CO 28, 369 P.3d 586.

       Rule that precludes nongovernmental third parties from requesting hearings on permit applications is within commission's authority under subsection (1)(f).

       Any person who believes that he may be an interested party in any proceeding before the commission may file with the commission a request for notices, and thereafter for a period as determined by the commission, not to exceed three years, such person shall be entitled to receive notice by mail of the filing of all petitions upon which a hearing may be held. The filing of a request for notices by a person shall be deemed to be a consent by that person to service of notice by mail at the address shown on the request filed by him in those proceedings in which notice by mail may be given. A request for notices filed under provisions of this subsection (5) may be withdrawn or a new request filed at any time by the person filing the same.

       The commission may act upon its own motion, or upon the petition of any interested person. On the filing of a petition concerning any matter within the jurisdiction of the commission, it shall promptly fix a date for a hearing thereon and shall cause notice of the filing of the petition and of the date for the hearing thereon to be given. Any interested party desiring to protest the granting of the petition shall, at least three days prior to the date of the hearing, file a written protest with the commission, which shall briefly state the basis of the protest. Upon a showing that all interested parties have consented in writing to the granting of the petition without a hearing, the commission may enter an order granting the petition forthwith and without a hearing. In all other cases, the hearing shall be held at the time and place specified in the notice, and all persons who have filed a timely protest shall be given full opportunity to be heard. If no protest to the granting of the petition has been made, the commission may enter an order based upon the facts stated in the verified petition, without the necessity of taking testimony or the making of a record. The commission shall enter its order within thirty days after the hearing. Any person affected by any order of the commission shall have the right at any time to apply to the commission to repeal, amend, modify, or supplement the same.

A party may file an exception to the recommended order; but if no exceptions are filed within twenty days after service upon the parties, or unless the commission stays the recommended order within that time upon its own motion, the recommended order becomes the decision of the commission and subject to section  34-60-111. The commission upon its own motion may, and where exceptions are filed shall, conduct a de novo review of the matter upon the same record, and the recommended order is stayed pending the commission's final determination of the matter. The commission may adopt, reject, or modify the recommended order.

No natural person shall be subject to criminal prosecution or to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which, in spite of his objection, he may be required to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the commission or court, or in obedience to a subpoena; but no person testifying shall be exempted from prosecution and punishment for perjury in the first degree committed in so testifying.

     <p>
      Nothing in this article, and no suit by or against the commission, and no violation charged or asserted against any person under any provisions of this article, or any rule, regulation, or order issued under this article, shall impair, abridge, or delay any cause of action for damages which any person may have or assert against any person violating any provision of this article, or any rule, regulation, or order issued under this article. Any person so damaged by the violation may sue for and recover such damages as he otherwise may be entitled to receive. In the event the commission fails to bring suit to enjoin any actual or threatened violation of this article, or of any rule, regulation, or order made under this article, then any person or party in interest adversely affected and who has notified the commission in writing of such violation or threat thereof and has requested the commission to sue, may, to prevent any or further violation, bring suit for that purpose in the district court of any county in which the commission could have brought suit. If, in such suit, the court holds that injunctive relief should be granted, then the commission shall be made a party and shall be substituted for the person who brought the suit, and the injunction shall be issued as if the commission had at all times been the complaining party.

If the commission is unable to determine, based on the evidence introduced at the hearing, the existence of a pool and the appropriate acreage to be embraced within a drilling unit and the shape thereof, the commission is authorized to establish exploratory drilling units for the purpose of obtaining evidence as to the existence of a pool and the appropriate size and shape of the drilling unit to be applied thereto. In establishing the size and shape of the exploratory drilling unit, the commission may consider, but is not limited to, the size and shape of drilling units previously established by the commission for the same formation in other areas of the same geologic basin. Any spacing regulation made by the commission shall apply to each individual pool separately and not to all units on a statewide basis.

       This statute does not require non-consenting mineral owners to associate for the advancement of oil and gas operators' political beliefs.
       Though forced pooling does require non-consenting mineral owners to interact on some level with oil and gas operators, it does not require them to associate with those operators for the advancement of either party's political beliefs.

       A nonoperating owner has no right to damages for or an injunction against mineral trespass but may drill an offset well or seek a pooling order when the commission had issued an order establishing an 80-acre drilling unit and the order allowed operators to drill another well on an undrilled 40-acre tract if the 80-acre tract is not sufficient to drain the formation.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t34-conservationandregulation-ar60-s34-60-117ol11">
       The commission has authority to prevent waste and protect correlative rights of all owners in every field or pool, and when necessary shall limit the production of oil and gas in any field or pool in the exercise of this authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t34-conservationandregulation-ar60-s34-60-117ol12">
       If the commission limits the total amount of oil or gas which may be produced in any pool in this state to an amount less than that amount which the pool could produce if no restriction were imposed, the commission shall allocate or distribute the allowable production among the several wells or producing properties in the pool on a reasonable basis, preventing or minimizing reasonably avoidable drainage, so that each property will have the opportunity to produce or to receive its just and equitable share, subject to the reasonable necessities for the prevention of waste.
      </li>
      <li id="t34-conservationandregulation-ar60-s34-60-117ol13">
       The commission shall give due regard to the fact that gas produced from oil pools is to be regulated and restricted in a manner as will protect the reasonable use of its energy for oil production.

      <li id="t34-conservationandregulation-ar60-s34-60-117ol14">
       Each person purchasing or taking for transportation oil or gas from any owner or producer shall purchase or take ratably, without discrimination in favor of any owner or producer over any other owner or producer in the same common source of supply offering to sell his oil or gas produced therefrom to such person. If two or more persons purchase or take for transportation oil or gas from any common source of supply in quantities such that any tract of land of separate ownership is not producing its just and equitable share from the pool, the person purchasing or taking from the tract producing more than its just and equitable share shall, upon the proper offer to sell being made, reduce the amount purchased or taken from such tract and purchase from each tract not producing its just and equitable share so that each tract of land may produce its just and equitable share of production from the pool. In the event that any such purchaser or person taking oil or gas for transportation is likewise a producer or owner, he is prohibited from discriminating in favor of his own production or storage, or production or storage in which he may be interested, and his own production and storage shall be treated as that of any other producer or owner; but no owner or producer, who is also a purchaser of oil and gas, or who has a market for his oil and gas or either thereof, has the right to invoke the benefits of this section.

       An agreement for repressuring or pressure maintenance operations, cycling or recycling operations, including the extraction and separation of liquid hydrocarbons from natural gas in connection therewith, or for carrying on any other methods of unit or cooperative development or operation of a field or pool or a part of either, is authorized and may be performed, and shall not be held or construed to violate any statutes relating to trusts, monopolies, or contracts and combinations in restraint of trade, if the agreement is approved by the commission as being in the public interest for conservation or is reasonably necessary to increase ultimate recovery or to prevent waste of oil or gas. Any such agreement entered into prior to July 1, 1951, for any such purpose is approved.

If there is no such agreement, the commission shall determine the relative value, from evidence introduced at the hearing, of the separately owned tracts in the unit area, exclusive of physical equipment, for development of oil and gas by unit operations. The commission shall require the production of or may itself produce such geological, engineering, or other evidence, at the hearing or at any continuance thereof, as may be required to protect the interests of all interested persons.

     <p>
      Any natural gas public utility, having first obtained an order from the commission which has become final, desiring to exercise the right of eminent domain for the purpose of acquiring property for the underground storage of natural gas, shall do so in the manner provided in this article. Such natural gas public utility shall present to the district court of the county wherein the land or some portion thereof is situated a petition setting forth the purpose for which the property is sought to be acquired, a description of the property sought to be appropriated, and the names of the owners of the property as shown by the records of such county. The petitioner shall file the order of the commission as a part of its petition, and no decree or rule by the court granting said petition shall be entered without such order having been filed therewith. The court shall examine said petition and determine whether the petitioner has the power of eminent domain and whether said property is necessary for its lawful purposes, and if found in the affirmative such findings shall be entered in the record. All proceedings under this section shall follow the procedure then in force and effect pertaining to eminent domain.

     <p>
      All natural gas in said underground reservoir, and the rights reasonably necessary for the injection and storage in and withdrawal from said underground reservoir of said natural gas, as defined and limited by the decree of the district court, shall be the property of said natural gas public utility. In no event shall such gas be subject to the right of the owner of the surface of said lands or of any mineral interest therein or of any person other than the public utility, its successors, or its assigns, to produce, take, reduce to possession, or otherwise interfere with or exercise any control over the gas. The right of condemnation granted by this article shall be without prejudice to the rights of the owner of said land or of other rights and interests therein to drill or bore through the underground stratum or formation so appropriated in such manner as to comply with orders, rules, and regulations of the commission issued for the purpose of protecting underground storage, strata, or formations against pollution or against the escape of natural gas therefrom, and shall be without prejudice to the rights of the owner of said lands or other rights or interests therein as to all other uses thereof. The additional cost of complying with such regulations or orders in order to protect the storage shall be paid by the public utility.
