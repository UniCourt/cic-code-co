        <li id="t26-earlychildhoodprogramsandservices-ar01-s26.5-1-402ol11a">
         The most economically efficient time to develop children's skills and social abilities is in the very early years when developmental education across all of the four domains of early learning, family support and education, health care, social-emotional health, and mental health, can have the most effect;
        </li>
        <li id="t26-earlychildhoodprogramsandservices-ar01-s26.5-1-402ol11b">
         Children, families, and society benefit from quality investments in early childhood development and learning. Comprehensive early childhood development provides children and their families with the resources they need for early nurturing and for early language development and learning experiences and the physical health supports they need to help them arrive at school thriving and ready to learn.
        </li>
        <li id="t26-earlychildhoodprogramsandservices-ar01-s26.5-1-402ol11c">
         High-quality early childhood care and learning during the crucial growth years from birth to five years of age is necessary to enable children to succeed when they start kindergarten and as they continue their education;

        <li id="t26-earlychildhoodprogramsandservices-ar01-s26.5-1-402ol11d">
         Research demonstrates that parental support and involvement, combined with a high-quality preschool education program, increases students' school readiness and achievement in kindergarten and significantly contributes to overcoming the effects of students' varying socioeconomic circumstances; and

        <li id="t26-earlychildhoodprogramsandservices-ar01-s26.5-1-402ol11e">

      <li id="t26-earlychildhoodprogramsandservices-ar01-s26.5-1-402ol12">
       The general assembly concludes therefore that it is in the best interests of the state to create a legislative commission to meet on a regular basis throughout the year to study issues and recommend legislation concerning early childhood and school readiness, including health care, mental health, parental involvement, family support, child care, and early learning.
