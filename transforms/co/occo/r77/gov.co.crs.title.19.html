                                                (1.6) The general assembly recognizes the numerous studies establishing that children undergo a critical bonding and attachment process prior to the time they reach six years of age. Such studies further disclose that a child who has not bonded with a
                                                primary adult during this critical stage will suffer significant emotional damage which frequently leads to chronic psychological problems and antisocial behavior when the child reaches adolescence and adulthood.

                                                to enable Colorado to provide enhanced support to children, juveniles, or youth, and their families in order to prevent foster care placements. The state department of human services shall implement the
                                                updated provisions in this title 19 utilizing prevention services and qualified residential treatment programs when the federal government approves Colorado's five-year Title IV-E prevention plan, and subject
                                                to available general fund appropriations or federal funding.

                        The purposes of the Colorado Children's Code are quite different from the purposes of the Criminal Code, and an amendment furthering the purposes of one cannot be deemed invalid on the ground that such legislation is contrary to the purposes of the other.

                            Parent-child relationship constitutionally protected. The parent-child relationship finds protection in both the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment, and parents have a fundamental interest in maintaining this legal relationship
                            with their natural children. Termination of the parent-child relationship divests the parent and the child of all legal rights and obligations with respect to each other. For this reason, the power of the state to sever parental
                            ties should be exercised with extreme caution. People in Interest of E.A., 638 P.2d 278 (Colo. 1981).

                            The Colorado Children's Code defines a "child" as a person under 18 years of age and therefore does not include an "unborn child". When the general assembly amended the definition of child in 1967 and removed the reference to an unborn child, the intent
                            was to change the law and no longer subject an unborn child to the provisions of the Children's Code. People ex rel. H., 74 P.3d 494 (Colo. App. 2003).

                            By its definition of a "delinquent child" the general assembly includes, in its first two categories, only those children who commit acts which, if they were adults, would constitute commission of either a felony or a major misdemeanor. The act of violating
                            a child in need of supervision probation is not remotely comparable to those set forth in the statute. People in Interest of D.R., 29

                            Abuse of siblings may be considered in determining dependency and neglect. In determining the dependency and neglect of a child, evidence that his siblings have been abused may be considered by the trial court as probative of whether the nonabused child

                            Purpose is to secure uniform administration. Jurisdiction vested in the court of the county where the child resides provides uniform administration of the law and uniform protection of all children in the county. Geisler v. People in Interest of Geisler,

                            is purely statutory, it is necessary and essential that the persons thus named shall institute the proceedings. Avery v. County Court, 126

                            General rule. Jurisdiction attaches only in proceedings brought, not in behalf of any person, but solely where children are found delinquent or have been so circumstanced, neglected, or imposed upon as to require the state to take over their custody or
                            act otherwise for their protection. Everett v. Barry, 127

                            Allocation of juvenile and district court jurisdiction in criminal proceedings. Once an indictment charging a class 1 felony is filed, the jurisdiction of the district court is expressly fixed under subsection (4)(b)(I), and that jurisdiction is not lost
                            simply because the juvenile defendant is convicted of a lesser offense. People v. Davenport, 43

                            Juvenile court lacks exclusive jurisdiction where juvenile charged with municipal ordinance violation. A juvenile who could have been charged under the general theft statute but is only charged under a municipal shoplifting ordinance carrying no jail
                            sentence is not a delinquent child and the juvenile court does not have sole and exclusive jurisdiction. Wigent v. Shinsato, 43

                            Juvenile court has power and duty to make such determinations as it deems appropriate regarding custody and care of a child adjudicated to be within its exclusive jurisdiction. City &amp; County of Denver v. Juvenile Court, 182

                            But department of welfare does not. Given the broad power of the juvenile court to make determinations as to the custody and care of a child under its jurisdiction, it would be inconsistent and contrary to the intent of the general assembly to also find
                            such a power in the Denver department of welfare. City &amp; County of Denver v. Juvenile Court, 182

                            And department of welfare is agent of court subject to court's further authority. The court is vested with the ultimate responsibility in the placement of a child for adoption, and thus, whatever authority the welfare department may have concerning custody
                            and/or placement arises as a result of a delegation of that authority by the court. In essence, therefore, the department acts as the agent of the court, assisting in the fulfillment of the court's responsibility. The grant
                            to the welfare department of custody and authority to place for adoption is thus subject to revocation, limitation, or control by the court delegating such authority. People in Interest of M.D.C.M., 34

                            were 18 or older or to ask that the case be remanded to the juvenile court for transfer proceeding under the Colorado Children's Code. Maddox v. People, 178

                            the institution of and during the pendency of a direct proceeding in dependency by the state in the interest of the child in a county court under this section. People ex rel. Lucke v. County Court, 109

                            The jurisdiction of a divorce court is exercised as between a husband and wife; that of a juvenile court in dependency proceedings, as between the state in the interest of the child, and the parents of the child. The two courts may have simultaneous,
                            though not concurrent, jurisdiction concerning the custody of a child. But where both courts make orders concerning such custody, the operation of the order of the divorce court is suspended during the period, and only during
                            the period, that the order of the juvenile court remains in force. Ross v. Ross, 89

                            District court on habeas corpus has no jurisdiction over abandonment. A district court in habeas corpus proceedings has jurisdiction to determine whether a child is being unlawfully restrained by the grandparents. Such determination cannot in any manner

                        State's interest in juvenile proceedings stems from its role as parens patriae, and that interest is of significance both in the context of delinquency cases, and in neglect and dependency matters. McCall v. District Court ex rel. County of Montezuma,

                        In determining whether an indigent parent has the right to appointed counsel in a termination proceeding resulting from a dependency and neglect adjudication, a court is to consider whether (1) the parent's interest is an extremely important one; (2)
                        the state shares with the parent an interest in a correct decision, has a relatively weak pecuniary interest, and, in some but not all cases, has a possibly stronger interest in informal procedures; and (3) the complexity of the
                        proceeding and the incapacity of the uncounselled parent could be, but would not always be, great enough to make the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent's rights insupportably high. In re C.A.O., 192 P.3d 508 (Colo.
                        App. 2008).

                        The decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel for indigent parents in stepparent adoption proceedings must be answered in the first instance by the trial court, subject to appellate review. In re C.A.O., 192 P.3d 508 (Colo. App.

                    <p>
                        Due process requires the appointment of counsel only where the parent's interests are at their strongest, where the state's interests are at their weakest, and where the risks of error are at their peak, and because risk of error was low, state's interest
                        in achieving permanency for children was high, and hearing was not characterized by troublesome points of law, either substantive or procedural, parent's fundamental right to assistance of counsel was not implicated and court was
                        not required to give parent a detailed advisement regarding her decision to appear pro se. C.S. v. People, 83 P.3d 627 (Colo. 2004).

                    <p>
                        In a direct appeal from a judgment terminating parental rights, an appellate court may consider a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel's performance at an adjudicatory hearing only when the party claiming ineffective assistance
                        did not have a full and fair opportunity to assert such a claim immediately after his or her child was adjudicated dependent and neglected. People in Interest of A.R., 2020 CO 10, 456 P.3d 1266.

                        and neglect proceeding, a party must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. People in Interest of A.R., 2020 CO 10, 456

                        Two-stage proceeding before referee and court satisfies due process. Where, in a juvenile case, the procedure involves a two-stage fact-finding process with the first stage conducted by agreement of the parties before a referee with final judgment reserved
                        for the court, it is not violative of the standards of due process and fair treatment. In re People in Interest of J.A.M., 174

                        Actions of court and referee constitute one proceeding. There are not two separate proceedings, one before the referee and a second before the court, but rather one proceeding to pass on the question of possible delinquency. In re People in Interest of

                        Acts of referee dependent on waiver by parties and court confirmation. The essential ingredients to give judicial effect to a referee's findings and recommendations are: (a) A waiver, on the part of all parties, of a request for hearing before a judge,
                        which may be affirmatively stated or may result from a lapse of five days without request; and (b) confirmation of the findings and recommendations by the court. In re People in Interest of J.A.M., 174

                        Final judgment results only after court acts. The findings and recommendations of the referee do not have the effect of a final judgment until adopted or modified by the court. In re People in Interest of J.A.M., 174

                        Final responsibility for disposition lies with trial judge. Since the referee's recommendations do not automatically become the order of the court, and since the court may, even upon its own motion, order a rehearing, the final responsibility for the
                        disposition of the case lies in every instance with the trial judge regardless of whether the parties request review. People in Interest of S.S.T., 38

                        from circumstances that would cause a reasonably careful person to neglect a duty. People ex rel. M.A.M., 167 P.3d 169 (Colo. App. 2007) (decided prior to 2007 repeal of subsection (5)).

                        District court's determination that counsel's misunderstanding of the law did not constitute good cause amounted to a finding that juvenile had not shown "excusable neglect". People ex rel. M.A.M., 167 P.3d 169 (Colo. App. 2007) (decided prior to 2007

                        Allegations of "inexcusable neglect" should be resolved by the district court in the course of determining whether there is good cause to consider juvenile's petition for review, even though there was no excusable neglect to justify its late filing. People

                        Because a district court's review of a magistrate's order is effectively appellate in nature, the factors identified in Estep v. People, 753 P.2d 1241 (Colo. 1988), and People v. Baker, 104 P.3d 893 (Colo. 2005), are equally important when a juvenile's
                        ability to obtain appellate review of a judgment of delinquency entered by a magistrate is foreclosed by counsel's failure to file a timely petition for district court review pursuant to former subsection (5) and should be considered
                        as part of a determination whether there is good cause to permit the late filing of a petition for review. Only after a determination is made that counsel's acts or omissions were inexcusable should the court turn to the Estep-Baker
                        analysis of whether other factors "weigh heavily" in favor of permitting the late filing. People ex rel. M.A.M., 167 P.3d 169 (Colo. App. 2007) (decided prior to 2007 repeal of subsection (5)).

                        the magistrate may believe all or part of the testimony of any witness, he or she may not create a version which is not supported by the testimony of any witness. People in Interest of R.A., 937 P.2d 731 (Colo. 1997).

                        the counsel's medical condition or need for care was so disabling as to prevent counsel from filing the petition or a request for an extension of time. People in Interest of L.B-H-P.,

                        Application of C.A.R. 3.4(b). Based on the "unique circumstances exception", court of appeals has the authority to extend the deadline for filing the notice of appeal in a dependency and neglect case. The "no extensions" provision in C.A.R. 3.4(b) does
                        not preclude application of the unique circumstances exception, because it is an exception to procedural rules limiting a court's authority to grant exceptions. Here, the trial court must bear some responsibility for the late filing
                        because of an ambiguous ruling and subsequent written orders. People ex rel. A.J.H., 134 P.3d 528 (Colo. App. 2006).

                        Party may appeal adjudicatory order after entry of disposition, even though magistrate's dispositional order has not been appealed. Under the plain language of subsection (2)(c), an adjudicatory order is final and appealable upon entry of the disposition.
                        The parties did not appeal the dispositional order, and appeal of the magistrate's dispositional order to the district court is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to appealing the adjudicatory order to the court of appeals or the

                        Matter is moot where guardian ad litem (GAL) failed to offer facts in supplemental brief demonstrating a current basis to terminate mother's parental rights. Although the GAL argued on appeal that the court improperly failed to terminate mother's rights,
                        the child has been returned to the mother and all parties believed that the child should remain in the mother's custody. A matter is moot when the relief sought, if granted, would have no practical legal effect on the existing

                        In dependency and neglect proceeding, GAL appointed for respondent parent with intellectual disability does not have a statutory right to participate in proceedings or to make recommendations to the court. GAL's role is different when representing an
                        adult than when representing a child. The role is assistive: to facilitate communication between the parent and parent's counsel and to help parent participate in the proceeding. People in Interest of T.M.S.,

                        GAL improperly participated when she purported to represent parent's best interests while advocating terminating parental rights, against parent's legal interest and over parent's objection. People in Interest of T.M.S.,

                        Period of appointment of GAL. A GAL appointed with respect to a motion to terminate the parent-child relationship serves until entry of a final decree of adoption or until the juvenile court jurisdiction is terminated. People in Interest of M.C.P., 768

                        Father did not waive his right to the appointment of a GAL when he did not appear in court. Because father was in custody out of state, unrepresented, and indigent, he could not appear in court. Nothing prohibits such an appointment should a parent fail
                        to appear. In re R.L.S.,

                        Court erred in appointing GAL to assist parent and then allowing GAL to testify against parent in closing arguments, violating parent's right to fundamentally fair procedures in termination proceeding. GAL had no right to present closing argument or to
                        make recommendations based on independent observations not in evidence. People in Interest of T.M.S.,

                                reasonable efforts have been made to return the child to a safe home or whether the child should be permanently removed from his or her home. If the court makes such findings, it shall enter a decree ordering the child's
                                placement out of the home in the facility or setting that most appropriately meets the needs of the child, the family, and the community. In making its decision as to proper placement, the court shall utilize the evaluation

                                placement in a facility located in Colorado that can provide appropriate treatment and that will accept the child, then the court shall not place the child in a facility outside this state. If the court deviates from the

                                make specific findings of fact relating to its decision, including the monthly cost of the placement, if ordered. A copy of such findings shall be sent to the chief justice of the Colorado supreme court, who shall report
                                annually to the joint budget committee and the health and human services committees of the house of representatives and senate of the general assembly, or any successor committees, on such orders. If the court commits the

                                placement is not necessary and is not in the best interest of the child, the family, and the community, the court shall dismiss the petition for review of need for placement and shall order that the child be returned home.
                                The court may require a continued hearing of the petition for review of need for placement for a period not to exceed fourteen days if it finds that the materials submitted are insufficient to make a finding as provided

                        void, and the full hearing accorded guardians in habeas corpus proceedings did not cure the infirmity which resulted from the failure of the juvenile court to give the guardians notice of the petition. Woodson v. Ingram, 173

                        Parent awarded custody acts as representative of state. Upon adjudication of dependency, the child may be committed to a state institution. If it is assigned to a parent, the parent acts not as such, but as a representative of the state, and is subject
                        to visitation or inspection. The court may require reports as to the care and training of the child, as well as of ability to care for it; and the court may impose conditions for the care of the child. In re People in Interest

                        Loss of physical custody pursuant to marriage dissolution may terminate custodial duties. A person who initiates a dependency or neglect action and obtains legal custody of a child need not continue to serve as legal custodian and provide support after
                        losing physical custody of the child in a dissolution of marriage action. People in Interest of P.D., 41

                    <p>
                        This section not unconstitutional on its face. This section may be construed to embody the protections required by Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000). The court read this section as requiring that the biological
                        parent's decisions concerning grandparent visitation must carry special weight and significance in the adjudication of the grandparent's visitation petition. The burden of proof must be such that the parent need not prove that
                        the grandparent visitation would adversely affect the child. In re C.M., 74 P.3d 342 (Colo. App. 2002); In re R.A., 66 P.3d 146 (Colo. App. 2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section does not violate due process clause of the United States Constitution merely because it authorizes visitation rights for grandparents. In re M.G., 58 P.3d 1145 (Colo. App. 2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due process does not require a showing of parental unfitness prior to applying the best interest of the child standard to determine custody of a child. In re R.A., 66 P.3d 146 (Colo. App. 2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adoptive parents not similarly situated to biological parents for purposes of an equal protection analysis when determining the threshold circumstances under which grandparents could be permitted to seek court-enforced visitation rights. In re Petition
                        of R.A., 66 P.3d 146 (Colo. App. 2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The wishes of adoptive parents should be given "special significance" like those of biological parents in determining the merits of a grandparents' visitation request, since the intent underlying the adoption statutes is to place the adopted child in
                        the same position as the natural child and, correspondingly, bestow upon the adoptive parents the same rights and duties of natural parents. In re Petition of R.A., 121 P.3d 295 (Colo. App. 2005), rev'd on other grounds sub nom.
                        In re Adoption of C.A., 137 P.3d 318 (Colo. 2006).

                        Appropriate standard for issuance of an order of grandparent visitation requires:

                        <li id="t19-ar01-s19-1-117-annotationol11">
                            A presumption in favor of the parental visitation determination; (2) to rebut this presumption, a showing by grandparents through clear and convincing evidence that the parental determination is not in the child's best interests; and (3) placement of
                            the ultimate burden on grandparents to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the visitation they seek is in the best interests of the child. In re Adoption of C.A., 137 P.3d 318 (Colo. 2006).

                    <p>
                        In applying the best interest of the child standard in grandparent visitation petitions, the court must, if it orders grandparent visitation, make findings of fact and conclusions of law identifying those "special factors" upon which it relied. In re
                        Adoption of C.A., 137 P.3d 318 (Colo. 2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Colorado statute is construed to contain a presumption that parental determinations about grandparent visitation are in the child's best interest. This is a rebuttable presumption, however, when the grandparent presents clear and convincing evidence that
                        the parent is either unfit to make the grandparent visitation determination or that the grandparent visitation decision made by the parent is not in the best interests of the child. In re Adoption of C.A., 137 P.3d 318 (Colo. 2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grandparent bears same burden of proof in resisting subsequent motion to terminate grandparent visitation as in seeking initial order for grandparent visitation. Mother and adoptive father, as movants, have burden to present some evidence of a material
                        change in circumstances affecting the child's best interests to support their motion to terminate grandparent visitation, and the marriage of the mother, the adoption of the child by stepfather, the reports of the child's therapist,
                        and evidence of the child's difficulties in school met this burden. Grandparent must then rebut the presumption, by clear and convincing evidence, that mother's request to terminate visitation is in the best interests of the child.
                        In re A.M., 251 P.3d 1119 (Colo. App. 2010).

                    <p>
                        Nonparent need not show demonstrated harm to child to satisfy "special weight" accorded to parental determinations. In re Adoption of C.A., 137 P.3d 318 (Colo. 2006); In re Reese, 227 P.3d 900 (Colo. App. 2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court correctly determined that the filing requirement set forth in this section did not affect the court's subject matter jurisdiction; instead, this section is a venue provision and, as such, is subject to waiver. In re Villalva, 56 P.3d 1214
                        (Colo. App. 2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hearing required if custodial parent requests. Subsection (2) requires the trial court to hold a hearing if the custodial parent so requests. In re Seright, 649 P.2d 730 (Colo. App. 1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Filing of an opposing affidavit is not a condition precedent to the exercise of the right to require the holding of such a hearing. In re Seright, 649 P.2d 730 (Colo. App. 1982).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grandmother lacked standing on the sole basis that the children did not reside with their father, who was never married to the children's mother, as the plain meaning of this section does not authorize the court to hear grandmother's petition unless there
                        has been a judicial intervention into the marriage of the children's parents, a judicial placement of the children outside their family, or the death of the grandparent's child. In re D.C., 116 P.3d 1251 (Colo. App. 2005).

                    <p>
                        A paternity proceeding is a "child custody case" within the meaning of this section and, therefore, grants grandparent standing to seek visitation under the statute. Although paternity actions are not enumerated in this section, the statute has been construed
                        to include paternity actions within its definition of a child custody case. In re K.L.O-V., 151 P.3d 637 (Colo. App. 2006).

                        Mother may make determinations about the level of contact her children have with her own family without fear of court intervention when the children are in the care and custody of their mother, grandmother's daughter, and there has been no prior court

                        Visitation is primarily a right of the child and only secondarily a right of the visiting party. Conditions on visitation are within the sound discretion of the trial court, taking the best interests of the child into consideration. In re Oswald, 847

                        Because trial court made no findings concerning child's best interests, did not accord special weight to mother's visitation proposal nor address whether mother's proposal would fail to meet the child's interests, and made no findings supporting its order
                        allowing grandparent to take child to Wyoming over mother's objections, the visitation issue must be redetermined. In re C.M., 74 P.3d 342 (Colo. App. 2002).

                        The presumption giving custodial preference to biological parent need not be accorded to a legal guardian. In re M.G., 58 P.3d 1145 (Colo. App. 2002).

                        No irreconcilable conflict between subsections (1)(b) and (1)(c). The so-called "adoption exclusion" in subsection (1)(b) has been construed to apply only when a child becomes available for adoption because the natural parents' rights have been legally
                        terminated. Thus, subsection (1)(b) creates an interim statutory right in favor of grandparents to visit grandchildren until placement of the child for adoption or entry of a final decree of adoption. Under subsection (1)(c), a
                        grandparent may seek visitation even after an adoption if a parent is deceased. In re R.A., 66 P.3d 146 (Colo. App. 2002).

                    <p>
                        Grandparents' visitation rights not subject to exclusion under subsection (1)(b). Exclusionary statutory phrase concerning a child for whom adoption is pending or final pertains only to situations in which legal custody is vested in someone other than
                        child's natural parents or in which child is place out of the natural parents' home. In re Aragon, 764 P.2d 419 (Colo. App. 1988).

                        Grandparents' visitation rights not automatically terminated by adoption of child by natural parent's new spouse. Paternal grandparents' right to visitation with grandchild after dissolution of parents' marriage was not automatically divested when child
                        was subsequently adopted by mother's new spouse. In re Aragon, 764 P.2d 419 (Colo. App. 1988).

                        Grandparents' visitation rights automatically terminate upon completion of adoption, regardless of whether adoption is by strangers or a natural relative. Thus, paternal grandparents' visitation rights terminated upon completion of adoption by maternal
                        grandparents. People in Interest of N.S., 821 P.2d 931 (Colo. App. 1991).

                        An administrative paternity proceeding is a child custody case within the meaning of subsection (1). People in Interest of A.M.B., 946 P.2d 607 (Colo. App. 1997).

                    <p>
                        A paternity proceeding is a "child custody case" within the meaning of this section and, therefore, grants grandparent standing to seek visitation under the statute. Although paternity actions are not enumerated in this section, the statute has been construed
                        to include paternity actions within its definition of a child custody case. In re K.L.O-V., 151 P.3d 637 (Colo. App. 2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section does not confer an unconditional right to intervene in a paternity action under C.R.C.P. 24(a)(1) or as of right under 24(a)(2). Because the statute requires a grandparent to rebut the presumption that the parent's decision regarding visitation
                        is in the child's best interest, it does not give rise to an absolute right to visitation. Because the statute does not vest a grandparent with an absolute right to visitation and issues concerning grandparent visitation are not
                        inherent in a paternity action, there is no absolute or unconditional right for a grandparent to intervene in a paternity action. In re K.L.O-V., 151 P.3d 637 (Colo. App. 2006).

                        Subsection (3) does not authorize court to award attorney fees in all requests for grandparent visitation. Subsection (3) does not apply to initial requests for visitation; rather, it applies only when visitation rights have been established in a prior
                        dissolution proceeding. In re Gallegos, 251 P.3d 1086 (Colo. App. 2010).

                        A grandparent can possess visitation rights. Although the visitation rights of a grandparent are more limited than those of parents, they are still recognized by Colorado law. A limited right remains a right. Thus, a Colorado state court order of visitation
                        rights vests a maternal grandmother with "parental rights" under the plain language of the federal International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act (IPKCA). Further, a grandparent with joint custody or sole custody as defined by state
                        law also has "parental rights" under the IPKCA. U.S. v. Alahmad, 28 F. Supp. 2d 1273 (D.

                        Reasonable grounds to believe that a child is an Indian child must depend upon the totality of the circumstances. In light of the purpose of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), however, to permit tribal involvement in child-custody determinations
                        whenever tribal members are involved, the threshold requirement for notice is clearly not intended to be high. B.H. v. People ex rel. X.H., 138 P.3d 299 (Colo. 2006).

                        Even if a trial court inquires at an initial temporary custody hearing at the commencement of a dependency and neglect proceeding whether there is a reason to know that the child is an Indian child, it must make another inquiry when termination is sought
                        if the court has not already identified the child as an Indian child and the petitioning party has not disclosed what efforts it has made to determine if the child is an Indian child. People in Interest of C.A.,

                        Where caseworker knew that child would be able to enroll in a tribe if mother enrolled, this knowledge is sufficient to warrant notice to the tribe of a motion to terminate parental rights. The state's obligation to notify potentially concerned tribes
                        necessarily arises prior to an ultimate determination of the child's Indian status. As long as there is sufficiently reliable information of virtually any criteria on which membership might be based, there is adequate information
                        to trigger the notice provisions of the federal ICWA. People ex rel. S.R.M., 153 P.3d 438 (Colo. App. 2006).

                        Department of human services must file notices or return receipt cards with the court even if the status of the minor child as an Indian child pursuant to the federal ICWA is undetermined. Failure to file notices or return receipts was not harmless error
                        because department had relevant facts about the child, and it was not possible to determine from the record whether those facts were shared with the tribe. People ex rel. N.D.C., 210 P.3d 494 (Colo. App. 2009).

                        The federal ICWA does not set forth any different standard of proof for an adjudicatory hearing in a dependency and neglect proceeding. The state need only prove the allegations set forth in the petition by a preponderance of the evidence in all adjudications,

                        Trial court erred in using the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in termination hearing because, on the date of the termination hearing, the court could not conclude that the child was an Indian child within the meaning of the federal ICWA.
                        More than 10 days had passed since notice was made to tribes and at least two tribes had responded that the child was not eligible for enrollment. Further, no tribe indicated the child was an Indian child. Although mother provided
                        the department with the child's grandfather's death certificate, and the department had the obligation to make continuing efforts to determine whether the child is an Indian child, the mother should have sought a continuance to
                        require the department to send proper notice based upon information in its possession. Because no tribe responded within the statutory time frame stating that the child was an Indian child within the meaning of the federal ICWA,
                        the trial court was required to apply the clear and convincing burden of proof at the termination hearing. People ex rel. L.O.L., 197 P.3d 291 (Colo. App. 2008).

                        Juvenile court erred in denying tribe's motion to transfer jurisdiction and entertaining former foster parents' opposition to the transfer. Plain language of the Children's Code applies transfer of jurisdiction requests to pre-adoptive and adoptive placement
                        proceedings and places burden of proof on the party opposing transfer, who in this case lacked standing to oppose motion. People in Interest of L.R.B.,

                                Furthermore, the general assembly specifically finds that schools, school districts, and criminal justice agencies attempting to protect children and the public are often frustrated by their lack of ability to exchange information concerning disruptive
                                children who may have experienced disciplinary actions at school or whose actions outside of a school setting may have resulted in contact with local law enforcement. The general assembly finds that schools, school districts,
                                and criminal justice agencies are often better able to assist such disruptive children and to preserve school safety when they are equipped with knowledge concerning a child's history and experiences. The general assembly,
                                however, recognizes that any such sharing of information among and between schools, school districts, and agencies to promote school safety or otherwise to assist disruptive children mandates an awareness of the responsibility
                                on the part of those schools, school districts, and agencies receiving or providing the information that it be used only for its intended and limited purpose as authorized by law and that the confidential nature of the
                                information be preserved. The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is desirable to authorize and encourage open communication among appropriate agencies, including criminal justice agencies, assessment centers for
                                children, school districts, and schools, in order to assist disruptive children and to maintain safe schools.

                                The general assembly further finds that partners in multi-agency assessment centers for children are often frustrated by their lack of ability to exchange information with each other when attempting to serve children and the public. The general assembly
                                finds that assessment centers for children are better able to assist children when they are equipped with knowledge concerning a child's history and experiences. The general assembly, however, recognizes that any such sharing
                                of information among agencies who are part of a multi-agency assessment center for children mandates an awareness of the responsibility on the part of the agencies receiving or providing the information that it be used

                                The general assembly recognizes the importance of children receiving support from all responsible parties and further finds that the state child support enforcement agency and the delegate child support enforcement units have a need to exchange information
                                with other state, federal, and local agencies in order to effectively locate responsible parties; establish paternity and child support, including child support debt pursuant to section 14-14-104, C.R.S.; enforce support
                                orders; disburse collected child support payments; and facilitate the efficient and effective delivery of services under articles 13 and 13.5 of title 26, C.R.S. Therefore, the general assembly recognizes that the state
                                child support enforcement agency and the delegate child support enforcement units need access to the records and databases of the judicial department, the contents of which are otherwise protected under the provisions of
                                this part 3. The general assembly, however, recognizes that any such information sharing mandates an awareness of responsibility on the part of the state child support enforcement agency and the delegate child support enforcement
                                units receiving information that it be used only for its intended purposes as authorized by law and in accordance with the provisions of section 26-13-102.7, C.R.S., and that the confidential nature of the information be

                                protection. Because the population of this state is transitory, and jurisdictional lines for the purpose of court actions are arbitrary, communication of certain information available electronically on a statewide basis
                                may assist state and county agencies, attorneys representing state or county agencies, and attorneys appointed by the court in making recommendations to the court. The general assembly recognizes that any such sharing of
                                information among agencies, attorneys representing agencies, and attorneys appointed by the court mandates an awareness of the responsibility on the part of these agencies, attorneys representing agencies, and attorneys

                        Subsection (2) does not provide equal access to social services records in a criminal case. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).

                    <p>
                        Subsection (2)(f) limits defendant's access to items that the trial court, after an in camera review, determines necessary for the resolution of an issue. Therefore, defendant cannot expect automatic disclosure of records within the possession and control
                        of prosecuting attorney. Instead, defendant must request an in camera review, identify the information sought, and explain why disclosure is necessary for resolution of an issue. To achieve the broadest possible disclosure, defendant
                        should explain the relevance and materiality of the information sought. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).

                    <p>
                        Prosecutor has full access to records while investigating a report of known or suspected incident of child abuse or neglect. Subsection (2)(f) does not suspend prosecutor's obligation to disclose information that is materially favorable to defendant.
                        However, that duty to disclose is still subject to the in camera review process in subsection (2)(f). Therefore, if the prosecutor believes a social services record contains information it must disclose, the prosecutor must ask
                        the trial court to conduct an in camera review of the information to determine if disclosure is necessary for the resolution of an issue. If the trial court determines the information is necessary then it is disclosed to the defendant.
                        The prosecutor does not have the right to offer the material into evidence without first obtaining the trial court's approval. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (2)(f) places the trial court in the middle of a procedural issue that normally would have been handled by counsel through the automatic disclosure requirements of Crim. P. 16(I)(a)(1). The trial court must review the records to determine whether
                        the records are necessary for the resolution of an issue. Although the determination of whether the records should be disclosed must be made on case-specific circumstances, there are three principles that apply generally. First,
                        under due process considerations, the trial court must disclose any information that is materially favorable to defendant because it is either exculpatory or impeaching. Second, the trial court should disclose inculpatory information
                        when the information would materially assist in preparing the defense. Finally, it may be significant, although not determinative, that the information would be otherwise subject to automatic disclosure under Crim. P. 16(I)(a)(1).

                    <p>
                        Defendant received adequate discovery of department of social services records. Subsection (2)(f) prohibits defendant from having the same direct access the prosecution has to the records. Moreover, trial court does not have an obligation through the
                        in camera review to provide defendant all of the records, only those that are necessary for determination of an issue. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).

                        Trial court erred in not disclosing report from department of social services file, but error was not prejudicial. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).

                        A defendant meets the burden for requesting review and disclosure of juvenile records when the defendant joins the people's request for review based on the people's review of the records and belief they contain information that would materially assist
                        the defendant in preparing a defense. People v. Herrera,

                        be given to the plaintiffs only upon a finding by the trial court that public disclosure of the information may be necessary for the resolution of an issue in the case then pending before it. Martin v. County of Weld, 43

                    <p>
                        Trial court need not review department of social services child abuse reports to determine whether confidentiality of reports should be waived when defendant did not meet his initial burden of showing applicability of the exception even though he did
                        allege the reports were crucial to his case. People v. Exline, 775 P.2d 48 (Colo. App. 1988).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that nondisclosed documents were not relevant to any issue before the court. Further, defendant's appellate counsel had no right to review sealed records for purposes of his appeal. Neither appellate
                        defense counsel nor the attorney general's office was allowed access to the records, and allowing appellate defense counsel to review the entire social services file would unnecessarily sacrifice the state's interest in protecting
                        the confidentiality of social services records. People v. Frost, 5 P.3d 317 (Colo. App. 1999).

                        Juvenile court abused its discretion when it chose to review only the last of nine volumes of department of human services' records. First, after the court necessarily determined that defendant had made a sufficient showing to warrant in camera review
                        of those records, it was obligated to review all of the records, despite the fact that such review would have imposed a significant burden on the court. Second, because subsection (2)(f) authorizes only the juvenile court to review
                        the department of human services' records in a case such as this, only the court could determine whether any of the records might be necessary to the determination of an issue before it. People ex rel. A.D.T., 232 P.3d 313 (Colo.

                                The general assembly finds that the intent of this article 2.5 is to protect, restore, and improve the public safety by creating a system of juvenile justice that will appropriately sanction juveniles who violate the law and, in certain cases, will also

                        would hold the juvenile offender accountable for the offense.

                    <p>
                        Design of the Colorado Children's Code. The code was designed to benefit youthful offenders. C.C.C. v. Dist. Court, 188
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 437

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Construction of the Colorado Children's Code. The code should not be construed to diminish the rights of youthful offenders. C.C.C. v. Dist. Court, 188
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 437

                    <p>
                        Procedural safeguards to curb administrative abuse. Procedural safeguards in article 2 were established to curb possible abuse inherent in informal administrative practices in an area involving both the parents' and the child's rights. P.F.M. v. Dist.
                        Court, 184

                    <p>
                        The Colorado Children's Code requires balancing. Because the code is for the benefit and best interests of all Colorado's children, a balancing effect must take place. C.C.C. v. Dist. Court, 188
                        <cite class="co_code">

                        There is a very fundamental difference between a criminal proceeding and a delinquency proceeding, and the clear legislative intent is that the handling of juvenile delinquents should be oriented towards rehabilitation and reformation, and not punishment
                        as such, even though the actions of the child if committed by an adult would justify a criminal proceeding. People ex rel. Terrell v. Dist. Court, 164

                        But juvenile cases must accord due process. There is no constitutional requirement that proceedings in juvenile cases shall be conducted according to the criminal law, or that proceedings need take any particular form, so long as the essentials of due
                        process and fair treatment are accorded. In re People in Interest of J.A.M., 174

                        Delinquency proceeding and child in need of supervision proceeding compared. In delinquency proceedings, the child stands charged with activity which would constitute a crime if done by an adult. In contrast, a child in need of supervision proceeding
                        determines whether the child is a truant, a runaway, or a danger to himself or others. People in Interest of Y.D.M., 197

                        Motion for change of venue untimely in delinquency hearing where merits already adjudicated. A change of venue is properly a pretrial motion to have the merits of the action adjudicated in the correct forum and county. Accordingly, such a motion is untimely
                        in a juvenile delinquency hearing if the merits have already been adjudicated in their entirety, which occurs with the determination that the allegations in the original petition are true and the finding that the child is a juvenile

                        The purpose of former subsection (3)(c)(I) (now subsection (1)) is to provide a child with parental guidance during police interrogation and to ensure that any waiver of the child's fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and sixth amendment
                        right to counsel will be made knowingly and intelligently. People in Interest of G.L., 631 P.2d 1118 (Colo. 1981).

                        Legislative purpose of subsection (1), barring admission of statements made during police interrogation of minor unless minor's parents, guardian, legal custodian, or attorney are present, is to provide minor with an opportunity to consult with such person

                        Subsection (1) does not condition the admissibility of a juvenile's statements to law enforcement on more than his or her parent's presence during a Miranda advisement and interrogation. The plain language of subsection (1) requires only that a parent
                        be present during the advisement and interrogation. It is unnecessary for a trial court to examine a parent's motivation. People in the Interest of A.L.-C., 2016 CO 71, 382 P.3d 842.

                        Factual findings as to "custody" and "interrogation" are necessary predicates to any application of this section. Where magistrate failed to make findings on question of whether juvenile was in custody and being interrogated, matter was remanded to the
                        district court for development of further evidence. People in Interest of R.A., 937 P.2d 731 (Colo. 1997).

                        Protection afforded statements and admissions of child applies to searches. The same test is applicable to the validity of the search whether the consenting party is an adult or a juvenile with the one exception noted in former subsection (3) (now subsection
                        (1)) of this section. That is, a parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the child must be present and freely and intelligently give his consent. Although this subsection (3) refers specifically to "statements and admissions",
                        and requires that the interrogating officer afford both the juvenile and his parent, guardian, or legal custodian full fifth amendment protection, the juvenile is entitled to comparable protection in connection with the waiver
                        of his fourth amendment rights. People v. Reyes, 174

                        Defendant's consent to search was voluntary and not the result of coercion. Defendant's parents provided guidance and advice before, during, and after the interrogation. The parents' position that they approved of DNA testing was consistent throughout.

                        The language, "acts which if committed by an adult", which appears almost verbatim in former subsection (3)(c)(I) (now subsection (1)), was intended to define, by analogy, a general type of conduct for which a child might be taken into custody and for

                        The warnings incorporated in a Miranda advisement have been codified in the juvenile context by this section, together with the requirement that the juvenile be accompanied by a parent, guardian, or custodian during the advisement and interrogation. People

                        In determining whether a juvenile is in custody for purposes of this section, a court must consider whether a reasonable person in the juvenile's position would consider himself or herself significantly deprived of his or her liberty. In deciding whether
                        a reasonable person would believe himself or herself to be deprived of his or her freedom of action, the court must consider the totality of circumstances. The factors the court should consider are: The time, place, and purpose
                        of the encounter; the persons present during the interrogation; the words spoken by the officer to the defendant; the officer's tone of voice and general demeanor; the length and mood of the interrogation; whether any limitation
                        of movement or other form of restraint was placed on the defendant during the interrogation; the officer's response to any questions asked by the defendant; whether directions were given to the defendant during the interrogation;

                        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress statements made during a phone conversation with a victim who was a minor. First, the standards for determining whether a party's consent is voluntary for purposes of the eavesdropping
                        and wiretapping statutes are less stringent than the standards applicable to questions of voluntariness arising in the context of alleged violations of constitutional rights. Second, the victim was not in custody when he agreed
                        to the recording of the conversation but rather his consent was given in an effort to assist in the apprehension and prosecution of defendant. People v. Richardson,

                        to terminate the questioning at any time. People in Interest of M.R.J., 633 P.2d 474 (Colo. 1981).

                        Factors in determining voluntariness of confession. In determining whether a juvenile's confession is voluntary, the primary factors to be considered are the juvenile's age, experience, background, and intelligence, his capacity to understand the warnings
                        given him, the nature of his fifth amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights. People in Interest of M.R.J., 633 P.2d 474 (Colo. 1981).

                        And prosecution to prove voluntariness by preponderance. Once the issue of voluntariness has been raised, the prosecution has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the statements were made voluntarily. People in Interest of

                        Confession obtained during custodial interrogation properly determined voluntary despite fact that waiver of parental attendance was not in writing. The juvenile and his parents waived their right to consult with an attorney and orally waived their right
                        to parental attendance at the interrogation, and the interviewing detective's "soft technique", if any, did not constitute improper coercion. People v. Grant, 30 P.3d 667 (Colo. App. 2000), aff'd, 48 P.3d 543 (Colo. 2002).

                        The remedy for a violation of this section is suppression of the statements obtained. However, that remedy applies only to statements made as a result of custodial interrogation. People v. T.C., 898 P.2d 20 (Colo. 1995).

                        Section is applicable even when a juvenile lies to police about his age. Nicholas v. People, 973 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1999).

                        General assembly did not provide for an exception for juveniles who lie about their age to the police and claim to be adults. Nor is there a "good faith" exception for cases in which the police reasonably but mistakenly believe that their suspect is an
                        adult. Nicholas v. People, 973 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1999).

                    <p>
                        This interpretation is consistent with the way civil law protects juveniles from being bound by legal decisions they make even if they lie about their age. Nicholas v. People, 973 P.2d 1213 (Colo. 1999).

                        Minor's statements suppressed when gained through police urgings following his expressed desire to stop interrogation. Where a minor defendant responded to one of the officer's questions by stating, "I ain't going to say nothing no more", but the officers
                        continued to urge defendant to tell the truth, a statement gained by those urgings was suppressed. People v. Saiz, 42

                    <p>
                        Where the police were actively involved in the continued urging of minor defendant "to tell the truth", the fact that the defendant's parents made similar requests did not absolve the police of any wrongdoing, or allow them to disregard defendant's exercise
                        of his right to cut off questioning. People v. Saiz, 42

                        Tainted fruit doctrine does not require the automatic suppression of later statements made by the defendant or by witnesses whose identity was derived from the defendant's initial, unwarned statement. Although the lack of a Miranda warning creates a presumption
                        of compulsion, the presumption can be rebutted and the initial statement shown to be voluntary in light of the totality of the circumstances. People v. T.C., 898 P.2d 20 (Colo. 1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, fruits doctrine does not require suppression of properly obtained second confession where, although first confession was suppressed for lack of the written parental attendance waiver required under subsection (5), first confession nevertheless was
                        voluntary. People v. Grant, 30 P.3d 667 (Colo. App. 2000), aff'd on other grounds, 48 P.3d 543 (Colo. 2002).

                        It is implicit that a child involved in the commission of an offense should be afforded protective counseling concerning his legal rights from one whose interests are not adverse to those of the child, to the end that any statements made by the child
                        be given voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. People v. McAnally, 192

                        Purpose of parental presence at interrogation. The statutory requirement of the presence of a parent or guardian at the interrogation of a child by law enforcement officers is designed to provide parental guidance and assistance to the child and thereby
                        to provide at least some minimal assurance that a child's waiver of his right against self-incrimination is knowingly and intelligently made. People in Interest of L.B., 33

                        Subsection (5) requires police to advise a juvenile of the right to have a parent present during custodial interrogation and acquire an express waiver of that right from the juvenile prior to conducting an interrogation of the juvenile without the presence
                        of a parent. People v. Barrow, 139 P.3d 636 (Colo. 2006).

                    <p>
                        The "full advisement" requirement of subsection (5) is not satisfied by merely showing the minor defendant a form signed by his parent indicating that she granted permission for the interview to proceed outside her presence. People v. Barrow, 139 P.3d

                        Subsection (5) requires that a waiver of the right to parental attendance must be express, in writing, and obtained after a Miranda advisement; however, it does not require that the writing be signed. People v. Grant, 30 P.3d 667 (Colo. App. 2000), aff'd,

                        Although subsection (5) does not require a signature on the written waiver of parental attendance, the written waiver must in some manner be attributable to the person against whom it is to be enforced. A signature on the document obviously is the most
                        direct means to demonstrate this, but it is not the only way for one to acknowledge or ratify the document. People v. Grant, 30 P.3d 667 (Colo. App. 2000), aff'd, 48 P.3d 543 (Colo. 2002).

                        Detective complied with this section by informing both the juvenile and his guardian verbally that the juvenile had the right to have his guardian present during police questioning. The signed waiver form also indicated the right to have the guardian
                        present. People v. Barrios, 2019 CO 10, 433 P.3d 1218.

                        Even though the detective minimized the potential offenses and there was a lack of actual consultation between the juvenile and his guardian, the juvenile legally waived his right to have his guardian present during the interrogation. Under the totality
                        of the circumstances, those concerns did not undermine the reliability of the waiver. People v. Barrios, 2019 CO 10, 433 P.3d 1218.

                        Where parent is himself incarcerated, his ability to guide and advise the child is hobbled and restrained by his own circumstances to such an extent that his mere physical presence does not satisfy the requirements of this section concerning confessions

                        Out-of-state runaways are not afforded the protections of this section. Statements from a juvenile who is a runaway from another state are admissible if the juvenile is of sufficient age and understanding. Sufficient age and understanding refers to the

                        Trial court properly found that juvenile was emancipated, therefore absence of the juvenile's parent at custodial interrogation did not require the court to suppress the juvenile's statement. The trial court appropriately found that the juvenile was emancipated
                        where the juvenile had been on his own for three months and had not been receiving financial support from his mother. People v. Lucas, 992 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1999).

                        Trial court properly held that juvenile was emancipated even though legal and physical custody of the juvenile had been placed with the department of human services. The language of this section implicitly recognizes that a juvenile may be emancipated
                        from the custody of someone other than the parent, including the state. People v. Lucas, 992 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1999).

                        Application of former subsection (3)(c)(I) (now subsection (1)). Read in context, the limitations of former subsection (3)(c)(I) (now subsection (1)) apply only when a child is in temporary custody or under detention, as those terms are used in the Colorado

                        Under Miranda and former subsection (3)(c)(I) (now subsection (1)), the decisive stage for the warnings is custodial interrogation, i.e., questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived
                        of his freedom of action in any significant way. People v. Lee, 630 P.2d 583 (Colo. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1162, 102 S. Ct. 1036, 71 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1982).

                        Physical custodians under subsection (1) must be limited to the adult or adults with whom the child resided immediately prior to the arrest and custodial interrogation. If an adult is functioning as a current physical custodian for the child at the time
                        of the interrogation, a protective relationship sufficient to satisfy the legislative purposes presumptively exists. People v. Legler, 969 P.2d 691 (Colo. 1998).

                        Principal and security officer did not act as agents of the police. Whether or not an individual conducting a search is an agent of the police and thus "a law enforcement official" under subsection (1) is determined by the totality of the circumstances.
                        The fact that the police officer supplied information to the school principal with the intent of initiating a search and that he was present on school premises during the investigation do not support a finding that the principal
                        and security officer acted as agent of "a law enforcement official". People in Interest of P.E.A., 754 P.2d 382 (Colo. 1988); People in Interest of F.M., 754 P.2d 390 (Colo. 1988).

                    The general assembly declares that the placement of children and juveniles in a detention facility exacts a negative impact on the mental and physical well-being of the child or juvenile, and such detention may make it more likely that the child or juvenile
                    will reoffend. Children and juveniles who are detained are more likely to penetrate deeper into the juvenile justice system than similar children or juveniles who are not detained, and community-based alternatives to detention should
                    be based on the principle of using the least-restrictive setting possible and returning a child or juvenile to his or her home, family, or other responsible adult whenever possible consistent with public safety. It is the intent of

                                        The only purposes of a detention hearing are to determine if a juvenile should be detained further and to define conditions under which the juvenile may be released, if release is appropriate. A detention hearing must not be combined with a preliminary

                        This section does not violate constitutional guarantees of due process to juveniles. Juveniles do not have an absolute constitutional right to bail and the presumption statute does not impermissibly shift the burden of proof from the state to the juvenile
                        with respect to establishing whether secure detention is warranted. Instead, the statute merely requires the juvenile to introduce some evidence to overcome the presumption of dangerousness created by the statute. People v. Juvenile
                        Court, 893 P.2d 81 (Colo. 1995).

                        Detention hearing required whether placement is in shelter or detention facility. The term "detention hearing", in the context of subsection (2), refers to a situation where a child is placed in a shelter facility as well as a situation where a child
                        is placed in a detention facility. In both situations the child is removed from the custody of the parents, and both the statute and due process require a prompt hearing to determine whether the welfare of the child or of the community
                        require that the "detention" continue. P.F.M. v. Dist. Court, 184

                        Hearing requirement is not jurisdictional. It would be contrary to the purposes of the Colorado Children's Code and possibly to the best interests of the children involved to hold that the hearing requirement of subsection (2) is jurisdictional. P.F.M.

                        The evidence presented by a juvenile to overcome the presumption of dangerousness created by this section need not implicate constitutional protections against self-incrimination. Evidence that one does not constitute a danger to himself or others need

                        Detention of juveniles possessing deadly weapons prior to the conclusion of formal adjudicatory proceedings serves a legitimate state objective in view of the relationship between possession of a deadly weapon by a juvenile and the risk of imminent and
                        serious harm to the community or the juvenile. Trial court's findings that confinement of juveniles in certain secure detention facilities constituted punishment did not resolve the issue of the facial validity of the statute creating
                        a presumption of dangerousness. A court must consider the legislative purposes giving rise to the statute, the relationship between the statutory provisions and the purposes, and the procedures authorized by the statute. People

                        Juvenile courts cannot delegate power to detain to executive branch. The Colorado Children's Code gives the juvenile courts the power to detain 14- and 15-year-old children in an adult detention facility, but the court cannot delegate its judicial power

                        seventy-two hours after the detention hearing, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. Upon filing the petition, the court, if practicable, shall send notice of the pendency of such action to the juvenile's parent, guardian,
                        or legal custodian.

                        If the petition is the first juvenile petition filed against the juvenile in any jurisdiction and is initiated in a jurisdiction that has restorative justice practices available, the district attorney or the district attorney's designee may determine
                        whether the juvenile is suitable for restorative justice practices. The district attorney shall consider whether the victim, having been informed about restorative justice practices pursuant to section 24-4.1-303 (11)(g), is requesting
                        consideration of restorative justice practices as an alternative to formal prosecution; the seriousness of the crime; the crime's impact on the victim; the best methodology to involve the victim; whether the juvenile accepts responsibility
                        for, expresses remorse for, and is willing to repair the harm caused by the juvenile's actions; whether the juvenile's parent or legal guardian is willing to support the juvenile in the process; and other programmatic support available.
                        If a juvenile wants to participate in restorative justice practices, the juvenile shall make the request to the district attorney or the law enforcement agency administering the program and may not make the request to the victim.
                        If requested by the juvenile, restorative justice practices may only be conducted after the district attorney consults with the victim and offers the victim an opportunity to participate or submit a victim impact statement. If
                        a victim elects not to attend, a victim-offender conference may be held with a suitable victim surrogate or victim advocate, and the victim may submit a victim impact statement. The district attorney may offer dismissal of charges
                        as an option for the successful completion of these and any other conditions imposed and designed to address the harm done to the victim and the community by the offender, subject to approval by the court.

                    <p>
                        Juvenile proceedings are governed by the procedural rules contained in the Colorado Children's Code. People ex rel. M.C.L., 671 P.2d 1339 (Colo. App. 1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hearing may be informally conducted, and the court may take into consideration all factors which he normally takes into account when sentencing. People in Interest of B.L.M. v. B.L.M., 31

        Colo. App. 106, 500 P.2d 146

                    <p>
                        And court is not bound by strict rules of evidence in a hearing to determine whether probation should be revoked. People in Interest of B.L.M. v. B.L.M., 31

                    <p>
                        Thus, there is a presumption that all incompetent or hearsay evidence is disregarded by a court in reaching its conclusions, so a judgment will not be reversed on appeal because of the admission of such evidence. People in Interest of B.L.M. v. B.L.M.,

                    <p>
                        However, the Colorado Children's Code does not dispense with rules of evidence which directly bear upon substantive proof although the code does permit hearings to be conducted in an informal manner. Daugaard v. People in Interest of Daugaard, 176

                    <p>
                        Lack of transcript and evidence required reversal. Where an order was entered declaring a child neglected and dependent, severing parental rights, and holding the child's grandfather in contempt of court for failure to deliver the child, but the court
                        reporter certified that there had been no transcript made of any of the hearings prior to the one on the contempt violation, and since there was no evidence or showing that the home environment which the grandfather might provide
                        for the child would be unsatisfactory the judgment and orders of the trial court were reversed. C.B. v. People in Interest of J.T.B., 30

                        Trial court did not err in denying the request for a jury trial. Since defendant's charge of sexual assault on a child did not include charges of bodily injury, intimidation, threats, or force, defendant was not charged with a crime of violence as defined

                        incompetent to proceed or orders the juvenile referred for a competency examination, the court may declare a mistrial. If the court declares a mistrial under these circumstances, the juvenile must not be deemed to have been placed

                        the juvenile will never be tried, therefore, the juvenile's right to presumption of innocence is not contemplated. People ex rel. C.Y.,

                        Defendant's 84-year sentence for nonhomicide crimes committed as a juvenile is not an unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment under Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010). Defendant will be eligible for parole when he is 57 years old and thus has
                        a meaningful opportunity for release during his natural lifetime. People v. Lucero,

                        Graham's holding is limited to offenders convicted of non-homicide offenses. The Graham court used the term "homicide" to refer to crimes causing the victim's death. Rainer v. Hansen, 952 F.3d 1203 (10th Cir. 2020).

                        Graham therefore applies in a case involving first-degree attempted murder because attempted first-degree murder is not a homicide offense in this state. Rainer v. Hansen, 952 F.3d 1203 (10th Cir. 2020).

                        Probation is not an option for a juvenile convicted of a crime of violence in adult court as a result of either a transfer or direct file, therefore, there is no equal protection violation. This section states that a juvenile convicted of a crime of violence
                        is not subject to the mandatory minimum provisions in §
                        <cite class="occo">

         19-2-518
        </a>
       </cite> , does not contain similar language. That difference is immaterial to the issue of whether probation is a possible sentence. This section does not permit a probation sentence for a direct file juvenile, it only excludes
                        the juvenile from the mandatory minimum sentence that begins at least at the midpoint of the presumptive range. A court can sentence the juvenile below the midpoint of the presumptive range but still has to sentence the juvenile
                        to incarceration. In a transfer case, the court must sentence the juvenile to incarceration starting at the midpoint of the presumptive range. So, a juvenile convicted of a crime of violence in adult court either as a result of
                        a transfer or direct file must be sentenced to incarceration and thus is not eligible for probation, therefore, there is no equal protection violation. Howard v. People, 2020 CO 15, 458 P.3d 893.

                        Subsection (3)(b)(VI) does not constitute a waiver of a juvenile defendant's psychotherapist-patient privilege. Because the proper inquiry to determine whether there was a waiver of privilege is whether a party injected his or her physical or mental health
                        condition into the case, simply requesting a reverse-transfer hearing does not waive the privilege. Subsection (3)(b)(VI) only requires that the trial court consider mental health records "made available", that is, voluntarily
                        waived by the privilege holder. People v. Johnson, 2016 CO 69, 381 P.3d 316.

                        court take into account "relevant mental health or psychological assessments or screenings that are made available to both the district attorney and defense counsel". A juvenile has a significant interest in the confidentiality
                        of both past and future mental health records. People v. Johnson, 2016 CO 69, 381 P.3d 316.

                        To transfer jurisdiction from juvenile court to district court, the trial court must determine the following:

                            Whether there is "probable cause" to believe that the juvenile committed the offense for which the prosecution seeks a waiver of jurisdiction; and (2) whether it would be contrary to the best interests of the juvenile or the public to retain jurisdiction

                    <p>
                        (1) The seriousness of the offense and whether the protection of the community requires isolation of the juvenile beyond that afforded by juvenile facilities; (2) whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful
                        manner; (3) whether the alleged offense was against persons or property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons; (4) the maturity of the juvenile as determined by considerations of the juvenile's home, environment,
                        emotional attitude, and pattern of living; (5) the record and previous history of the juvenile; (6) the likelihood of rehabilitation of the juvenile by use of facilities available to the juvenile court; (7) the interest of the
                        community in the imposition of a punishment commensurate with the gravity of the offense; and (8) the impact of the offense on the victim. People v. Lee, 989 P.2d 777 (Colo. App. 1999).

                        Transfer to district court was appropriate, even though alleged offenses were against property rather than a person, where the court found the following factors:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (1) The offenses were committed in a premeditated and willful manner; (2) defendant was more mature than his chronological age; (3) the interest of the community in the imposition of punishment commensurate with the offenses supported transfer because
                        the school building that was the object of the arson was important to the community; and (4) in light of the historic nature of the building and the risk to the lives of the firefighters who extinguished the blaze, the impact of
                        the offense on the victim was quite serious. People v. Rivera, 968 P.2d 1061 (Colo. App. 1997).

                        Court considers interest of child or public. At the hearing provided for in this section the juvenile court may consider only whether it would be contrary to the best interests of the child or of the public to retain jurisdiction over the child. If the
                        court finds that a child should be held for criminal proceedings in the district court, it shall enter an order certifying that fact and transfer the case to the district court. Maddox v. People, 178

                        The test under subsection (3)(b) is whether the interests of the juvenile or the community would be better served by the juvenile court's waiving its jurisdiction. People v. Rivera, 968 P.2d 1061 (Colo. App. 1997).

                        Appearance waives personal service. The voluntary appearance of juvenile's mother and her participation in the transfer hearing constitutes a waiver of her right to personal service. People v. District Court, 183

                        a transfer hearing. People v. Pino, 262 P.3d 938 (Colo. App. 2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the conducting of a transfer hearing is the only event that vests the juvenile court with exclusive jurisdiction and the juvenile court had not conducted a transfer hearing before the prosecution directly filed the information, the district court
                        had jurisdiction. People v. Pino, 262 P.3d 938 (Colo. App. 2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever a juvenile court elects to waive jurisdiction over a child and certifies child to the criminal jurisdiction of a district court, the district court retains jurisdiction over the child, and it may properly impose sentence for any resulting felony
                        convictions. Although this section grants the district court the power to dispose of the case as would a juvenile court, or to remand the case to the juvenile court for disposition, the decision to do so is within the discretion
                        of the district court. People v. Hernandez, 690 P.2d 263 (Colo. App. 1984).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in transferring jurisdiction of a case from juvenile court to district court despite defendant's arguments that he was not 16 years old at the time of alleged offense, that he had been previously adjudicated a
                        delinquent on only one occasion, and that he had not been previously committed to department of institutions or been adjudicated for any crime of violence. The court properly relied on the fact that defendant had been in juvenile
                        system for offenses involving sexual aggression, that he appeared to pose a threat to children, that he was on probation at the time of present offense, and that alleged offense was a serious one. People v. Armand, 873 P.2d 7 (Colo.

                        Abuse of juvenile court's discretion. Juvenile court abused its discretion during the transfer hearing by finding sua sponte that there was probable cause to support the lesser-included offense of attempt to commit manslaughter rather than attempt to

                        Evidence held sufficient. In a proceeding to declare children delinquent, evidence held legally sufficient to warrant a finding that the children were delinquent. Kahm v. People, 83

                        Evidence held insufficient. Evidence held clearly insufficient to support court's finding that minor was a "delinquent child". Carmean v. People, 110

                        Where a minor child aged 16 was alleged to be a delinquent, grounded on the allegation that he had committed an assault and battery, but at the close of the evidence presented by the people, the court ruled that the evidence presented was not sufficient
                        to sustain the allegations of the petition and entered a judgment of acquittal, on appeal by the people it was held that the case was moot. The minor had been acquitted of the charge contained in the petition and could not again
                        be put in jeopardy for this offense. People in Interest of G.D.K. v. G.D.K., 30

                        A minute order can be effective as a written order or judgment when the parties to an action attend a hearing concerning the subject matter of the order and understand the substantive content of the decision represented by the minute order. Wesson v.

                        The written minute order waiving juvenile court jurisdiction triggered the requirement for the prosecution to file an information in district court within five days of the issuance of the order and, since the time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional,
                        the prosecution's failure to file an information within that time limit rendered the waiver null and void and the juvenile court was required to retain jurisdiction. People v. Easter, 914 P.2d 493 (Colo. App. 1995).

                        The later issuance of a second written order by the juvenile court judge cannot correct the prosecution's failure initially to file the information and is not permitted under the mandatory language of subsection (6)(a). People v. Easter, 914 P.2d 493

                        Trial court's failure to sentence juvenile within 45 days after adjudication pursuant to subsection (3)(a) entitles juvenile to credit for pre-sentence confinement for the period following the expiration of the 45-day sentencing deadline until the date
                        of sentencing. The trial court retains discretion as to whether to grant pre-sentence confinement credit for any confinement from the date of adjudication until the expiration of the 45-day sentencing deadline. People ex rel. J.R.,

                        Acts not grounds for delinquency do not support commitment to institution for delinquents. It would be contrary to the obvious legislative intent to allow a child to be committed to an institution for juvenile delinquents where the only acts alleged,
                        violation of child in need of supervision probation, were those which were not, in and of themselves, grounds for an adjudication of delinquency and for which the statute already provides a comprehensive and complete procedure

                        The custodial placement sentencing option of former subsection (1)(d) is not available for violent juvenile offenders because the plain language of former subsection (2) specifically states that the judge shall sentence any juvenile adjudicated as a special

                        The federal Controlled Substances Act does not preempt the state's restitution statutes. There is no positive conflict between the two statutes. The restitution statutes do not require a defendant to violate the Controlled Substances Act. Ordering restitution
                        to a licensed marijuana business and thereby acknowledging a state property interest in marijuana does not positively conflict with the Controlled Substances Act. People in Interest of D.M.,

                        Section meets requirements of due process. Because subsection (4) requires notice and a hearing in cases of alleged violation of juvenile probation and because the prosecution must establish the alleged criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the
                        statutory scheme by which probation revocation triggers mandatory sentence offender status does not deny due process. People in Interest of D.G., 733 P.2d 1199 (Colo. 1987).

                        Due process requirements met even though findings of fact were inadequate because general record supports revocation of probation. Even though trial court's findings of fact concerning ability of child to pay restitution were inadequate to revoke probation
                        on that ground, record supports revocation of child's probation on other grounds and is consistent with due process requirements of fundamental fairness and appellate court will not set aside revocation where court's general finding
                        is adequate. People in Interest of C.J.W., 727 P.2d 870 (Colo. App. 1986).

                        Section provides notice and hearing before revocation. In the event that a child violates the terms and conditions of a child in need of supervision probation, this section provides for notice to the child, his parents, guardian, or other legal custodian,

                        Revocation justified upon commission of criminal acts. Where a court finds that a child on probation has committed acts which if committed by an adult would be crimes, these findings are sufficient to justify revocation of probation, and the fact that
                        they were filed subsequent to the order recommitting the child and directing issuance of the mittimus is not prejudicial. People in Interest of B.L.M. v. B.L.M., 31

                        Acts not grounds for delinquency do not support commitment to institution for delinquents. It would be contrary to the obvious legislative intent to allow a child to be committed to an institution for juvenile delinquents where the only acts alleged,
                        violation of child in need of supervision probation, were those which were not, in and of themselves, grounds for an adjudication of delinquency and for which the statute already provides a comprehensive and complete procedure

                        Previous adjudication need not be based on felony. The unambiguous language of former subsection (2)(b) requires two prior acts by a child each of which would have constituted a crime if committed by an adult; there is no merit in the contention that
                        the subsection must be read to include the definition of a repeat juvenile offender (former §

                        A juvenile does not qualify as a mandatory sentence offender or a repeat juvenile offender when the multiple adjudications required by those provisions occur in the same hearing. A guilty plea that the court accepts plainly constitutes an adjudication
                        under the statute; however, to be a mandatory sentence offender, a juvenile must, after having "been adjudicated a juvenile delinquent twice", be "subsequently adjudicated a juvenile delinquent". To be a repeat juvenile offender,
                        he or she must have "been previously adjudicated a juvenile delinquent"."Subsequently" and "previously" entail the passage of enough time for the juvenile to experience the consequences of his or her earlier adjudications. People

                        Former subsection (5)(a)(I)(A) (now subsection (1)(a)(I)(A)) gives a court discretion in sentencing an aggravated juvenile offender and does not require a commitment sentence to the department of human services. The court's decision to suspend the commitment
                        sentence on condition of successfully completing probation for an offense that did not constitute a class 1 or 2 felony if committed by an adult was permitted by the sentencing law. A.S. v. People, 2013 CO 63, 312 P.3d 168.

                        Section does not address appropriate sentencing options for an aggravated juvenile offender who, at 22 years of age, is already an adult at the time of sentencing for acts committed as a juvenile. Since aggravated juvenile offenders must be sentenced
                        pursuant to this section, there is a gap in the statute that must be filled by the legislature. Therefore, courts sentencing aggravated juvenile offenders who have aged out of the department of human services at the time of sentencing
                        may apply the provisions of former subsection (8) (now subsection (4)) that do not require participation by the department of human services and consider all available sentencing options listed under former subsection (8) (now
                        subsection (4)). People in Interest of E.G.,

                    The division of youth services is authorized to establish a pilot program, when funds become available, in its facilities to facilitate victim-initiated victim-offender conferences whereby a victim of a crime may request a facilitated conference with
                    the juvenile who committed the crime, if the juvenile is in the custody of the division of youth services. After such a pilot program is established, the division of youth services may establish policies and procedures for the victim-offender
                    conferences using volunteers to facilitate the conferences. The volunteers shall complete the division of youth services' volunteer and facility-specific training programs and complete high-risk victim-offender training and victim-advocacy
                    training. The division of youth services shall not compensate or reimburse a volunteer or victim for any expenses. If a pilot program is available, and subsequent to the victim's or the victim representative's request, the division
                    of youth services shall arrange a conference only after determining that the conference would be safe and only if the juvenile agrees to participate. The purposes of the conference are to enable the victim to meet the juvenile, to
                    obtain answers to questions only the juvenile can answer, to assist the victim in healing from the impact of the crime, and to promote a sense of remorse and acceptance of responsibility by the juvenile that may contribute to the juvenile's
                    rehabilitation.

                        The general assembly intended to segregate children found to be in need of supervision from delinquents by providing that the former may not be initially placed in institutions for juvenile delinquents nor may they be transferred by the director of institutions
                        to such institutions without approval of court. The general assembly also set up separate sections of the statute to separate the disposition and punishment of those adjudicated as children in need of supervision from those adjudicated
                        as delinquent. People in Interest of D.R., 29

                        making such efforts, the health and safety of the child is the paramount concern. This federal law further encourages expediting permanency planning for children in out-of-home placement by removing barriers to permanency and streamlining
                        entitlement services. The law specifies that one of the goals of all placement decisions, whether leaving the child in the home or placing the child outside the home, is safety for the child.

                        occurs for children in foster care, and that safe child placements occur in each case.

                                        The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that emotional and cognitive disruptions in the early lives of children have the potential to impair brain development. Paramount in the lives of children in foster care is their need for continuity with their
                                        primary attachment figures and a sense of permanence that is enhanced when the child's placement is stable.

                                        The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that attachment to a primary caregiver is essential to the development of emotional security and social conscience; and

                                        According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, optimal child development occurs when a spectrum of needs is consistently met over an extended period. Separation of a child from his or her primary caregiver occurring between six months and three years
                                        of age is more likely to result in subsequent emotional disturbances for the child than if the separation occurs when the child is older. Repeated moves from home to home compound the adverse consequences of separation.
                                        Further, the younger the child and the more extended the period of uncertainty or separation, the more detrimental the separation will be to the child's well-being. Any intervention that separates a child from the
                                        child's primary caregiver or person who provides psychological support to the child should be cautiously considered and treated as a matter of urgency and profound importance.

                                The general assembly further finds that older children in foster care are at a high risk of having long-term mental health issues, dropping out of school, developing alcohol and drug dependence, experiencing promiscuity, and interacting with the criminal
                                justice system. Multiple moves for older children lead to disruption in schooling and meaningful relationships and attachments, including relationships with peers and family of origin. As a result these children have few,
                                if any, long-term connections when they leave foster care, resulting in little support for their growth into independent adults.

                                The general assembly therefore declares that multiple moves for children in the dependency and neglect system should be discouraged in favor of permanent planning upon which these children can rely for their healthy mental, physical, and emotional development.

                        the services and processes that must be in place to ensure that "reasonable efforts" have been made. The general assembly provides that "reasonable efforts" are deemed to be met when a county or city and county provides services
                        in accordance with section 19-3-208 and when full consideration has been given to the provisions of section 24-34-805 (2).

        Colorado Children's Code defines a "child" as a person under 18 years of age. When the general assembly amended the definition of child in 1967 and removed the reference to an unborn child, the intent was to change the law and no longer subject an unborn child to the provisions of the Children's Code. Additionally, the remedies that are available in dependency and neglect actions support the conclusion that an unborn child is not subject to the Children's Code. The provisions and remedies in the dependency and neglect statutes all relate to a child who has been born. People ex rel. H., 74 P.3d 494

                        disability. In order to make a determination as to whether the child is in a life-threatening situation or that the child's condition will result in serious disability, the court may, as provided under section 19-1-104 (3), order
                        a medical evaluation of the child. If the court determines, on the basis of any relevant evidence before the court, including the medical evaluation ordered pursuant to this section, that the child is in a life-threatening situation

                        of a guardian ad litem -- as a request for the appointment of trial counsel or, at the very least, asked if father wanted counsel. In re R.L.S.,

                        The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to consider any factors other than whether a respondent was automatically eligible under the guidelines and made no findings of fact regarding the point at which the respondent's indigency status and
                        eligibility changed. Waters v. Dist. Ct., 935 P.2d 981 (Colo. 1997).

                        The court is required to consider the respondent's complete financial circumstances by allowing him an opportunity to establish that he lacks the necessary funds, on a practical basis, to retain competent counsel. Waters v. Dist. Ct., 935 P.2d 981 (Colo.

                        The trial court abused its discretion by redetermining respondent's eligibility for court appointed counsel and finding him retroactively ineligible. The court could not change respondent's status without allowing him an opportunity to produce evidence
                        of his total financial circumstances including his practical ability to retain competent counsel. Waters v. Dist. Ct., 935 P.2d 981 (Colo. 1997).

                        In determining whether to authorize payment of a fee in excess of established maximum total fee, a judge should consider whether special circumstances required additional time be spent on the case, including but not limited to a consideration of whether
                        the case required extensive legal research or factual investigation. Waters v. Dist. Ct., 935 P.2d 981 (Colo. 1997).

                        Until the client is found to be ineligible, a court-appointed attorney will be paid by the state and that the client will be required to reimburse the state if he subsequently is found to be ineligible for court-appointed counsel. Waters v. Dist. Ct.,

                        In general, a court-appointed attorney is to be awarded fees and costs at state expense for services rendered from the date of appointment to the date that the court enters an order finding the defendant to be ineligible. Waters v. Dist. Ct., 935 P.2d

                        However, the trial court retains discretion to determine that the state will pay attorney fees and costs only up to the time at which the client's indigency status changed if the court makes specific findings of fact regarding circumstances that justify
                        such a disposition such as fraud or misrepresentation on the part of appointed counsel. Waters v. Dist. Ct., 935 P.2d 981 (Colo. 1997).

                        If the trial court determines that a person became ineligible at a previous date, the court shall order that the person reimburse the state in whole or in part for the expenses and costs it incurred on that person's behalf. Waters v. Dist. Ct., 935 P.2d

                    <p>
                        The state is the exclusive party to file a petition in dependency and neglect and a guardian ad litem has no authority to assume the role of the state. People in Interest of R.E., 729 P.2d 1032 (Colo. App. 1986).

                    <p>
                        If there is such an objection, the trial court must conduct a hearing and specifically determine whether the petition is supported by a preponderance of the evidence and the child is in fact dependent and neglected. That determination may be appealed

                    <p>
                        Determination of whether a guardian ad litem may be examined and cross-examined depends on the manner in which the guardian chooses to proceed in fulfilling the statutory requirements of the position. If a guardian presents a recommendation based on an
                        independent investigation, the facts of which have not otherwise been introduced into evidence, the guardian functions as a witness in the proceedings and, thus, should be subject to examination and cross-examination as to the
                        bases for the opinion and recommendation. If the guardian's recommendations are based upon the evidence received by the court from other sources, then they are analogous to arguments made by counsel and examination and cross-examination
                        should not be permitted. Therefore, the trial court did not err in limiting a mother's examination of her children's guardian ad litem during the hearing on terminating the parent-child legal relationship where the record demonstrated
                        that the guardian had chosen to examine the witnesses called by others and to present his recommendations in the form of legal argument based upon the facts and opinions testified to by others. People in Interest of J.E.B., 854

                        Age is a jurisdictional prerequisite both at the filing of a petition and at the time of adjudication. In a case where the child was just shy of 18 at the time the dependency and neglect petition was filed but turned 18 before the hearing, the juvenile

                        A violation of state law duty, by itself, is insufficient to give rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs could not maintain a substantive due process claim based on defendants' alleged violations of their duties under the Child Protection
                        Act to report and investigate allegations of child abuse. Pierce v. Delta County Dept. of Soc. Servs., 119 F. Supp. 2d 1139 (D.

                        Defendants' alleged failure to report and investigate child abuse allegations does not deprive plaintiffs of a protected liberty interest without due process of law. While plaintiffs may have had an expectation that some form of protective services would
                        be taken if defendants complied with the statutory requirements, the expectation of action is not enough to create a protected liberty interest under the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. Pierce v. Delta County Dept.

                        The mandatory reporting duty on public school teachers is not limited to the reporting of any known or suspected child abuse or neglect learned of during the course of their professional capacity. Rather, the reporting duty applies irrespective of the

                        Information about defendant's background and demeanor during visit to mental health facility fell within scope of child abuse reporting statute. The information reported verbally by counselor in phone call to police and in subsequent written form was
                        relevant to counselor's ability to determine whether defendant's "visions" had any basis in reality and as such constituted a legitimate report of suspected child abuse and was therefore exempt from confidentiality requirements

                        Similarly, child's statements to public school employees and to caseworker are not testimonial simply because of their statutory duty to report. The employees and caseworker were not law enforcement officials; law enforcement officials had not asked them
                        to question child about his injuries; and they did not otherwise work with law enforcement officials to obtain child's injury-related statements for later use in prosecuting defendant. People v. Phillips,

                        A violation of state law duty, by itself, is insufficient to give rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs could not maintain a substantive due process claim based on defendants' alleged violations of their duties under the Child Protection

                        Defendants' alleged failure to report and investigate child abuse allegations does not deprive plaintiffs of a protected liberty interest without due process of law. While plaintiffs may have had an expectation that some form of protective services would
                        be taken if defendants complied with the statutory requirements, the expectation of action is not enough to create a protected liberty interest under the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. Pierce v. Delta County Dept.

                        the general assembly hereby finds and declares that it is in the best interests of the children and the citizens of the state of Colorado for the state department to modify the processing of records and reports of child abuse or

                                child is placed out of the child's home, if in the best interests of the child, preference may be given to placing the child with the child's grandparent who is appropriate, capable, willing, and available to care for the
                                child. The court may make reasonable orders as conditions of said release and may provide that any violation of such orders shall subject the child or the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to contempt sanctions
                                of the court. The parent or other person to whom the child is released may be required to sign a written promise, on forms supplied by the court, to bring the child to the court at a time set or to be set by the court.

                                It is beneficial for a child who is removed from his or her home and placed in foster care to be able to continue relationships with his or her brothers and sisters, regardless of age, in order that the siblings may share their strengths and association
                                in their everyday and often common experiences. The general assembly also finds that the initial decisions about temporary placement of a child may affect the ultimate permanent placement of the child or of the children
                                in a sibling group.

                                finds that if the county department locates an appropriate, capable, willing, and available joint placement for all of the children in the sibling group, there should be a rebuttable presumption that placement of the entire
                                sibling group in the joint placement is in the best interests of the children. Such presumption should be rebuttable by a preponderance of the evidence that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is
                                not in the best interests of a child or of the children.

                        of the child.

                    <p>
                        The state is the exclusive party to bring neglect and dependency proceedings. A private person, such as a grandparent, can request the county department of social services to bring such a proceeding or refer the matter to the juvenile court, as provided
                        in subsection (2), but she cannot bring a neglect and dependency petition on her own. McCall v. Dist. Court ex rel. County of Montezuma, 651 P.2d 392 (Colo. 1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While a grandparent can report suspected child abuse or neglect and, thereby, initiate an investigation, this section does not require that the court undertake its own investigation by granting a hearing at the request of a grandparent, nor does this
                        section require that the court order the county department of social services to conduct an additional investigation if it appears that a preliminary investigation has already been completed and the county department saw no need
                        to pursue the matter. In re L.F., 121 P.3d 267 (Colo. App. 2005).

                    <p>
                        "Petition" signifies initial pleading of dependency or neglect requesting the court to take jurisdiction rather than discussion of termination of parental rights appearing in a social worker's report. People in Interest of H.A.C. v. D.C.C., 198

                    <p>
                        Age is a jurisdictional prerequisite both at the filing of a petition and at the time of adjudication. In a case where the child was just shy of 18 at the time the dependency and neglect petition was filed but turned 18 before the hearing, the juvenile
                        court lost subject matter jurisdiction by the time of the hearing. People in Interest of M.C.S.,

                        A petition which shows on its face that the child is neither dependent nor delinquent deprives the court of jurisdiction. Carrera v. Kelley, 131

        Colo. 421

                    <p>
                        That the mother of a child is convicted of a felony, and leaves the child in the care of its grandmother who is giving it proper care, does not invoke the jurisdiction of a juvenile court in a dependency proceeding, and speculation as to the future conduct
                        of the mother has no place in such proceedings. Diernfeld v. People, 137

                        In a proceeding to declare a child dependent and neglected, initiated under former section by parties having temporary care of the child, there being no evidence that the child was at any time in improper hands or in unwholesome surroundings, and the
                        petition showing on its face that its purpose was to secure a continuation of the situation existing at the time the action was commenced, no grounds for dependency existed. Wellbrink v. Walden, 142

                        The mere act of dismissing the petition does not decree custody of the child, for custody in dependency cases can only be determined after the child has been decreed dependent and neglected. Jones v. Koulos, 142

                        A petition in dependency must be filed, not in behalf of any individual, but only in behalf of the state for the purpose of protecting a minor child. Such petition should not be filed by any petitioner, and particularly not by an attorney at law, who
                        is an officer of the court, except singly for the protection of the child. Everett v. Barry, 127

                        Petition essential for jurisdiction. Without a petition in writing setting forth all the facts concerning what constitutes the child a dependent and verified by the affidavit of the petitioner, a juvenile court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter.

                        A petition in dependency should be filed only upon credible information and belief that the child is so circumstanced that for its own protection and well-being it should be taken from existing custody and become a ward of the state. Everett v. Barry,

                    <p>
                        Petitioner should not file a petition without knowledge of facts justifying belief of dependency and, when the petition is filed, should see that evidence is presented supporting it. Peterson v. Schwartzmann, 116

                        One assuming to sign a petition equally assumes the obligation to present evidence sustaining it, and one should not verify any allegation of such a petition as true of his own knowledge, unless the facts set forth therein are within his personal knowledge.

                        In addition to the other requirements for jurisdiction, the essential element in all cases is that the petitioner have knowledge of a child in his county who appears to be dependent. Geisler v. People, 135

                        Petition did not cover children born subsequently. A petition verified on a certain date, covering the facts as of that date, cannot cover children born at a later date. Any order entered on such a petition regarding support is void, and consequently,
                        all subsequent orders are likewise void. Kearney v. Blue, 134

                            The adjudication procedure allows parents with limited financial ability to obtain proper treatment for their developmentally disabled children, and thereby furthers the legislative purpose of securing for such children the care that will best serve their
                            welfare and the interests of society. The best interests of the child, rather than the parents' finances, determine what care the child receives. M.S. v. People, 812 P.2d 632 (Colo. 1991).

                        <p>
                            Adjudication of dependency and neglect was proper where father had been bound over for trial on charge of murder of mother and held without bond because child could be found dependent and neglected under the ground that she lacked parental care or was
                            not domiciled with her parent. People in Interest of S.B., 742 P.2d 935 (Colo. App. 1987), cert. denied, 754 P.2d 1177 (Colo. 1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Was also proper where the jury verdict was based on allegations in the petition in dependency and neglect; the only argument presented to support the finding of dependency was the allegation in the petition of the act of sexual molestation initially told
                            to a pediatrician by the child and subsequently investigated by the department of social services; the father did not contend that the jury's determination rested on some unknown other incident and not the sole allegation concerning
                            him; and the verdict was intended to be a determination of the status of the child, and not a specific finding of the acts creating that status. People in Interest of K.G., 876 P.2d 1 (Colo. App. 1993).

                            Admission by one respondent not necessarily dispositive of allegations disputed by any other respondents. One party's admissions, while binding upon that party, are legally insufficient to establish the allegations in a dependency and neglect petition
                            in the face of the other party's denial. People ex rel. U.S., 121 P.3d 326 (Colo. App. 2005).

                        <p>
                            "Fault" admissions made by father involving mother, which she denied and which were not proved at an adjudicatory hearing, cannot form the basis for requiring mother to comply with a treatment plan in the absence of an adjudication. People ex rel. U.S.,

                            Admission by a mother with whom children did not reside that child had been assaulted and lacked proper parental care is not sufficient to sustain an adjudication of dependency and neglect against a father who disputed such allegations and demanded a
                            jury trial. People in Interest of A.M., 786 P.2d 476 (Colo. App. 1989).

                        <p>
                            Purpose of hearing. The purpose of the adjudicatory hearing is to determine whether the facts show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the child is in fact neglected and dependent. People in Interest of K.S., 33
                            <cite class="cocode">
         Colo. App. 72, 515 P.2d 130

                        <p>
                            The primary purpose of a dependency adjudication is to furnish the jurisdictional bases for state intervention to assist the parents and child in establishing a relationship and home environment that will preserve the family unit. People in Interest of

                        <p>
                            An adjudicatory hearing on dependency or neglect is designed to determine whether the child, for whatever reason, lacks the benefit of parental guidance, concern, protection or support to which he is entitled. People in Interest of E.A., 638 P.2d 278
                            (Colo. 1981).

                        <p>
                            A determination of dependency and neglect must be based on a consideration of existing circumstances and not on speculation concerning future possibilities. People in Interest of C.T., 746 P.2d 56 (Colo. App. 1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            State has burden of proof. Where a mother files a petition asking the state to seek a determination of dependency and neglect, in order to gain the relief requested, the state has the burden of establishing the assertion thereon that the children are
                            "neglected or dependent". In re People in Interest of E.F.C., 30
                            <cite class="cocode">

                        <p>
                            Dependency requires preponderance of proof. It is only necessary to prove the allegations of the petition alleging children to be dependent and neglected in a custody hearing by a preponderance of the evidence. Robinson v. People in Interest of Zollinger,

                            In an action to declare children dependent or neglected, petitioner must prove the elements by a preponderance of the evidence. In re People in Interest of R.K., 31

                        <p>
                            Preponderance of evidence standard does not violate due process. Subsection (1), which permits a dependency adjudication under the preponderance of evidence standard, does not violate due process of law. People in Interest of O.E.P., 654 P.2d 312 (Colo.

                            Where petitioner was deprived of significant parental rights that did not amount to a permanent termination of the parent-child relationship, her constitutional due process rights were not violated by the application of a preponderance of the evidence
                            standard. While the court's order granted custody of the petitioner's children to the department, appointed the foster parents as permanent legal guardians, and ordered that the petitioner was to have no contact with her children
                            until they were over 18, the trial court did retain jurisdiction over the case until the children were 21 and the petitioner retained the right to consent or withhold consent to adoption, the right to reasonable parenting time
                            except as restricted by the court, and the right to determine the children's religious affiliation. L.L. v. People, 10 P.3d 1271 (Colo. 2000).

                            This section does not lessen or shift the burden of proof. It allows the trial court to submit a case to the jury once the petitioner has presented a prima facie case, i.e., evidence that nonaccidental injury has occurred, and if the jury finds the children
                            are neglected or dependent, that prima facie evidence shall be sufficient to uphold the jury's determination. People in Interest of M.A.L., 37

                            The legal presumption is that natural parents are entitled to the custody of their children unless otherwise clearly established. Carrera v. Kelley, 131

                            The Troxel presumption will ordinarily survive a deferred adjudication because a deferred adjudication is not final as to the merits of the allegations set forth in the dependency and neglect petition, especially where the determination is based only

                            The statutory criteria for adjudicating a child as dependent or neglected satisfies Troxel and does not require that the court find that both parents are unavailable, unable, or unwilling to provide reasonable parental care prior to adjudication. Adjudicatory
                            proceedings are distinct from termination proceedings, and each has different goals and requirements. By requiring the state to prove that neither parent was available, able, and willing to provide reasonable parental care,
                            the trial court erred in unnecessarily conflating the statutory dependency and neglect criteria with the termination criteria. People in Interest of J.G., 2016 CO 39, 370 P.3d 1151.

                            The single fact that a father has ceased making support payments to the mother for those children on whose behalf the state is invoking the doctrine of parens patriae does not establish that the children are "neglected or dependent". This is particularly
                            true where the father is acting under what he considers to be a controlling order of court which placed custody of the children with him. Under these circumstances, there is no showing that the father is failing or refusing
                            to perform his obligations toward the children. In re People in Interest of E.F.C., 30

                        providing prior notice thereof is given, the dispositional hearing may be had coextensively with the adjudicatory hearing. When the latter alternative is followed, it is necessary that there be presented at the hearing evidence

                        Grandmother's standing as interested party. While grandmother, who petitioned for custody of children who had been adjudicated dependent and neglected, but who had failed to enter the proceeding in which the adjudication had been made, had no "right"

                        In order to terminate parental rights (now parent-child legal relationship), the trial court must find that the condition which results in the determination that the child is dependent and neglected will in all probability continue into the future and
                        the court must further find that under no reasonable circumstances can the welfare of the child be served by a continuation of the parent-child relationship. People in Interest of M.B., 188

                        A court may hold a dispositional hearing and find that no appropriate treatment plan can be devised for a parent after it has already approved an initial treatment plan for the parent at a prior hearing. The purposes of the Children's Code -- to preserve

                        within thirty days after the adjudication and shall not grant a delay unless good cause is shown and unless the court finds that the best interests of the child will be served by granting the delay. It is the intent of the general
                        assembly that the dispositional hearing be held on the same day as the adjudicatory hearing, whenever possible. If a delay is granted, the court shall set forth the reasons why a delay is necessary and the minimum amount of time
                        needed to resolve the reasons for the delay and shall schedule the hearing at the earliest possible time following the delay. When the proposed disposition is termination of the parent-child legal relationship, the hearing on termination

                        of parens patriae, and the matter for determination is what will serve the best interests of the child. This is the rule which prevails in Colorado and elsewhere in child custody cases. Robinson v. People in Interest of Zollinger,

                        (1) there has been a history of severe and continuous neglect by the parent whose rights are sought to be terminated; (2) there is a substantial probability of future deprivation; and (3) under no reasonable circumstances can the welfare of the child

                        Fact insufficient to terminate rights. That the ongoing relationship of parent and child may not presently be a positive factor in the child's environment or development is insufficient, in and of itself, to warrant termination of parental rights in a

                        Due process requires that respondent father be given notice of termination proceedings, an opportunity to be heard or defend, and to have the assistance of legal counsel. Because respondent had the opportunity to appear through court-appointed counsel,

                    <p>
                        Due process requires notice of hearing. Despite the fact that this section contains no notice requirement, due process requires that a parent receive adequate notice of a termination hearing and an opportunity to protect his interests at the hearing.

                        Absence of notice provision in statute does not violate due process. Where parent had been given adequate notice of the hearing, the absence of a notice provision in the statute is not a violation of due process. People in Interest of M.M., 726 P.2d 1108

                        Failure to hold a hearing within 120 days does not warrant reversal because the statutory time in which to conduct a termination hearing is not jurisdictional. People ex rel. D.M., 186 P.3d 101 (Colo. App. 2008).

                        In determining whether an indigent parent has the right to appointed counsel in a termination proceeding resulting from a dependency and neglect adjudication, a court is to consider whether (1) the parent's interest is an extremely important one; (2)
                        the state shares with the parent an interest in a correct decision, has a relatively weak pecuniary interest, and, in some but not all cases, has a possibly stronger interest in informal procedures; and (3) the complexity of the
                        proceeding and the incapacity of the uncounselled parent could be, but would not always be, great enough to make the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent's rights insupportably high. In re C.A.O., 192 P.3d 508 (Colo.

                        The decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel for indigent parents in stepparent adoption proceedings must be answered in the first instance by the trial court, subject to appellate review. In re C.A.O., 192 P.3d 508 (Colo. App.

                        Court erroneously denied father his statutory right to counsel by effectively dismissing counsel by entering a default judgment against father without father being present. The erroneous denial of father's statutory right to counsel during a substantial
                        part of a parental rights termination hearing constituted reversible error per se under the circumstances presented. People ex rel. R.D.,

                        filed and concedes that he earned too much money to qualify for state-paid counsel under judicial guidelines but complains that he should have received an application form to establish indigency after the motion to terminate was
                        filed; rather, it was father's duty to request indigency status again, if he so desired. People ex rel. M.C., 94 P.3d 1220 (Colo. App. 2004).

                        Court must follow the prejudice test in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims in termination of parental rights proceedings. To establish prejudice from counsel's deficient performance in a dependency
                        and neglect proceeding, a party must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. People in Interest of A.R., 2020 CO 10, 456

                        It was not a violation of father's equal protection right when sheriff failed to transport him at state expense to parental termination hearing. No group of individuals is entitled by law to be transported to these hearings. Indigent non-incarcerated
                        individuals are thus not granted special preference over indigent incarcerated individuals. Hence, the trial court ruling does not create a classification nor have special impact on father. People in Interest of C.G., 885 P.2d

                        unlikelihood of change in the future, a termination of parental rights is not violative of equal protection under the law. People in Interest of M.M., 726 P.2d 1108 (Colo. 1986).

                        A written adjudicatory order, a minute order reflecting the approval of a treatment plan, and a copy of the treatment plan are sufficient to establish for purposes of subsection (1)(c) that the children were adjudicated dependent or neglected. That the
                        adjudicatory order did not become appealable until the judgment of termination was entered does not undermine or affect either its validity or its probative value. People ex rel. J.M., 74 P.3d 475 (Colo. App. 2003).

                        accepted that admission, and mother voluntarily participated in the termination proceedings without objecting to the absence of an adjudicatory order, thereby waiving any procedural error arising from subsection (1)(c). People

                        Treatment plan required even though parent incarcerated. The fact that a particular parent is incarcerated at the time of an adjudication of dependency or neglect may often render more difficult the crafting of a meaningful and workable treatment plan.
                        However, such single circumstance does not per se prohibit the creation and implementation of a treatment program appropriate for the goal the general assembly has indicated it should achieve -- the building or rebuilding of a

                        Treatment plan was an "appropriate treatment plan" within meaning of statute requiring court to find that an appropriate treatment plan approved by court has not been complied with by parent or has not been successful to terminate parent-child legal relationship.

                        In deciding whether to terminate parental rights, the juvenile court should consider whether reasonable accommodations were made for a parent's disability when determining whether the treatment plan was appropriate and reasonable efforts were made to
                        rehabilitate the parent. What constitutes a reasonable accommodation is based on an individual assessment. Further, in considering whether reasonable accommodations can be made for a parent's disability, the paramount concern must
                        remain the child's health and safety. The requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act do not protect a parent who, even by virtue of his or her disability, poses a safety risk to the child. People in Interest of

                        Information from previous hearings may be considered. There is no prohibition by statute or common law that would prohibit a trial court from considering information gleaned from previous hearings on unsuccessful petitions to terminate parent-child relationships
                        when making determinations of fact in resolving a pending petition to terminate the relationship. However, additional facts are required to justify a trial court's change in its conclusions from a previous hearing at which it refused

                        Termination of the parental relationship for children of native American status is governed by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) and the standard under that act is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. People in Interest of C.A.J., 709 P.2d

                        "Active efforts" under the federal ICWA means more than reasonable efforts but does not mean persisting with futile efforts. The department of human services is not required to provide active efforts to a parent who voluntarily absents himself or herself

                        The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is not a defense at parental rights termination proceedings. The focus of the hearing is on the welfare of the child. Regardless of the parent's special needs or restricted capabilities, the child is entitled
                        to a minimum level of parental care. People ex rel. T.B., 12 P.3d 1221 (Colo. App. 2000).

                    <p>
                        The ADA does not categorically pre-empt section. If the court determines that an appropriate treatment plan cannot be devised to address the unfitness of parents with multiple mental health diagnoses so that the child's minimum level of care is provided,
                        then it is justified in terminating the parent-child relationship. The ADA cannot be raised as a defense to such a termination of parental rights. People in Interest of C.Z.,

                        Statute need not enunciate all factors which may lead to termination. Fundamental fairness does not require a statute to enunciate in all-encompassing examples, or exactly described acts, precisely how poorly a parent can treat a child before risking

                        Subsection (1), when read as a whole and applying ordinary meaning to the language, permits termination so long as at least one of the statutory grounds has been established by clear and convincing evidence but does not limit the court to only one statutory

                        The court may still consider mother's incarceration under subsection (2) even though she was eligible for parole in fewer than 36 months following the child's adjudication. That subsection requires the court to consider incarceration if a parent must
                        wait longer than 36 months before becoming eligible for parole, but it does not preclude the court from considering the effect of a lesser period of incarceration. People in Interest of M.H., 10 P.3d 713 (Colo. App. 2000).

                        A court may consider parental incarceration as a factor in determining parental fitness and, thereby, as a factor affecting the needs of a child who has been adjudicated dependent or neglected. If a parent cannot be expected to provide a stable home atmosphere
                        for the child within a reasonable period, the state's compelling interest in the welfare of the subject child justifies the termination of that parent's rights. K.D. v. People, 139 P.3d 695 (Colo. 2006).

                        Where there is no indication that father was asked to address any potential causes of children's trauma other than the criminal charges of which he was acquitted, the juvenile court erred in concluding that father's failure to address other possible issues,
                        and the children's corresponding trauma, demonstrated that he was an unfit parent. Thus, granting custody of the children to mother was not a viable less drastic alternative to termination. People in Interest of L.M.,

                        Juvenile court's order to retain legal custody of children in department, appoint foster parents as permanent legal guardians, direct that children have no further contact with mother, and retain continuing jurisdiction is not the functional equivalent
                        of a termination of mother's parental rights. Judge's order is supported by the record, but leaves open the possibility that mother could seek a modification of order to regain custody or obtain parenting time or other relief.

                        While department and trial court must consider remedies less drastic than termination, this means that the department must evaluate a reasonable number of persons suggested to it as possible placements by the family and other interested persons, but nothing
                        requires the department to make special inquiry and independently identify and evaluate other possible placements within or outside the family. Father's testimony at termination hearing that other relatives might be interested
                        in caring for the child, with no indication that father identified any of these relatives to the department or the court, was insufficient to require the department to explore these family members as options. People ex rel. D.B-J.,

                        While placement with a grandparent who is available and appropriate is given statutory preference if such placement is in the child's best interests, placement with a grandparent is not a viable alternative to termination if the grandparent lacks appreciation
                        of the parent's problems or of the child's needs. People ex rel. D.B-J., 89 P.3d 530 (Colo. App. 2004).

                        Trial court did not err in rejecting placement with the paternal grandmother as a less drastic alternative to termination when findings indicate that grandmother did not interact well with the child; that the child had an ambivalent attachment to the
                        grandmother; that the grandmother was not interested in participating in treatment to address her relationship with the child; and that the grandmother was unlikely to comply with no contact orders. People ex rel. D.B-J., 89 P.3d

                        Determination of indigency lies within the discretion of the trial court. Where a party has failed to provide documentation of indigency as ordered by the trial court, the court may deny such party a free transcript and such denial is not error. People

                        A party who proceeded as an indigent in the trial court may proceed as an indigent on appeal without further authorization unless the court finds, in writing, that the party is no longer entitled to so proceed. The trial court may order the production
                        of any documents or evidence it deems necessary to determine continuing indigency. People in Interest of M.N., 950 P.2d 674 (Colo. App. 1997).

                        The general assembly finds that, for various reasons, some children are not adopted after the termination or voluntary relinquishment of the parent-child legal relationship and in some cases might benefit from a reinstatement of the parent-child legal
                        relationship if the former parent has remediated the issues that led to the termination or voluntary relinquishment. The purpose of this section is to address the problem of children who linger in the child welfare system by giving
                        them a second chance at achieving permanency with their rehabilitated former parent. The purpose of this section is to create a process by which the former parent's legal rights may be restored if certain conditions are met, both
                        the child and the former parent want reinstatement of the relationship, a trial period is successful, and it is found to be in the best interests of the child. Reinstatement is a recognition that the situation of the former parent
                        and child has changed since the time of the termination or voluntary relinquishment of the parent-child legal relationship, and reunification is now appropriate and in the best interests of the child.

                        for reinstatement set forth in subsection (9) of this section have been met and that it is in the best interests of the child to work toward reinstatement of the parent-child legal relationship. If the court finds that it is in
                        the best interests of the child to pursue reinstatement of the parent-child legal relationship, the court must approve a transition plan developed by the county department and designed for reinstatement of the parent-child legal
                        relationship, including visitation or placement of the child with the former parent for a designated trial period of up to six months, during which time legal custody of the child remains with the county department. As part of
                        the transition plan, the county department shall provide transition services, as needed. The county department shall assess the visitation or temporary placement of the child with the former parent and prepare a report about the
                        success of the visitation or temporary placement. The county department shall submit the report to the court, the former parent, and the guardian ad litem not later than thirty days prior to the expiration of the designated trial
                        period. The county department may stop the visitation or remove the child from placement with the former parent at any time, in accordance with the procedures outlined in sections 19-3-401 and 19-3-403, if it deems that the child
                        is not safe or that it is no longer in the best interests of the child for the child to remain with the former parent.

                                Colorado has a strong interest in preserving and strengthening family ties and reducing separation trauma to children who are removed from their birth parents;

                                The removal and subsequent continued separation between child and birth parent makes sustaining primary relationships difficult and reunification more problematic, and the loss a child experiences when separated from his or her birth parent or parents
                                is profound, sometimes lasting into adulthood;

                                For these reasons, it is important to establish clear standards to achieve consistent practices relating to the availability of high-quality parenting time for children who have been removed from a birth parent by government action; and

                                Clear standards and consistent practices will help ensure that all parents and children have a fair process for determining a parenting time plan that is in the best interests of children and that promotes positive outcomes for families.

                        Therefore, the general assembly declares that it is valuable to create a task force of persons with experience in or knowledge of the child welfare policy system to examine the current policies and statutes governing parenting time, to study best practices
                        for the provision of and determination of individualized plans for parenting time, and to make recommendations to the executive branch and to the general assembly on administrative and legislative changes to support high-quality
                        parenting time in Colorado.

                        No provision for father not married to married natural mother to establish paternity. This article makes no provision for a male claiming to be the natural father of a child to bring an action to establish his paternity under circumstances where he was
                        not married to the natural mother and the child was born to the natural mother during her marriage to another. R. McG. v. J.W., 200

                    As used in this article, "parent and child relationship" means the legal relationship existing between a child and his natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights, privileges, duties, and obligations. "Parent and child
                    relationship" includes the mother and child relationship and the father and child relationship.

                        The definition of a "parent and child relationship" applies to a parent and child relationship once it has been declared and clarifies that it is the legal equivalent of the traditional relationships recognized between children and their adoptive or natural
                        parents. A presumed father's admission that he is not the biological parent does not necessarily rebut the presumption of fatherhood that arises by receiving the child into his home and openly holding that child out as his natural
                        child when no judgment has been entered that establishes the paternity of another man. In re A.D., 240 P.3d 488 (Colo. App. 2010).

                        Nothing in the statutory provisions, whether read separately or together, provides that an admission by a man seeking parental rights that he is not the child's biological father conclusively rebuts the presumption under this section. A presumed father's
                        admission that he is not the biological parent does not necessarily rebut the presumption of fatherhood that arises by receiving the child into his home and openly holding that child out as his natural child when no judgment has

                        When presumptions of paternity arise in more than one potential father, trial courts must take the best interests of the child into account as part of policy and logic in resolving competing presumptions. N.A.H. v. S.L.S., 9 P.3d 354 (Colo. 2000); In

                        The evidentiary standard for determining the weightier considerations of policy and logic is preponderance of the evidence. Once competing presumptions of fatherhood have been established that have not been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the
                        court must resolve the issue of paternity by considering the best interests of the child and determining the weightier issues of policy and logic by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard. People ex rel. C.L.S., 313

                        Purpose of article. The purpose of the paternity article of the Colorado Children's Code is to provide a means to establish accurately the identity of the father of the child so that the responsibility for support of the child can be determined and support

                        Different limitation periods for support and paternity not violative of equal protection. When a former statute provided that no proceeding to establish paternity or furnish support should be initiated after a child was five years old unless the father
                        had acknowledged paternity in writing or by furnishing support, whereas proceedings to compel fathers of illegitimate children or other legally responsible persons to support a child might be filed any time before the child's eighteenth
                        birthday, there was no violation of the equal protection clause. In re People in Interest of L.B., 179

                        There was no ambiguity in the wording of articles 6 and 7 of the Colorado Children's Code. It was quite clear that paternity and support issues were to be determined under article 6 and article 7 was to be used only for the determination of support where
                        paternity was not in dispute. It was error for the court to have conducted a paternity proceeding under the petition for support proceedings of article 7. People in Interest of L.B., 29 Colo. App. 101, 482 P.2d 1010 (1970), aff'd,

                        Paternity determination precedes support obligation. Before a duty to support can be imposed, it must first be established that the person upon whom the support obligation is to be imposed is, in truth, the father of the child. In re People in Interest

                        The statute does not limit the time within which a presumed father may assert as a defense the nonexistence of the father and child relationship. Consequently, this case falls squarely within the general rule that a statute of limitations although barring
                        the use of a claim for affirmative relief after the limitations period has run, is not a bar to asserting that claim as a defense. People in Interest of R.T.L., 780 P.2d 508 (Colo. 1989); People in Interest of L.J., 835 P.2d 1265

                        District court lacks jurisdiction to resolve matters in a paternity action unless each man presumed to be the children's father and each man alleged to be the children's natural father are made parties to or given notice of the action. In re Support of

                        Absent special circumstances, once a determination of paternity has been made and permanent orders entered resolving custody, child support, and parenting time, the appointment of the guardian ad litem terminates. The Uniform Parentage Act is ambiguous
                        as to the length of the guardian ad litem's appointment and there is no reason why the child and parents should suffer the expense and continued invasion of privacy caused by the indefinite appointment of a guardian ad litem, although
                        the court may conclude that appointment of a guardian is necessary for a limited purpose or duration when issues are raised after the entry of permanent orders. In Interest of A.R.W., 903 P.2d 10 (Colo. App. 1994).

                        Common-law rule of testimony of parties. The common-law rule prohibiting a husband or wife from testifying to nonaccess in filiation cases first arose in the middle of the 18th century. Colorado adopted the common law of England as it existed prior to
                        the announcement of that rule. Vasquez v. Esquibel, 141
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 5

                    <p>
                        There is a presumption of legitimacy of children born to a married woman. Vasquez v. Esquibel, 141
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 5

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such presumption may be overcome by evidence of nonaccess of the husband during the period when conception occurred, and it is error to reject such evidence in an action to establish paternity of a child. Vasquez v. Esquibel, 141
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 5

                    <p>
                        Burden of proof. If the presumption of legitimacy of children born to a married woman is overcome, it would still be incumbent on a petitioner to establish to the satisfaction of a trial court that a respondent was the father of a child, but he cannot
                        rely on the outmoded and archaic conclusiveness of a presumption in the light of facts which a petitioner offers to prove. Vasquez v. Esquibel, 141
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 5

                    <p>
                        Preponderance of proof required. The trial court's instruction to the effect that petitioner must prove paternity by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than by clear and convincing evidence, correctly stated the law. McCoy v. People in Interest of
                        Minor Child, 165
                        <cite class="co_code">

                    <p>
                        Prima facie case established. In a proceeding to determine paternity of a child, a petitioner's testimony of acts of intercourse with respondent and her pregnancy following and birth of the child within the permissible period is sufficient to establish
                        a prima facie case and require submission of the issues to a jury. Medina v. Gonzales, 141

                        Evidence of specific resemblance is probative of paternity and should be admitted, but only when presented by a qualified expert witness who relates to the jury those characteristics which bear on paternity. People in Interest of R.D.S., 183

                        Scientific foundation for evidence of specific resemblance. Unlike evidence of general resemblance, there is a firm scientific foundation for inferring parentage from the existence of evidence of specific resemblance. People in Interest of R.D.S., 183

                        Human leukocyte antigen test admissible on issue of paternity because it is capable of establishing either that an individual could not be the father of a certain child or that the probability that he is the father exceeds ninety percent. E.M.F. v. N.N.,

                        Exhibition of child is discretionary. In a paternity action, the question of whether the child is to be exhibited before the trier of fact is a discretionary matter on the part of the trial court, and its determination will be upheld on review in the
                        absence of an abuse of that discretion. In re People in Interest of R.D.S., 32 Colo. App. 26, 507 P.2d 481, aff'd, 183
                        <cite class="co_code">

                    <p>
                        Refusal to allow such exhibition upheld. Where the court ruled in a paternity action that exhibition of the child would have been of no probative value, and appellant made no offer of proof and advanced no argument that could have been a basis for the
                        reviewing court to determine that the trial court was in error, and where the existence of the child was not in dispute, and ample evidence was presented to support a verdict for or against either party, there was no abuse of discretion
                        in the court's ruling. In re People in Interest of R.D.S., 32 Colo. App. 26, 507 P.2d 481, aff'd, 183
                        <cite class="co_code">

                    <p>
                        Exhibition of child for purpose of showing general resemblance denies right to cross-examination. Exhibition of a child to the jury in a paternity action for the purpose of showing general resemblance without expert testimony effectively denies the respondent
                        the right of cross-examination, because the mere exhibition of a child without comment leaves a jury with the uncontroverted inference of similarities between such child and the alleged father. People in Interest of R.D.S., 183
                        <cite class="co_code">

                        And is of questionable probative value and irrelevant. Because the probative force of evidence of general resemblance is questionable, yet gives rise to the conflicting interest of undue jury sympathy, prejudice, and confusion, exhibition of a child to
                        jury, when offered to show paternity by way of general resemblance is irrelevant as a matter of law. People in Interest of R.D.S., 183

                        Former section constitutional. Former section compelling a father to support unborn child and its mother was constitutional. Cederquist v. Archuleta, 127

                        Former statute which provided for assessment of damages held unconstitutional and would not support a judgment of damages. This did not relieve the father of an illegitimate child of his obligation to support the child since the finding of the jury as
                        to the father of the child involved stood. Loveland v. Lewis, 169

                        Law liberally interpreted. Where the paternity of the child is established beyond question, the law should be liberally construed to insure the necessary help to the child and its mother, consonant with the father's ability to pay. Davis v. People, 103

                    <p>
                        The primary issue for determination in a paternity case is whether the alleged father is, in fact, the father. A.R.B. v. G.L.P., 180

                        Determination of status of child is conclusive. A proceeding to determine the parentage of a child is in the direct interest of the child and the status of the child as to its parentage determined in such a proceeding is just as conclusive and binding
                        upon the child as it would be upon a parent brought into court under the provisions of the statute. In re Morrow's Estate, 100

                        The general assembly hereby finds that parental relinquishment and adoption of children are important and necessary options to facilitate the permanent placement of minor children if the birth parents are unable or unwilling to provide proper parental
                        care. The general assembly further finds that adoption offers significant psychological, legal, economic, and social benefits not only for children who might otherwise be homeless but also for parents who are unable to care for
                        their children and for adoptive parents who desire children to nurture, care for, and support. Conversely, the general assembly recognizes that disrupted adoptive placements often have a profound and negative impact on individuals,
                        particularly children, involved in the adoption proceedings.

                        It is the purpose of this article 5 to promote the integrity and finality of adoptions to ensure that children placed in adoptive placements will be raised in stable, loving, and permanent families. It is the further intent of the general assembly that
                        a prospective parent with a disability should not be denied the opportunity to provide a permanent adoptive placement for a child based solely on the parent's disability, as provided for in section 24-34-805 (2). The general assembly
                        intends that by enacting this legislation, it will be protecting children from being uprooted from adoptive placements and from the life-long emotional and psychological trauma that often accompanies being indiscriminately moved.

                        Paternal rights (now parent-child legal relationships) may be forfeited by abandonment of the child. Fulton v. Martensen, 129

                        Statutory relinquishment cannot be waived because it is a part of the court process in such matters. It is necessary in order that the parent be under the jurisdiction of the court where the other statutory provision of counseling and guidance can be
                        given. Fackerell v. District Court, 133

                        An attempt to relinquish a minor child to an individual is without any force or effect. Consent alone adds nothing in the way of giving jurisdiction to the court. Fackerell v. District Court, 133

                        The purpose of this section is to prevent the relinquishment of a child by parents who do not realize the seriousness and finality of their acts. It does not provide that the department of welfare or the court should argue with the parents concerning
                        the reasons for their relinquishment or seek to thwart the exercise of their free and voluntary will. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144

                        Void decree subject to collateral attack. Where statutory requirements are not met, the court cannot enter a valid adoption decree, and the decree is thereby absolutely void on its face and may be the subject of a collateral attack, and the lack of these
                        jurisdictional matters made the decree subject to an attack at any stage of the proceedings or after entry of judgment. The lack of jurisdiction is usually shown by the judgment roll, and in adoption cases the record constitutes
                        the judgment roll. Fackerell v. District Court, 133

                        Motion to vacate order of relinquishment properly denied. In a proceeding by the natural parents of a minor child to set aside a relinquishment and consent to adoption, where it is shown that the court had jurisdiction, and there being no allegation of
                        coercion, duress, or pressure exerted upon the parents to induce them to relinquish the child, a motion to vacate such consent was properly denied. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144

                        Time limit between petition and hearing. Although no time limit is prescribed by statute for hearing after the filing of a petition for the relinquishment and adoption of a minor child, reasonable time should elapse between the filing of the petition
                        and a hearing thereon, permitting the court to examine into the facts to determine whether relinquishment is advisable under the circumstances. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144

                        Only parties of record and their attorneys are granted access to reports under this section. Where grandparent was never a proper party of record and did not have standing to become one in the relinquishment proceeding, she and her counsel were properly

                        Standard of professional conduct in Colorado required attorney to discuss relinquishment counseling with his or her client in both in-state and out-of-state adoptions. Thus trial court properly submitted to the jury the issue of whether defendant attorney
                        breached a duty of care to plaintiffs. Boyd v. Garvert, 9 P.3d 1161 (Colo. App. 2000) (case arose prior to enactment of subsection (12)).

                        Statute does not bar a due process challenge to the termination of a parent's rights when the parent alleges a lack of notice or insufficient notice that results from the other parent's failure or refusal to identify him or her as a possible parent. District
                        court erred in strictly applying the statute of limitations on due process challenge when insufficient notice was given. In re J.M.A., 240 P.3d 547 (Colo. App. 2010).

                        Notice through publication inadequate where birth mother had knowledge of father's location. Birth mother's fraudulent misrepresentations to the court deprived birth father of his constitutional right to due process, thus making the judgment terminating
                        his parental rights void by default. In re C.L.S., 252 P.3d 556 (Colo. App. 2011).

                        The express purposes of the relinquishment and adoption statutes is to promote the integrity and finality of adoption. Court did not misconstrue this section in finding that the father was unable personally to assume custody of the child promptly. Matter

                        The general assembly intended that custody be given only if a parent can promptly assume ongoing parental responsibility for the child. Had the general assembly intended to allow a nonrelinquishing parent to avoid termination by making alternative custodial

                        Where a court finds that a parent is "not unfit", the court must begin with the presumption that the parent is acting in his or her child's best interests in seeking custody of the child, and that it is not in the child's best interests to terminate the
                        parent-child legal relationship or to award custody to another party. M.C. v. Adoption Choices of

                        To rebut that presumption, a party seeking to terminate the parent's rights and obtain or retain custody of the child must prove by clear and convincing evidence not only that the statutory criteria for termination of the parent's rights set forth in
                        subsection (3.1) and the criteria for an award of custody set forth in subsection (3.4) have been met, but also that it is not in the child's best interests to allow the parent-child legal relationship to remain intact nor to award
                        custody of the child to the parent. M.C. v. Adoption Choices of

                        If the court chooses to terminate the parent-child legal relationship and award custody to another party, then, in addition to making findings regarding satisfaction of the statutory criteria for termination and custody, the court must make findings as

                        Section does not authorize termination of the parent-child legal relationship of the other parent in anticipation of possible stepparent adoption. Statutes governing parental relinquishment and adoption must be read together in order to effectuate the
                        legislative intent and give consistent, harmonious, and sensible effect to all their parts. Thus, since mother wanted to keep her relationship intact but involuntarily end father's in order to make children available for stepparent
                        adoption, reliance on this section was inappropriate. In re D.S.L., 18 P.3d 856 (Colo. App. 2001).

                        Any defect in subject matter jurisdiction resulting from a parent not having custody of child at time of filing petition to terminate parental rights is cured by the filing of subsequent petitions to terminate by agency and adoptive parents. People in

                    <p>
                        Statute does not bar a due process challenge to the termination of a parent's rights when the parent alleges a lack of notice or insufficient notice that results from the other parent's failure or refusal to identify him or her as a possible parent. District
                        court erred in strictly applying the statute of limitations on due process challenge when insufficient notice was given. In re J.M.A., 240 P.3d 547 (Colo. App. 2010).

                        Father's motion for relief not time-barred because judgment was void. Where notice through publication was inadequate because birth mother made fraudulent misrepresentations to the court, birth father was deprived of his constitutional right to due process,
                        thus making the judgment terminating his parental rights void by default. The requirements of due process take precedence over statutory enactments. In re C.L.S., 252 P.3d 556 (Colo. App. 2011).

                        Trial court protected father's fundamental liberty interest in his children by applying a presumption in favor of preserving parental rights and making findings to overcome the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. While the supreme court did
                        not specifically hold that Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), applies to parental termination proceedings, the trial court afforded father Troxel's heightened due process requirements. In Interest of Baby A, 2015 CO 72, 363

                        The specific findings that a court must make before terminating parental rights, including a parent's failure to promptly take responsibility for his or her children and the best interests of the children, constitute special factors that, along with the
                        presumption in favor of the parent, satisfy Troxel's due process requirements. In Interest of Baby A, 2015 CO 72, 363 P.3d 193.

                            C.A.R. 3.4 does not violate plaintiff's constitutional right to equal protection because parents whose rights are terminated under this article of the Colorado Children's Code are not similarly situated to parents whose rights are terminated under article
                            3 of the code. C.A.R. 3.4 applies to parents subject to dependency and neglect proceedings under article 3 of the

        </cite> contemplates two types of adoptions. The first is an adoption in which the rights of the parents are terminated by the court or are relinquished by the parents, or by the child's guardian if the parents are
                            deceased. In such situation, final decree of adoption has effect of divesting the child's natural parents of all legal rights and obligations with respect to the child. The second is a "stepparent adoption", which constitutes
                            the only exception to the general rule that an adoption divests both of the child's parents of all legal rights and duties relating to the child. This exception applies only when custodial parent is married to the adopting
                            stepparent. Adoption of T.K.J., 931 P.2d 488 (Colo. App. 1996); In re D.S.L., 18 P.3d 856 (Colo. App. 2001).

                            Reading the plain language of this section in harmony with other statutes relating to adoption, children of same-sex couple whose parents were not married and whose parents did not intend to relinquish or terminate custody of children were not available

                            Petitioners lacked standing to seek custodial adoption after their temporary guardianship expired and they failed to provide proper notice to parents of hearing to extend guardianship. Although trial court extended temporary guardianship, that order was
                            void for lack of notice to mother and father, therefore, petitioners lacked standing as the child's legal guardian. In re Adoption of K.L.L. ex rel. V.M.D., 160 P.3d 383 (Colo. App. 2007).

                            Responsibility of state to protect child's best interests. In an adoption proceeding, not only the custody, support, and education of a minor is involved, but one or both the parents may be deprived of their rights as parents. In such cases the state
                            has an obligation to see that the best interests of the child and its welfare are served by the decree of adoption. Clerkin v. Geisendorfer, 137

                        <p>
                            The primary consideration in adoption proceedings is the welfare of the child, and secondly the rights of the parents. Moreau v. Buchholz, 124
                            <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 302

                        <p>
                            Except when it is essential and of paramount necessity in the best interests of the child itself to provide otherwise, the law recognizes and enforces the right to the custody of their own children which nature gives to parents. Allen v. Huffman, 135

         Colo. 1

                            In a valid adoption proceeding, the natural relationship of the parents is superseded by an artificial relationship, and courts should act with caution and circumspection in such proceedings, exerting every effort commensurate with the welfare of the
                            child to prevail upon the natural parents to accept and fulfill their duties toward their child. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144

                            As child is ward of state. The initiation of any proceedings in a court in which the rights, status, and welfare of an infant may be affected immediately establishes the infant's relation to the court as that of its ward. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144

                            The power of the state to sever the ties between parent and child should be exercised with extreme care and only when the evidence clearly establishes the necessity of so doing. People in Interest of S.S.T., 38

                            In assessing whether a parent has abandoned a child, the court must examine the totality of the circumstances, viewed in light of the best interests of the child, which assessment must include recognition both that every child is entitled to support and

                            Where mother abandoned the child and did not have a relationship with the child, the court cannot benefit the best interests of the child by considering the prospects that the mother, having abandoned a child, may later seek to establish a relationship
                            with the child where there has been no support and nurturance. In re Petition of J.D.K., 37 P.3d 541 (Colo. App. 2001).

                            time period father's legal actions demonstrated that he did not intend to permanently abandon his rights with respect to the child. In re J.A.V., 206 P.3d 467 (Colo. App. 2009).

                            Abandonment inquiry focuses on intent. Court must determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the parent's intent during the twelve months preceding the filing of the petition for adoption was to abandon the child. The abandonment determination
                            is a question of fact best determined by the trial court, and the appellate court erred in holding, essentially as a matter of law, that father's filing of the parenting-time motions prior to the filing of the adoption petition
                            precluded a finding of intent to abandon. D.P.H. v. J.L.B., 260 P.3d 320 (Colo. 2011).

                            Natural father's motion to set aside stepparent adoption was properly denied where father knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily consented to his child's adoption by signing a waiver that was written in plain, clear, and unambiguous language. Father's
                            claim that his consent was based on an understanding that he would receive visitation rights was insufficient to overcome the written consent and evidence that the father was sufficiently informed by court clerk as to the consequences

                            Parent's incarceration. Incarceration is not a per se justification for failure to pay child support. The fact that a parent has been incarcerated for any or all of the 12-month period immediately preceding the filing of the petition is one factor to
                            be considered by the court in making its determinations. In re R.H.N., 673 P.2d 805 (Colo. App. 1983); In re R.H.N., 710 P.2d 482 (Colo. 1985).

                            Determination of whether reasonable support was paid must be predicated on a party's financial circumstances rather than on a rigid interpretation of a support order entered at a prior time. In re R.H.N., 678 P.2d 1070 (Colo. App. 1984).

                            But parents are not excused from their obligation to support their children merely because their incomes are small. Although incarceration is a factual circumstance that the court may consider in deciding what level of support is reasonable, incarceration
                            does not totally excuse a parent's obligation to provide some child support. In re R.H.N., 710 P.2d 482 (Colo. 1985).

                            Once court has determined that a natural parent has failed to provide child support during 12-month period preceding filing of petition under former subsection (1)(e)(II) (now subsection (1)(h)(II)), the court must look beyond the 12-month period to determine
                            whether there is any likelihood that natural parent will provide child support. In re R.H.N., 710 P.2d 482 (Colo. 1985).

                            a decree for a period of one year. In re F.J.H., 628 P.2d 159 (Colo. App. 1981).

                            Mistaken belief on support obligation considered in ruling on failure to provide support. While a divorced parent's support obligation is not legally suspended by the other parent's violation of the visitation provisions in a custody decree, a mistaken
                            belief to this effect is a factual circumstance which the trial court may consider in ruling on the question of the failure to provide reasonable support without cause in a proceeding which involves the termination of a parent-child

                            ad litem. However, the court may take judicial notice of its own records and adopt factual findings from a previous case involving the same parties and the same issues. In re C.A.B.L., 221 P.3d 433 (Colo. App. 2009).

                            This section applies simply to consent and not to waiver, and, in view of the expressed intent of the general assembly to give the natural parents protection from hurried and coerced decisions to give up their child, the meaning of this section cannot
                            be extended to include waiver of notice. Thus, the notice required may not be waived by a minor parent. Foley v. Carnesi, 123

                            The determination that a child is "available for adoption" is only a preliminary step toward the replacement of the child's natural parent with one who appears to be more willing and able to provide the care, support, and training necessary for the child's
                            proper development. People in Interest of S.S.T., 38

                            Objecting parent must show willingness to assume obligations. While a natural parent's rights may not be disregarded, expressed public policy declares that a parent seeking to prevent the adoption of his natural child by a stepparent may not stand upon
                            his parental rights without demonstrating a willingness to assume parental obligations. People in Interest of S.S.T., 38

                            <cite class="cocode">
         Colorado Children's Code specifies that failure to support without cause is a separate and independent ground from that of abandonment for declaring a child available for adoption so that if sufficient proof on either or both grounds is submitted to the court, a judgment based thereon will not be disturbed.

                            This section does not require that abandonment and nonsupport must both be shown to terminate parental rights (now parent-child legal relationship). Buder v. Reynolds, 175

                            Prior court order mandating child support is not a prerequisite to a finding that a natural parent has failed without cause to provide child support. Accordingly, a child could be adopted without the natural father's consent where the natural father had
                            failed to provide any child support for over a year preceding the filing for stepparent adoption, the evidence suggested that he would not pay child support in the future, and all procedural requirements of this section had
                            been met. In re I.R.D., 971 P.2d 702 (Colo. App. 1998).

                        <p>
                            In assessing whether a parent has abandoned a child, the court must examine the totality of the circumstances viewed in light of the best interests of the child, and mother's single phone call made during the year prior to the filing of the petition for
                            adoption would not preclude a finding of abandonment. In re Petition of J.D.K., 37 P.3d 541 (Colo. App. 2001).

                            Termination of parental rights (now parent-child legal relationship) constitutional. Requiring only a showing that the natural parent has failed without cause to provide reasonable support for a child for one year or more, when termination of a natural
                            parent's rights is sought in a stepparent adoption, does not violate the natural parent's constitutional rights. Buder v. Reynolds, 175

                            Minor parent may give consent. Under this section, the minority of a natural parent is not a bar to such parent's consent to adoption. Batton v. Massar, 149

                            A mother's consent to the adoption is necessary unless she has forfeited her rights. Graham v. Francis, 83

                        <p>
                            When the petition in adoption was filed, there was no valid order of dependency. Without such a valid order the consent of the mother was essential, and not being filed with that petition, the court was without jurisdiction to enter the decree of adoption,
                            and its jurisdiction was no greater because of the subsequent order of dependency based on a new petition. The adjudication of dependency entered subsequent to the filing of the petition in adoption could not give vitality
                            to the adoption petition. Storey v. Shumaker, 131

                            Unverified consent ineffective. Where the written consent of the natural parent is not subscribed and sworn to as required by this section, a decree of adoption will not be sustained. Allen v. Huffman, 135

                            Consent valid in absence of fraud, coercion, or misrepresentation. A mother may not avoid the consequences of her voluntary acts in consenting to the adoption of her children, on the ground that she did not realize the seriousness and finality of the
                            paper she was signing, in the absence of fraud, coercion, or misrepresentation. Batton v. Massar, 149

                            After relinquishment, parental consent unnecessary. If there has been a relinquishment, then in proceedings for the adoption of the relinquished child, the agency to which the child has been relinquished is the only one that can consent. Batton v. Massar,

                            that he was unaware of the whereabouts of the natural father, the inherent seriousness of such allegations require an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the due process requirements in the adoption proceedings were met.

                        Agency alone can consent after relinquishment. If there has been a relinquishment, then in proceedings for the adoption of the relinquished child, the agency to which the child has been relinquished is the only one that can consent. Batton v. Massar,

                        child's emotional ties to and interaction with the parties; the child's adjustment to the living situation; the child's age; and the mental and physical health of the parties, and where trial court's factual determinations concerning
                        these factors are supported by the evidence, they will not be disturbed. In re Petition of J.D.K., 37 P.3d 541 (Colo. App. 2001).

                            Purpose of section. The legislative intent is to make the law affecting adopted children in respect to equality of inheritance and parental duties in pari materia with that affecting natural children. Quintrall v. Goldsmith, 134

         Colo. 410

                            The general assembly intended to give an adopted child the legal status of a lineal descendant of the adopting parent or parents, and a child by adoption has the same legal status as a natural child. People ex rel. Dunbar v. White, 144

                            Section liberally construed. While courts were formerly inclined to regard adoption statutes as in derogation of the common law and therefore to be strictly construed, the humanitarian purposes of such statutes came to be recognized, and courts afford
                            them a more liberal construction. Wright v. Wysowatcky, 147

                            Definition of adoption. Adoption has been defined as the act by which relations of paternity and affiliation are recognized as legally existing between persons not so related by nature. Graham v. Francis, 83
                            <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 346

                        <p>
                            Adoption, in legal contemplation, is an act by which the parties thereto establish the relationship of parent and child between persons not so related by nature, and which, in many respects, severs the natural relations existing between the child and
                            its parents, although in a narrower sense it is restricted to the act of the person taking the child. Johnson v. Black, 137

                        <p>
                            Change of custody follows from valid adoption decree. One of the legal effects of an adoption is to divest the natural parents of their custodial rights and to grant such rights to the adoptive parents. This change of custody follows as a natural consequence
                            of a valid adoption decree. Johnson v. Black, 137

                            The adoption statute deprives the natural parents of their rights and obligations to their natural children after adoption. People v. Estate of Murphy, 29

                            Where termination of father's parental rights was based on mother's fraudulent failure to disclose his identity, the father was denied his constitutional due process rights. Therefore, the adoption decrees that were made assuming that both mother's and
                            father's parental rights had been properly terminated were void. Accordingly, the adoptive parents could not be considered to have the full liberty interest in the children that they would have if the adoption decrees were
                            valid. M.C. v. Adoption Choices of

                            General rule as reflected in this section is that an adoption decree terminates the parental rights and duties of child's natural parents and grants those rights and duties to adoptive parents. Singular exception to general rule as set forth in section
                            applies only in cases when adopting parent is married to natural parent. Thus, express statements of limitation must be read to exclude from adoption statute's reach all other possible exceptions not listed. Adoption of T.K.J.,

                            A stepparent adoption proceeding, like all other adoption proceedings, is concluded by a final decree of adoption. It is only when the final decree is entered that a natural parent is divested of all rights and obligations with respect to the child. People

                            After adoption the adopted child becomes the heir of his adoptive parents as though born to them in lawful wedlock, and his natural parents are cut off and neither they nor their lineage may inherit from the adopted child. As to his adoptive parents,
                            the child becomes subject to all rights and obligations of a child born in lawful wedlock. The relation thus established can be nothing less than that of parent and child. To say that such status is less or different from the
                            parent and child relationship would do violence to the clear legislative intent to create unity in the family. Wright v. Wysowatcky, 147

                            Legally adopted children are entitled to inherit as fully as children of the foster parents begotten in lawful wedlock. Quintrall v. Goldsmith, 134

                            It does not affect the power of the adoptive parent to dispose of his property by will, but the adoptive parent may deprive himself of the power thus to dispose of his property by a contract binding him to give the adopted child a certain share of his
                            property. In re Schmidt's Will, 85

                            A testator cannot by will disinherit an adopted child contrary to the specific prohibition of the decree of adoption. Neville v. Bracher, 94

                        <p>
                            An agreement not to disinherit is supported by the consideration of the acquirement by the adoptive parents of the child's love and affection, her filial obligations to them, a change in domestic relationship, the consent of the surviving natural parent
                            to forever relinquish his paternal rights, and the child's forfeiture of her rights which she enjoyed before the adoption proceedings. In re Schmidt's Will, 85

                            The right of inheritance conferred by statute is a reciprocal one, because it depends upon a relation that is created by the adoption under our statute. The adopted child inherits from the adoptive parent. The relation of parent and child having been
                            thus created, the right of the adoptive parent to inherit is the same as was or would have been that of the natural parent. Wright v. Wysowatcky, 147

                            Adoption decree which incorporated statutory language similar to language in this section terminated only the adopted child's obligations to her natural father but not her right to inherit from him; therefore, the child was the heir of her intestate natural
                            father regardless of the validity of her adoption. Matter of Estate of Bomareto, 757 P.2d 1135 (Colo. App. 1988).

                        <p>
                            A twice adopted child cannot inherit from his first adoptive parents unless such parents have died prior to the second adoption or unless he is readopted by his own natural parents where there is a second adoption by strangers. A child cannot logically
                            be the adopted child of more than one set of adoptive parents at a time. Quintrall v. Goldsmith, 134

                        Purpose of section. This section serves the beneficial purpose of curing technical defects which do not affect the basic rights of the parties and guaranteeing to adopting parents the undisturbed relationship with the child, which was one of its legislative
                        intents. White v. Davis, 163
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 122
       </cite> , 428 P.2d 909 (1967).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parties assuming the responsibilities of adoptive parents are entitled to assurance that upon adopting a child they are not also adopting a law suit. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 103
       </cite> , 355 P.2d 317 (1960).

                    <p>
                        Sufficiency of notice. Where a father was serving in the Navy and had notice of a dependency proceeding, his right to contest adoption decrees is barred by this section which limits the right to challenge a valid decree to two years after entry. Olsen
                        v. Davidson, 142
                        <cite class="co_code">

                    <p>
                        Although the record reveals service by publication, where the adequacy or sufficiency of such notice was strongly challenged by motion to vacate which alleged that in support of an order authorizing service by publication the procurer of the order made
                        a false representation that he was unaware of the whereabouts of the natural father, it was a proper matter for evidentiary hearing by the lower court to determine whether the due process requirements in the adoption proceedings
                        were met. White v. Davis, 163
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 122

                        In termination of parental rights case, omission of the process server's verified signature is insufficient to cause prejudice to father's case where father acknowledged he received the notices and petitions. Allowing an amendment to cure the defect serves
                        the best interests of the children. In re Petition of Taylor, 134 P.3d 579 (Colo. App. 2006).

                        Validity of consent. Where the record is devoid of any evidence of fraud, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, or misconduct on the part of the adopting parents or their attorney, and there is nothing to indicate that the mother was lacking in
                        understanding as to the consequences of her consent to the adoption of her children, a finding by the trial court that at the time of signing the consent the mother did not realize the seriousness and finality of her act was insufficient
                        to set aside the decrees of adoption. Batton v. Massar, 149
                        <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 404

                    <p>
                        No inherent right exists to rescind an adoption. When there is no provision made for the annulment of a valid decree of adoption, the right does not exist. In re S.D., 251 P.3d 1188 (Colo. App. 2010).

                        Plaintiff who sought to rescind adoption after 35 years failed to bring an action to set aside the adoption within a reasonable time, barring the court from finding the adoption to be legally void. In re S.D., 251 P.3d 1188 (Colo. App. 2010).

                        or siblings as outlined in section 19-5-305 and that such a right must coexist with the right of such parties to privacy and confidentiality. The general assembly also finds that an adult adoptee, his biological or adoptive parent,
                        or his biological sibling may desire to obtain information about each other at different points in time. Furthermore, the general assembly finds that confidentiality from the general public is essential to the adoption process

                                            had stated a preference authorizing or not authorizing the release of the original birth certificate to eligible parties. If both birth parents have filed a contact preference form executed prior to January

                                The general assembly takes note that the law in Colorado regarding access to adoption records has treated persons differently depending upon the law in effect upon the date of the adoption of the adoptee and that the statutory scheme has been confusing,
                                complicated, and ambiguous. By repealing and reenacting provisions of this section to remove those varying time periods and varying levels of access or nonaccess to adoption records by an adult adoptee or by a birth parent,
                                it is the intent of the general assembly that access to adoption records no longer be dependent upon the law in effect on the date of the finalization of adoption. The general assembly declares that the purpose of the revision
                                of this subsection (2) is to make the access to adoption records by members of the adoption triad more uniform as outlined in this subsection (2). The general assembly further declares that it is the intent of the general
                                assembly to not abrogate, limit, or change the holding in or affect any rights created under In re J.N.H., 209 P.3d 1221 (Colo. App. 2009) with respect to access by an adult adoptee to the names of his or her birth parents
                                and to all court records and papers regarding the adoption of the adult adoptee. The general assembly further declares that in construing this section, the courts should liberally construe this section in favor of releasing
                                the records.

                        There is no ambiguity in the wording of former articles 6 and 7 (new articles 4 and 6) of the Colorado Children's Code. It is quite clear that paternity and support issues are to be determined under article 6 and article 7 is to be used only for the determination
                        of support where paternity is not in dispute. It was error for the court to have conducted a paternity proceeding under the petition for support proceedings. People in Interest of L.B., 29 Colo. App. 101, 482 P.2d 1010 (1970),

                        Determination of paternity precedes support obligation. The provision for support proceedings presupposes that paternity has been established either by a paternity proceeding or by acknowledgment of paternity by the father in writing or by furnishing

                        Article 4 of this title provides the procedures by which a paternity determination is to be made when paternity is disputed. In the absence of a paternity determination, no child support order can be made against a putative father pursuant to this article
                        unless paternity is uncontested. This is so because, before any support order can be entered under this article, the court must find that the person from whom support is sought is a parent or other person legally obligated to support
                        the child. People in Interest of R.T.L., 780 P.2d 508 (Colo. 1989).

                        Limitations bar to paternity actions did not violate equal protection. A mother could bring actions to establish paternity for purposes of support only under article 6 of the Colorado Children's Code, as it existed prior to its 1977 repeal and reenactment,
                        providing for paternity proceedings, and if she failed to bring them before the child reaches the age of five years, the actions were thereafter barred, and such a result did not violate the equal protection guaranty of the constitution.

                        Article 4 of this title provides the procedures by which a paternity determination is to be made when paternity is disputed. In the absence of a paternity determination, no child support order can be made against a putative father pursuant to this article

                        the child. People in Interest of R.T.L., 780 P.2d 508 (Colo. 1989).

                        presumption known to law. It is not, however, conclusive and can only be overcome by clear and convincing proof that the husband is either impotent or had no access to the wife at any time when, according to the course of nature,
                        conception could have occurred. People in interest of A.M.D. v. R.C.D., 29

                        Denver department of social services not stranger to proceedings. Where the Denver department of social services was before the juvenile court when it was awarded and accepted custody of a minor and it initially recommended placement of the child, its
                        contention that it was in effect a stranger to the proceedings, being neither served with a summons nor given a hearing, is totally without support. City &amp; County of Denver v. Brockhurst Boys Ranch, Inc., 195

                        of kin, treatment providers, and others, to seek opportunities to foster those sibling relationships to promote continuity and help to sustain family relationships.

                                Available research shows that emancipating youth benefit from extended foster care services and supports until age twenty-one, and community-based supports through early adulthood, but for the benefits of such services and supports to last, youth in foster
                                care need developmentally appropriate services, including freedom to test their independence and to make mistakes with proportional consequences and a reasonable safety net.

                        supports in the community, the state can better meet the needs of those youth who are making the transition from foster care to successful adulthood.

                        A voluntary services agreement entered into pursuant to this part 3 is a binding standardized agreement, written in a client-driven and developmentally appropriate manner, between the county department and a participating youth. The agreement specifies
                        the terms of the youth's participation in the transition program, including, at a minimum:
