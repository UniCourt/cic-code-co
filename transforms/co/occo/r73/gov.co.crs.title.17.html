       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the construction, expansion, renovation, or improvement of state-built and operated department of corrections facilities is a matter of statewide and not local concern. Therefore, the department, in authorizing and financing the construction, expansion, renovation, or improvement of its facilities, is exempt from regional, county, and local planning requirements, including those specified in section  30-28-110, C.R.S., and those authorized by section  29-20-104, C.R.S.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, whenever the department plans to locate a new corrections facility or expand an existing corrections facility, the department shall submit facility program plans to the governing body of the county or municipality in which the facility is proposed to be located or expanded and afford the governing body an opportunity for advisory review of such plans.

Accordingly, this section is intended to apply to causes of action pending on or filed on or after July 1, 1996.

       Based upon available appropriations and based upon an annual review by the general assembly, the department is authorized to permanently place state inmates classified as medium custody and below in private contract prisons. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, the department may not place state inmates classified higher than medium custody in private contract prisons or in private prison facilities located outside the state of Colorado. This section does not prevent a private contract prison from incarcerating an inmate who has been reclassified to a higher custody designation as a result of an offense committed within the private contract prison. However, it is the intent of the general assembly that the department move any inmate of a higher custody designation out of the private contract prison as soon as space is available at a state-operated correctional facility.

       17-1-205. Contract termination - control of a correctional facility by the department.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A contractor shall submit a detailed plan for the department to assume temporary responsibility for a private contract prison when the contract between the state and the contractor terminates. The state, through the executive director, may terminate the contract for cause, including but not limited to failure to obtain or maintain facility accreditation, after written notice of material deficiencies and after sixty workdays have been provided to the contractor to correct the material deficiencies. If any event occurs involving the noncompliance with or violation of contract terms and presents a serious threat to the safety, health, or security of the inmates, employees, or the public, the department may temporarily assume responsibility for the private contract prison. In addition, a contractor shall submit a plan for the temporary assumption of operations and purchase of a private contract prison by the department in the event of bankruptcy or the financial insolvency of the contractor. The contractor shall provide an emergency plan to address inmate disturbances, employee work stoppages, strikes, or other serious events. The plan shall comply with applicable national correctional standards. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the state to assume the responsibility for the operation of private contract prisons and costs associated with contractual termination described in this section. If the state chooses, it may assume responsibility upon approval by the general assembly through the enactment of legislation.

         Due process requires fairness in revocation hearings.
        </b>
        Parolees in parole revocation hearings are not entitled to the specifics of due process available to an accused in the first instance, but this in no way negates their right to enjoy due process as that mandate reflects the right of all persons to inherent fairness in all compulsive processes. Martinez v. Patterson, 429 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 934, 91 S. Ct. 1528, 28 L. Ed. 2d 868 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the parolee's liberty cannot be terminated without reason, it does not follow that he is entitled to all of the federal constitutional procedures and safeguards guaranteed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. Thus, he is not entitled to a speedy public trial pursuant to the sixth amendment, but is entitled to a fair hearing for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not he has violated his parole. Hutchison v. Patterson, 267 F. Supp. 433 (D.

       <p>
        The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution does not generate rights to confrontation, to cross-examination, or to compulsory process at parole revocation hearings. Due process does not comprehend the dual rights to witnesses under oath and evidence in conditional release hearings. Firkins v. Colo., 434 F.2d 1232 (10th Cir. 1970).

        The right of a prisoner to be heard at a revocation hearing is inviolative; so, too, is the right to know and be specifically informed of the charges and the nature of the evidence against him; and, finally, the right to be free from pure caprice on the part of the discretionary authority before whom the proceedings occur. The right to gather and file written statements before the board is an empty right unless parole violators are given notice of the charges prior to their hearing before the parole board. Martinez v.

An indigent defendant suffers no substantial disadvantage because an attorney is not made available to him to write letters to the state parole board.

       <p>

         Tolling of expiration of parole upon filing of a parole violation complaint by parole officer

        applies to all offenders, including those who committed crimes before the statute was enacted. Duran v. Price, 868 P.2d 375 (Colo. 1994).

         The plain meaning of subsection (7) provides that, upon finding good cause by the parole board, a parole revocation hearing can be delayed
        </b>
        beyond 30 days after the parolee's arrest and a parolee can be held in custody for a reasonable time pending a revocation hearing. The section does not convey automatic good cause to delay a parole hearing for pending resolution of an underlying criminal case, nor does the statute require a parolee to be released from custody after 30 days.

        it is a reasonable search and seizure in light of an inmate's diminished privacy rights; the minimal intrusion of saliva and blood tests; and the legitimate government interest in the investigation and prosecution of unsolved and future criminal acts by the use of DNA in a manner not significantly different from the use of fingerprints.

       The general assembly hereby finds that persons who are convicted of offenses in the state which result in such persons being confined to a local jail or a correctional facility, being sentenced to home detention, being placed on probation by the sentencing court, or being placed on parole by the state board of parole should be required, where appropriate, to reimburse the state or a county or a city and county for the cost of care incurred as a result of such sentence. The general assembly further finds that a convicted person's financial circumstances may be fraudulently misrepresented to the sentencing court or that such circumstances may change after sentencing so that a person who is unable to pay the cost of care at sentencing may be or become able to contribute to the cost of care at a later date.

        Searches of prison visitors outside of the correctional facility on less than probable cause are unlawful.

       The clear language of this section, confining searches of prison visitors to the correctional facility, acknowledges the justification for allowing such searches on less than probable cause, which is the need to prevent the introduction of contraband and weapons into the prison rather than to detect evidence of a crime.

        Guard's authority does not include engaging in undercover activities.

       A penitentiary guard, accused of aiding an escape, whose theory of the case is that he was attempting to apprehend an escaped criminal by using undercover techniques, is not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of execution of public duty when his authority to make an arrest is limited to penitentiary grounds and there is no evidence he had any authorization to engage in undercover activities.

       Any person convicted of a crime and confined in any state correctional facility listed in section  17-1-104.3 is not entitled to any privileges that may be made available by the department. If any such person is required by the department to perform any available labor, participate in any available educational program or work program, undergo any available counseling, or any one or a combination of the foregoing and such person does not perform the labor, participate in the program, undergo the counseling, or do any one or a combination of the foregoing as required by the department, the department shall deny specified privileges to such person. The privileges that the department shall deny to such person include, but are not limited to, television, radios, entertainment systems, and access to snacks. If the department denies television privileges, it may allow a person to watch television for educational purposes, including public television broadcasts transmitted to or available to the facility. A person who is physically unable to perform labor, participate in an educational program or work program, or undergo counseling may be allowed the privileges specified in this subsection (1).

       In making the distinction between the method of recovering the costs of confining and maintaining convicted criminals and of caring for and treating the criminally insane, the legislative difference in class is not unreasonable. The general assembly has given recognition to the fact that the criminally insane persons are ill and that many usually cannot be put to profitable work. State v. Estate of Burnell, 165

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the duty of all the officers and other citizens of the state, by every means in their power, to suppress any insurrection among the inmates sentenced to any correctional facilities under the supervision of the executive director and to prevent the escape or rescue of any such inmate therefrom, or from any other legal confinement, or from any person in whose legal custody such inmate may be. If, in so doing or in arresting any inmate who may have escaped, such officer or other person wounds or kills such inmate or other person aiding or assisting such inmate, such officer or other person shall be justified and held guiltless; but such officer or other person shall not be excused for using greater force than the emergency of the case demands.

        The U.S. supreme court's decision in Miller v. Alabama renders a mandatory life without the possibility of parole sentence for juveniles convicted between 1990 and 2006 unconstitutional.
       </b>
       For cases on direct appeal, the remedy for those sentenced to mandatory life without parole is a remand to determine through an individual consideration of the defendant's youth and attendant circumstances whether a sentence of life without parole is appropriate. If the sentencing court on remand determines that life without parole is not warranted, then the appropriate sentence, absent legislative action, is life in prison with the possibility of parole after forty years.

       Ten days prior to the date on which any inmate confined in a correctional facility is entitled to be discharged or to be paroled from said correctional facility, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall give such inmate a ticket of leave therefrom, which shall entitle the inmate to depart from said correctional facility. The executive director or the executive director's designee shall at the same time furnish such inmate with suitable clothing and may furnish transportation, at the expense of the state, from the place at which said correctional facility is located to the place of the inmate's residence in Colorado, or any other place in Colorado. The executive director or the executive director's designee shall also furnish to any inmate being discharged, other than a parolee, one hundred dollars.

        An inmate does not have a vested right in earned time,

        The creation and distribution of credits to be applied against an inmate's sentence are matters committed to the authority of the legislature;

       trial court orders do not prevail over the letter and intent of statutory provisions adopted by the general assembly. Renneke v. Kautzky, 782 P.2d 343 (Colo. 1989).

       <b>
        For crimes committed on or after July 1, 1985, deductions for earned time are within discretionary authority of the department of corrections.
       </b>
       Since the department of corrections may withhold, withdraw, or restore earned time deductions, an inmate's maximum control date, as initially calculated by the department of corrections, is not necessarily the date upon which he is entitled to unconditional release. Renneke v. Kautzky, 782 P.2d 343 (Colo. 1989).

        Granting of earned time credit for educational programs under subsection (1.5) lies with the discretion of the department.

If an application for parole is refused by the state board of parole, the state board shall reconsider within one year thereafter the granting of parole to such person and shall continue the reconsideration each year thereafter until such person is granted parole or until such person is discharged pursuant to law; except that, if the person applying for parole was convicted of any class 3 sexual offense described in part 4 of article 3 of title 18, C.R.S., a habitual criminal offense as defined in section  18-1.3-801 (2.5), C.R.S., or of any offense subject to the requirements of section  18-1.3-904, C.R.S., the board need only reconsider granting parole to such person once every three years, until the board grants such person parole or until such person is discharged pursuant to law, or if the person applying for parole was convicted of a class 1 or class 2 felony that constitutes a crime of violence, as defined in section  18-1.3-406, C.R.S., the board need only reconsider granting parole to such person once every five years, until the board grants such person parole or until such person is discharged pursuant to law.

The conditions for parole for any such offender under this subsection (7) shall be established pursuant to section  17-22.5-404 by the state board of parole prior to such offender's release from incarceration. Upon a determination that the conditions of parole have been violated in a parole revocation proceeding, the state board of parole shall continue the parole in effect, modify the conditions of parole if circumstances then shown to exist require such modifications, which circumstances shall be set forth in writing, or revoke the parole and order the return of the offender to a place of confinement designated by the executive director for a period of not more than five years. In computing the period of reincarceration for an offender other than an offender sentenced for a nonviolent felony offense, as defined in section  17-22.5-405 (5), the time between the offender's release on parole and return to custody in Colorado for revocation of such parole shall not be considered to be any part of the term of the sentence.

      The general assembly hereby declares that if any inmate does not demonstrate positive behavior during incarceration, such inmate should be required to serve out the full sentence imposed upon such inmate. If any inmate does demonstrate positive behavior during incarceration, such inmate should be considered for release from incarceration prior to the end of the full sentence imposed upon him. Therefore, the general assembly, in enacting this part 4, intends to provide standards whereby any inmate can earn a reduction of incarceration time and to provide incentives for inmates to demonstrate positive behavior during incarceration.

        Mandamus relief under C.R.C.P. 106 is available to challenge the parole board's actions if it has failed to exercise its statutory duties.
       </b>
       Although plaintiff did not expressly seek mandamus relief pursuant to C.R.C.P. 106, the gravamen of his complaint was that the parole board's failure to consider any events or circumstances prior to plaintiff's incarceration was in direct violation of statutory guidelines for parole. Under these circumstances, the trial court had jurisdiction to address the merits of the complaint. Fraser v.

        Confinement of insane persons is constitutional.
       </b>
       The state as parens patriae has general power and is under the general duty of caring for insane persons. The prerogative is a segment of police power. In the exercise of such power, insane persons may be restrained and confined both for the welfare of themselves and for the protection of the public, and if the exactions of due process are met, such restraint and confinement do not violate any constitutional right of the individual. Pigg v. Patterson, 370 F.2d 101 (10th Cir. 1966).

      <p>
       <b>
        Whether in a federal or state penal system, the disposition of those adjudicated criminally irresponsible is a matter of administrative determination
       </b>
       which the federal courts should not undertake to supervise. Sound and practical reasons readily occur in support of the state's designation of the penitentiary as the appropriate place of confinement for those criminally insane who demonstrate dangerous or violent tendencies. One who has been adjudicated in a court of law to be criminally irresponsible, and duly committed thereupon, has no vested right to any particular place of institutionalization. Pigg v. Patterson, 370 F.2d 101 (10th Cir. 1966).

        The procedures for transfer among the Colorado correctional institutions are valid,

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, to the extent possible, all able-bodied offenders should be employed and that the means now provided for the employment of offenders are inadequate to allow a forty-hour-week work assignment for all able-bodied offenders and for correctional industries programs to be operated on a financially profitable basis. Therefore, it is the intent of the general assembly in this article to:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t17-facilities-ar24-s17-24-102ol11a">
         Create a division of correctional industries which is profit-oriented, which generates revenue for its operations and capital investment, which partly reimburses the general fund for the expense of correctional services, and which assumes responsibility for training offenders in general work habits, work skills, and specific training skills that increase their employment prospects when released;
        </li>
        <li id="t17-facilities-ar24-s17-24-102ol11b">
         Develop, to the extent possible, industries that provide forty hours of work activity each week for all able-bodied offenders;
        </li>
        <li id="t17-facilities-ar24-s17-24-102ol11c">
         Provide an environment for the operation of correctional industries that closely resembles the environment for the business operations of a private corporate entity;
        </li>
        <li id="t17-facilities-ar24-s17-24-102ol11d">
         Make the division of correctional industries responsible for and accountable to the general assembly and to the governor for correctional industries programs in this state.

In addition, the county jail may assess a reasonable medical treatment charge for each visit by a person in custody to an institutional or noninstitutional physician, dentist, or optometrist; except that a medical treatment charge shall not be assessed for any visit required by the county jail during the intake process or an annual physical examination required by the county jail. In no case shall a person's inability to pay be the basis for not providing medical treatment equivalent to the community standard of care.

      When there is no sufficient jail in any county wherein any criminal offense has been committed, any county or district judge, upon application of the sheriff, may order any person charged with any criminal offense and ordered to be committed to jail to be sent to the jail of the county nearest having a sufficient jail. The sheriff of such nearest county, on exhibit of the order of such judge, shall receive and keep in safe custody in the jail of his county the person ordered to be so committed. Such sheriff, upon the order of the district court thereof, shall redeliver such person when demanded, and all the expenses of keeping such person shall be paid by the county from which such person was sent. The board of county commissioners of the county from which any prisoner is sent, at the next regular meeting after receiving the bill for the expenses of such maintenance, safekeeping, and custody, shall audit and allow the claim and pay the same to the treasurer of the county in which such jail is situated for the use of such county.

     <p>
      In case of escape of any person lawfully committed to any jail of any county in this state, it is the duty of the sheriff of the county where such jail is situated to pursue and recapture such escaped person at the expense of the office of such sheriff. In case of any escape without any fault or negligence on the part of the keeper of the jail or the guards under such keeper's command, the board of county commissioners of the county where such jail is situated may audit and allow to the office of the sheriff the necessary expenses incurred in such recapture.

      <p>
       The general assembly hereby declares that it is the purpose of this article to establish and maintain community corrections programs which provide the courts, the department of corrections, and the state board of parole with more flexibility and a broader range of correctional options for offenders under the jurisdiction of such entities. It is the further purpose of this article to increase public safety and promote community-based correctional programming through collaboration between the state of Colorado and local units of government. It is also the purpose of this article to give local units of government the authority to designate the programs, boards, and networks established under this article to address local criminal justice needs with resources other than those appropriated pursuant to this article.

Home detention and ISP are mutually exclusive, therefore once the court determines whether the defendant was in home detention or on ISP there is no conflict. People v. Smith, 77 P.3d 751 (Colo.

        Defendant is required to file motion for reduction of sentence within 120 days after the date of successful completion of regimented inmate training program.
       </b>
       This is because Crim. P. 35(b) provides a 120-day time limitation for the filing of a motion for reduction of sentence, and this section requires that a motion to reduce sentence must be brought pursuant to Crim. P. 35(b). People v. Campbell, 75 P.3d 1151 (Colo. App. 2003).

        This section expressly incorporates the provisions of Crim. P. 35(b) as the framework for considering sentence reduction
       </b>
       for any participant in the regimented inmate training program. Crim. P. 35(b) provides that the trial court "may, after considering the motion and supporting documents, if any, deny the motion without a hearing." Therefore, the plain language of the rule belies the claim that a hearing is required on a Crim. P. 35(b) motion. People v. Morales-Uresti, 934 P.2d 856 (Colo.

        Resentencing of a successful regimented inmate training program participant is governed by the same statutory limits applicable to Crim. P. 35(b) resentencing.
       </b>
       A Crim. P. 35(b) motion, and therefore a motion for reduction of sentence under this section, gives the court discretion to resentence the defendant to a lesser term within the statutory limits, but not to lower a mandatory minimum sentence imposed by law for a specific crime. People v. Smith, 971 P.2d 1056 (Colo. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons convicted of child abuse resulting in death are eligible for sentence modification upon successful completion of the regimented inmate training program, but the sentencing court's discretion is limited by the relevant mandatory sentencing limits. People v. Smith, 971 P.2d 1056 (Colo. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        An offender who completes the boot camp program must be referred to the sentencing court after completing the program to reconsider sentencing, however, that does not mean the judge who imposed the sentence must consider the request to reduce the defendant's sentence.
       </b>
       The request must merely be considered by a district court judge with the power to rule on such a motion. People v. Banuelos-Landa, 109 P.3d 1039 (Colo. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not allow a court to reduce a sentence to less than the statutory minimum sentence for the crime committed.
       </b>
       Thus the sentence of a person serving a mandatory minimum sentence for child abuse resulting in death could not be reduced pursuant to this section. People v. Smith, 971 P.2d 1056 (Colo. 1999).
      </p>

       <b>
        District attorney not permitted to withdraw from plea agreement when sentence reduced pursuant to this section.
       </b>
       Because the plea agreement did not foreclose the future possibility of a reduction in sentence, the court-ordered sentence reduction could not amount to a substantial and material breach of the agreement between the parties. Keller v. People, 29 P.3d 290 (Colo. 2000).

        For purposes of escape, there is no conflict between the home detention statute and the intensive supervision program (ISP) statute.
       </b>
       In an escape case, the court must make a factual determination whether a defendant was placed in home detention or ISP based on the different elements of home detention and ISP. Home detention and ISP are mutually exclusive, therefore once the court determines whether the defendant was in home detention or on ISP there is no conflict. People v. Smith, 77 P.3d 751 (Colo. App. 2003); People v. Sa'ra, 117 P.3d 51 (Colo. App. 2004).

The volunteers shall complete the department's volunteer and facility-specific training programs and complete high-risk victim-offender training and victim advocacy training. The department shall not compensate or reimburse a volunteer or victim for any expenses nor otherwise incur any additional expenses to establish or operate the victim-offender conferences pilot program. If a pilot program is available, and subsequent to the victim's or the victim representative's request, the department shall arrange such a conference only after determining that the conference would be safe and only if the offender agrees to participate. The purposes of the conference shall be to enable the victim to meet the offender, to obtain answers to questions only the offender can answer, to assist the victim in healing from the impact of the crime, and to promote a sense of remorse and acceptance of responsibility by the offender that may contribute to his or her rehabilitation.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the people of this state would benefit from a program to reclaim and maintain the land and resources of public entities within this state; that the executive director has custody over inmates, both male and female, who could be utilized as a labor force in such a program; that such a program would reinforce the rehabilitation of such inmates, provide work skills, and instill a work ethic in the inmates, thereby facilitating their readjustment to society; and that work assignments involving physical labor will assist the executive director and the wardens in the management of correctional facilities under their supervision. To these ends, it is the purpose of this article to create within the department physical labor work programs, including an intensive labor work program for all inmates sentenced to the department, including repeat offenders and parole violators as well as those inmates who demonstrate behavior inconsistent with the rules of the department or any of its facilities, which utilize the physical labor of inmates. The executive director or the executive director's designee may appoint facility wardens, responsible for the administration of correctional facilities, to perform the duties and functions set forth in this article.

Such intensive labor work program shall be operated on an incentive basis so that an offender assigned to the intensive labor work program who demonstrates that he or she is willing to modify his or her behavioral patterns, to cooperate in his or her rehabilitation, and to learn both a work ethic and a job skill becomes eligible for reassignment from the intensive labor work program.

Eligibility for reassignment from the intensive labor work program to such educational or vocational work programs as are consistent with the diagnosis and evaluation conducted pursuant to article 40 of this title will be determined by departmental classification action after reviewing the offender's willingness to modify behavioral patterns, to commit to cooperating in rehabilitation, and to learn both a work ethic and a job skill.

      The general assembly hereby finds it necessary to provide for and encourage the implementation of programs within the state's correctional facilities, the probation division of the judicial department, the parole division within the department of corrections, the division of youth services within the department of human services, and the department of public safety that enable volunteers to effectively assist with the rehabilitation and transition of adult and juvenile offenders. The general assembly encourages the maximum use of volunteers to complement the regular staffs of such adult corrections, parole, probation, and juvenile services divisions and encourages volunteers to participate in existing programs for adult and juvenile offenders in those divisions. The general assembly finds that such volunteers should be allowed, where practical and within the safety and security requirements of the applicable institution or program, to meet with and freely communicate with offenders to assist with the rehabilitation and transition of such offenders, in order to establish support groups and systems outside of the correctional facility.

        Thus, in sentencing an offender directly to the department of corrections, a court is not required to include information concerning good time credit on the mittimus.

        The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that American Indian religions and religious beliefs predate the creation of the United States constitution; however, understanding of and respect for American Indian religious practices is not widespread among non-indigenous persons. The general assembly further finds that serious problems in the practice of religious freedom persist for the American Indian and particularly for American Indians who are incarcerated. Therefore, in order to protect this most basic freedom for American Indians who are incarcerated, traditional religious and ceremonial practices of American Indians should be permitted in correctional facilities to the extent that such practices do not impinge on the reasonable security interests of the correctional facilities to which such Indians are confined.

        American Indians who are confined to a correctional facility as defined in section  17-1-102 and who practice an American Indian religion as defined in subsection (5) of this section shall have access on a regular basis to the following:
