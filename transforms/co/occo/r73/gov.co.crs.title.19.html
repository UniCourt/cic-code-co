             (1.6) The general assembly recognizes the numerous studies establishing that children undergo a critical bonding and attachment process prior to the time they reach six years of age. Such studies further disclose that a child who has not bonded with a primary adult during this critical stage will suffer significant emotional damage which frequently leads to chronic psychological problems and antisocial behavior when the child reaches adolescence and adulthood. Accordingly, the general assembly finds and declares that it is appropriate to provide for an expedited placement procedure to ensure that children under the age of six years who have been removed from their homes are placed in permanent homes as expeditiously as possible.

        The parent-child relationship finds protection in both the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment, and parents have a fundamental interest in maintaining this legal relationship with their natural children. Termination of the parent-child relationship divests the parent and the child of all legal rights and obligations with respect to each other. For this reason, the power of the state to sever parental ties should be exercised with extreme caution. People in Interest of E.A., 638 P.2d 278 (Colo. 1981).

The court shall use the standardized forms developed by the judicial department pursuant to section  13-1-136 and shall follow the standards and procedures for the issuance of civil protection orders set forth in article 14 of title 13, including but not limited to personal service upon the restrained person. Once issued, the clerk of the issuing court shall enter the civil protection order into the computerized central registry of protection orders created pursuant to section  18-6-803.7. If the person who is the subject of the civil protection order has not been personally served pursuant to section  13-14-107 (3), a peace officer responding to a call for assistance shall serve a copy of the civil protection order on the person who is subject to the order. If the civil protection order is made permanent pursuant to the provisions of section  13-14-106, the civil protection order remains in effect upon termination of the juvenile court action. The clerk of the court issuing the order shall file a certified copy of the permanent civil protection order into an existing case in the district court, if applicable, or with the county court in the county where the protected party resides. Civil protection orders issued by the district or the juvenile court pursuant to article 14 of title 13 have the same force and effect as protection orders issued pursuant to article 14 of title 13 by a court with concurrent jurisdiction.

        A district court's jurisdiction to dispose of the custody of a child as between the parties to a divorce proceeding and as ancillary to that proceeding, is suspended by the institution of and during the pendency of a direct proceeding in dependency by the state in the interest of the child in a county court under this section.

        The jurisdiction of a divorce court is exercised as between a husband and wife; that of a juvenile court in dependency proceedings, as between the state in the interest of the child, and the parents of the child. The two courts may have simultaneous, though not concurrent, jurisdiction concerning the custody of a child. But where both courts make orders concerning such custody, the operation of the order of the divorce court is suspended during the period, and only during the period, that the order of the juvenile court remains in force.

A copy of such findings shall be sent to the chief justice of the Colorado supreme court, who shall report annually to the joint budget committee and the health and human services committees of the house of representatives and senate of the general assembly, or any successor committees, on such orders. If the court commits the child to the department of human services, it shall not make a specific placement, nor shall the provisions of this paragraph (f) relating to specific findings of fact be applicable. If the court makes a finding that continued placement is not necessary and is not in the best interest of the child, the family, and the community, the court shall dismiss the petition for review of need for placement and shall order that the child be returned home. The court may require a continued hearing of the petition for review of need for placement for a period not to exceed fourteen days if it finds that the materials submitted are insufficient to make a finding as provided in this paragraph (f).

       The lack of notice to guardians of the pendency of the petition to dismiss the guardianship was a denial of due process sufficient to deprive the juvenile court of jurisdiction and render its order of dismissal void, and the full hearing accorded guardians in habeas corpus proceedings did not cure the infirmity which resulted from the failure of the juvenile court to give the guardians notice of the petition.

           The general assembly hereby finds that the number of children in out-of-home placement has increased significantly. The general assembly further finds that the facility in which a child is placed out of home is often not located in the same school district as the child's school district of residence. Nevertheless, the general assembly finds that, under the provisions of the "Public School Finance Act of 1994", article 54 of title 22, C.R.S., children in foster home placement are considered residents of the school district in which the foster home is located. Accordingly, the school district in which the child is placed must accommodate the child and provide the child with the necessary educational services that serve the child's best interests while absorbing the costs associated with such services within the constraints of the school district's existing budget. The general assembly finds that in many circumstances it is not possible to meet the best interests of the child in out-of-home placement and the needs of other children enrolled in the school district within the confines of the district's budget.

           The general assembly determines that the number of children in out-of-home placement and the severity of their attendant needs are increasing. The ability to meet the needs of the children in out-of-home placement is frequently restricted by the limited resources available to a school district. Furthermore, the general assembly finds that there is a disproportionately larger number of children in out-of-home placement in some school districts than in others, thereby directly impacting the ability of certain school districts to effectively manage and finance the provision of quality educational services to all students in those districts.

         The general assembly therefore determines that it would serve the best interests of all children enrolled in a school district if the number of children placed in out-of-home placement facilities by county departments of human or social services in each of the various school districts is monitored so that the financial impact on all school districts throughout the state is manageable and equitable and so that the best interests of all children, whether or not in out-of-home placement, can be served.

The amount thus reimbursed to each county must represent the total expenditure by an individual county for foster care and for alternative services provided in conformance with the plan prepared and approved pursuant to subsections (2)(b) and (4) of this section.

       Any grandparent or great-grandparent of a child may, in the manner set forth in this section, seek a court order granting the grandparent or great-grandparent reasonable grandchild or great-grandchild visitation rights when there is or has been a child custody case or a case concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities relating to that child. Because cases arise that do not directly deal with child custody or the allocation of parental responsibilities but nonetheless have an impact on the custody of or parental responsibilities with respect to a child, for the purposes of this section, a "case concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities with respect to a child" includes any of the following, whether or not child custody was or parental responsibilities were specifically an issue:

         That legal custody of or parental responsibilities with respect to the child have been given or allocated to a party other than the child's parent or that the child has been placed outside of and does not reside in the home of the child's parent, excluding any child who has been placed for adoption or whose adoption has been legally finalized; or

The party with legal custody or parental responsibilities as determined by a court pursuant to article 10 of title 14, C.R.S., may file opposing affidavits. If neither party requests a hearing, the court shall enter an order granting grandchild or great-grandchild visitation rights to the petitioning grandparent or great-grandparent only upon a finding that the visitation is in the best interests of the child.

       This section may be construed to embody the protections required by Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000). The court read this section as requiring that the biological parent's decisions concerning grandparent visitation must carry special weight and significance in the adjudication of the grandparent's visitation petition. The burden of proof must be such that the parent need not prove that the grandparent visitation would adversely affect the child. In re C.M., 74 P.3d 342 (Colo. App. 2002); In re R.A., 66 P.3d 146 (Colo. App. 2002).

       The so-called "adoption exclusion" in subsection (1)(b) has been construed to apply only when a child becomes available for adoption because the natural parents' rights have been legally terminated.

       Because the statute requires a grandparent to rebut the presumption that the parent's decision regarding visitation is in the child's best interest, it does not give rise to an absolute right to visitation. Because the statute does not vest a grandparent with an absolute right to visitation and issues concerning grandparent visitation are not inherent in a paternity action, there is no absolute or unconditional right for a grandparent to intervene in a paternity action.

        A grandparent can possess visitation rights.
       </b>
       Although the visitation rights of a grandparent are more limited than those of parents, they are still recognized by Colorado law. A limited right remains a right. Thus, a Colorado state court order of visitation rights vests a maternal grandmother with "parental rights" under the plain language of the federal International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act (IPKCA). Further, a grandparent with joint custody or sole custody as defined by state law also has "parental rights" under the IPKCA. U.S. v. Alahmad, 28 F. Supp. 2d 1273 (D.

         The general assembly declares that information obtained by public agencies in the course of performing their duties and functions under this title is considered public information under the "Colorado Open Records Act", part 2 of article 72 of title 24, C.R.S. The general assembly, however, recognizes that certain information obtained in the course of the implementation of this title is highly sensitive and has an impact on the privacy of children and members of their families. The disclosure of sensitive information carries the risk of stigmatizing children; however, absolute confidentiality of such information may result in duplicated services in some cases, fragmented services in others, and the delivery of ineffective and costly programs and, in some situations, may put other members of the public at risk of harm. In addition, disclosure may result in serving the best interests of the child and may be in the public interest.

         Furthermore, the general assembly specifically finds that schools, school districts, and criminal justice agencies attempting to protect children and the public are often frustrated by their lack of ability to exchange information concerning disruptive children who may have experienced disciplinary actions at school or whose actions outside of a school setting may have resulted in contact with local law enforcement. The general assembly finds that schools, school districts, and criminal justice agencies are often better able to assist such disruptive children and to preserve school safety when they are equipped with knowledge concerning a child's history and experiences. The general assembly, however, recognizes that any such sharing of information among and between schools, school districts, and agencies to promote school safety or otherwise to assist disruptive children mandates an awareness of the responsibility on the part of those schools, school districts, and agencies receiving or providing the information that it be used only for its intended and limited purpose as authorized by law and that the confidential nature of the information be preserved. The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is desirable to authorize and encourage open communication among appropriate agencies, including criminal justice agencies, assessment centers for children, school districts, and schools, in order to assist disruptive children and to maintain safe schools.

         The general assembly further finds that partners in multi-agency assessment centers for children are often frustrated by their lack of ability to exchange information with each other when attempting to serve children and the public.

The general assembly, however, recognizes that any such sharing of information among agencies who are part of a multi-agency assessment center for children mandates an awareness of the responsibility on the part of the agencies receiving or providing the information that it be used only for its intended and limited purpose as authorized by law and that the confidential nature of the information be preserved.

         The general assembly recognizes the importance of children receiving support from all responsible parties and further finds that the state child support enforcement agency and the delegate child support enforcement units have a need to exchange information with other state, federal, and local agencies in order to effectively locate responsible parties; establish paternity and child support, including child support debt pursuant to section  14-14-104, C.R.S.; enforce support orders; disburse collected child support payments; and facilitate the efficient and effective delivery of services under articles 13 and 13.5 of title 26, C.R.S. Therefore, the general assembly recognizes that the state child support enforcement agency and the delegate child support enforcement units need access to the records and databases of the judicial department, the contents of which are otherwise protected under the provisions of this part 3. The general assembly, however, recognizes that any such information sharing mandates an awareness of responsibility on the part of the state child support enforcement agency and the delegate child support enforcement units receiving information that it be used only for its intended purposes as authorized by law and in accordance with the provisions of section  26-13-102.7, C.R.S., and that the confidential nature of the information be preserved.

         The general assembly recognizes the need to make recommendations to the court concerning the many aspects of a child's legal status, including but not limited to existing court orders on placement of the child, legal custody of the child, and orders of protection. Because the population of this state is transitory, and jurisdictional lines for the purpose of court actions are arbitrary, communication of certain information available electronically on a statewide basis may assist state and county agencies, attorneys representing state or county agencies, and attorneys appointed by the court in making recommendations to the court. The general assembly recognizes that any such sharing of information among agencies, attorneys representing agencies, and attorneys appointed by the court mandates an awareness of the responsibility on the part of these agencies, attorneys representing agencies, and attorneys appointed by the court in receiving and providing the information that it be used only for its intended and limited purpose as authorized by law and that the confidential nature of the information be preserved.

           The general assembly further recognizes the need for the command authority of military installations under the United States secretary of defense to receive notice and information regarding any report that is assigned for an assessment by the state department of human services or a county department of known or suspected instances of child abuse or neglect in which the person having care of the child in question is a member of the armed forces or a spouse, or a significant other or family member residing in the home of the member of the armed forces. The general assembly recognizes the need for the state department of human services and county departments to collect information concerning the military affiliation of the individual having custody or control of a child who is the subject of an investigation of child abuse or neglect.
           (f) (I) The general assembly further recognizes the need for the command authority of military installations under the United States secretary of defense to receive notice and information regarding any report that is assigned for an assessment by the state department of human services or a county department of known or suspected instances of child abuse or neglect in which the person having care of the child in question is a member of the armed forces or a spouse, or a significant other or family member residing in the home of the member of the armed forces.

           To further the fulfillment of these needs, the state department of human services and county departments should be able to enter into memorandums of understanding with the command authority of military installations. The memorandums of understanding may establish protocols for the sharing of information related to assessments of known or suspected instances of child abuse or neglect and for collaboration on the oversight of child abuse or neglect investigations involving a member of the armed forces or a spouse, or a significant other or family member residing in the home of the member of the armed forces.

          <li id="t19-ar01-p03-s19-1-302ol11fIV">

        Subsection (2) does not provide equal access to social services records in a criminal case.
       </b>
       People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2)(f) limits defendant's access to items that the trial court, after an in camera review, determines necessary for the resolution of an issue. Therefore, defendant cannot expect automatic disclosure of records within the possession and control of prosecuting attorney. Instead, defendant must request an in camera review, identify the information sought, and explain why disclosure is necessary for resolution of an issue. To achieve the broadest possible disclosure, defendant should explain the relevance and materiality of the information sought. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor has full access to records while investigating a report of known or suspected incident of child abuse or neglect. Subsection (2)(f) does not suspend prosecutor's obligation to disclose information that is materially favorable to defendant. However, that duty to disclose is still subject to the in camera review process in subsection (2)(f). Therefore, if the prosecutor believes a social services record contains information it must disclose, the prosecutor must ask the trial court to conduct an in camera review of the information to determine if disclosure is necessary for the resolution of an issue. If the trial court determines the information is necessary then it is disclosed to the defendant. The prosecutor does not have the right to offer the material into evidence without first obtaining the trial court's approval. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2)(f) places the trial court in the middle of a procedural issue that normally would have been handled by counsel through the automatic disclosure requirements of Crim. P. 16(I)(a)(1). The trial court must review the records to determine whether the records are necessary for the resolution of an issue. Although the determination of whether the records should be disclosed must be made on case-specific circumstances, there are three principles that apply generally. First, under due process considerations, the trial court must disclose any information that is materially favorable to defendant because it is either exculpatory or impeaching. Second, the trial court should disclose inculpatory information when the information would materially assist in preparing the defense. Finally, it may be significant, although not determinative, that the information would be otherwise subject to automatic disclosure under Crim. P. 16(I)(a)(1). People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).

        Defendant received adequate discovery of department of social services records.

       Subsection (2)(f) prohibits defendant from having the same direct access the prosecution has to the records. Moreover, trial court does not have an obligation through the in camera review to provide defendant all of the records, only those that are necessary for determination of an issue. People v. Jowell, 199 P.3d 38 (Colo. App. 2008).

       <b>
        Trial court need not review department of social services child abuse reports

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that nondisclosed documents were not relevant to any issue before the court.
       </b>
       Further, defendant's appellate counsel had no right to review sealed records for purposes of his appeal. Neither appellate defense counsel nor the attorney general's office was allowed access to the records, and allowing appellate defense counsel to review the entire social services file would unnecessarily sacrifice the state's interest in protecting the confidentiality of social services records. People v. Frost, 5 P.3d 317 (Colo. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Juvenile court abused its discretion when it chose to review only the last of nine volumes of department of human services' records.
       </b>
       First, after the court necessarily determined that defendant had made a sufficient showing to warrant in camera review of those records, it was obligated to review all of the records, despite the fact that such review would have imposed a significant burden on the court. Second, because subsection (2)(f) authorizes only the juvenile court to review the department of human services' records in a case such as this, only the court could determine whether any of the records might be necessary to the determination of an issue before it. People ex rel. A.D.T., 232 P.3d 313 (Colo. App. 2010).

The general assembly further finds that, while holding paramount the public safety, the juvenile justice system shall take into consideration the best interests of the juvenile, the victim, and the community in providing appropriate treatment to reduce the rate of recidivism in the juvenile justice system and to assist the juvenile in becoming a productive member of society.

        There is a very fundamental difference between a criminal proceeding and a delinquency proceeding,
       </b>
       and the clear legislative intent is that the handling of juvenile delinquents should be oriented towards rehabilitation and reformation, and not punishment as such, even though the actions of the child if committed by an adult would justify a criminal proceeding.

     <p>
      The general assembly declares that the placement of children in a detention facility exacts a negative impact on the mental and physical well-being of the child, and such detention may make it more likely that the child will reoffend. Children who are detained are more likely to penetrate deeper into the juvenile justice system than similar children who are not detained, and community-based alternatives to detention should be based on the principle of using the least-restrictive setting possible and returning a child to his or her home, family, or other responsible adult whenever possible consistent with public safety. It is the intent of the general assembly in adopting section

If available, the screening team or preadjudication service program shall file the original completed information form with the court. If the information form has not been completed at the time of the detention hearing, the court shall direct the parent or legal guardian to immediately complete the form and file it with the court.

       The local justice plan must provide for the assessment of juveniles taken into custody and detained by law enforcement officers, which assessment must be based on criteria for the placement of juveniles established pursuant to section  19-2-212, so that relevant information may be presented to the judge presiding over the detention hearing. The information provided to the court through the screening process, which information must include the record of any prior adjudication of the juvenile, is intended to enhance the court's ability to make a more appropriate detention and bond decision, based on facts relative to the juvenile's substantial risk of serious harm to others.

       The plan may include different methods and levels of community-based supervision as conditions for preadjudication release, including the possibility of release without formal supervision. The plan may provide for the use of the same supervision methods that have been established for adult defendants as a pretrial release method to reduce pretrial incarceration or that have been established as sentencing alternatives for juvenile or adult offenders placed on probation or parole. The use of such supervision methods is intended to reduce preadjudication detentions without sacrificing the protection of the community from juveniles who may be risks to the public. The plan may allow for the release of the juvenile to his or her home with no formal supervision or provide for the use of any of the following supervision methods as conditions of preadjudication release:

       19-2-311. Victim-offender conferences - pilot program.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The division of youth services is authorized to establish a pilot program, when funds become available, in its facilities to facilitate victim-initiated victim-offender conferences whereby a victim of a crime may request a facilitated conference with the juvenile who committed the crime, if the juvenile is in the custody of the division of youth services. After such a pilot program is established, the division of youth services may establish policies and procedures for the victim-offender conferences using volunteers to facilitate the conferences. The volunteers shall complete the division of youth services' volunteer and facility-specific training programs and complete high-risk victim-offender training and victim advocacy training. The division of youth services shall not compensate or reimburse a volunteer or victim for any expenses. If a pilot program is available, and subsequent to the victim's or the victim representative's request, the division of youth services shall arrange such a conference only after determining that the conference would be safe and only if the juvenile agrees to participate. The purposes of the conference are to enable the victim to meet the juvenile, to obtain answers to questions only the juvenile can answer, to assist the victim in healing from the impact of the crime, and to promote a sense of remorse and acceptance of responsibility by the juvenile that may contribute to his or her rehabilitation.

       The state department of human services is authorized to contract with a private contractor for the operation of a five-hundred-bed facility to house juveniles who are in the custody of the state department of human services and to house juveniles who are in the temporary custody of a county department of human or social services. The facility shall follow an academic model, providing educational, vocational, and positive developmental programming. The contractor shall work with the state department of human services to develop and maintain high-quality programming that is appropriate for and meets the needs of the juveniles placed in the facility. The facility must be constructed in a campus-style design and located on the parcel of real property formerly known as the Lowry bombing range. The state retains ownership of the facility constructed and operated pursuant to this section. Nothing in this section requires that the parcel of real property formerly known as the Lowry bombing range be used exclusively for the facility constructed pursuant to this section.

       The contractor shall require applicants for employment at the facility to submit a set of fingerprints to the Colorado bureau of investigation for a criminal background check, and the Colorado bureau of investigation may accept such fingerprints. For the purpose of conducting background checks, to the extent authorized by federal law, the Colorado bureau of investigation may exchange with the department any state, multistate, and federal criminal history records of individuals who apply for employment at the facility. When the results of a fingerprint-based criminal history record check of an applicant performed pursuant to this section reveal a record of arrest without a disposition, the contractor shall require that applicant to submit to a name-based criminal history record check, as defined in section  22-2-119.3 (6)(d).

       When a juvenile is taken into temporary custody and not released pending charges, the officer shall notify the screening team for the judicial district in which the juvenile is taken into custody. The screening team shall notify the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian without unnecessary delay and inform him or her that, if the juvenile is placed in detention or a temporary holding facility, all parties have a right to a prompt hearing to determine whether the juvenile is to be detained further. Such notification may be made to a person with whom the juvenile is residing if a parent, guardian, or legal custodian cannot be located. If the screening team is unable to make such notification, it may be made by any law enforcement officer, juvenile probation officer, detention center counselor, or common jailor in whose physical custody the juvenile is placed.

The law enforcement officer, screening team, or juvenile court shall not remove the juvenile from the custody of the parent or legal guardian pursuant to this section unless the screening team or the juvenile court:

           Finds that the juvenile poses a substantial risk of serious harm to others or a substantial risk of flight from prosecution and finds that community-based alternatives to detention are insufficient to reasonably mitigate that risk. Flight from prosecution is distinguished from simple failure to appear and must generally be evidenced by a demonstrated record of repeat, recent willful failures to appear at a scheduled court appearance.

         Any information concerning a juvenile that is obtained during the administration of the detention screening instrument must be used solely for the purpose of making a recommendation to the court regarding the continued detention of the juvenile. The information is not subject to subpoena or other court process, for use in any other proceeding, or for any other purpose.

The court may make reasonable orders as conditions of release pursuant to section  19-2-508 (5). In addition, the court may provide that any violation of such orders may subject the juvenile to contempt sanctions of the court.

       Unless placement is prohibited pursuant to section  19-2-507.5, when a juvenile is placed in a detention facility, in a temporary holding facility, or in a temporary shelter facility designated by the court, the screening team shall promptly notify the court, the district attorney, and the local office of the state public defender. The screening team shall also notify a parent or legal guardian or, if a parent or legal guardian cannot be located within the county, the person with whom the juvenile has been residing and inform him or her of the right to a prompt hearing to determine whether the juvenile is to be detained further. The court shall hold the detention hearing within forty-eight hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. For a juvenile being held in detention on a warrant for violating a valid court order on a status offense, the court shall hold the detention hearing within twenty-four hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.

The time of the detention hearing must allow defense counsel sufficient time to consult with the juvenile before the detention hearing.

The time in which the hearing must be held may be extended for a reasonable time by order of the court upon good cause shown.

Upon completion of the detention hearing, the defense shall return any materials received pursuant to this subsection (3)(a)(II) unless the appointment is continued at the conclusion of the hearing.

           The only purposes of a detention hearing are to determine if a juvenile should be detained further and to define conditions under which he or she may be released, if his or her release is appropriate. A detention hearing shall not be combined with a preliminary hearing or a first advisement. Due to the limited scope of a detention hearing, the representation of a juvenile by appointed counsel at a detention hearing does not, by itself, create a basis for disqualification in the event that such counsel is subsequently appointed to represent another individual whose case is related to the juvenile's case.

             The juvenile poses a substantial risk of serious harm to others or a substantial risk of flight from prosecution and community-based alternatives to detention are insufficient to reasonably mitigate that risk.

        This section does not violate constitutional guarantees of due process to juveniles.
       </b>
       Juveniles do not have an absolute constitutional right to bail and the presumption statute does not impermissibly shift the burden of proof from the state to the juvenile with respect to establishing whether secure detention is warranted. Instead, the statute merely requires the juvenile to introduce some evidence to overcome the presumption of dangerousness created by the statute. People v. Juvenile Court, 893 P.2d 81 (Colo. 1995).

        Detention hearing required whether placement is in shelter or detention facility.
       </b>
       The term "detention hearing", in the context of subsection (2), refers to a situation where a child is placed in a shelter facility as well as a situation where a child is placed in a detention facility. In both situations the child is removed from the custody of the parents, and both the statute and due process require a prompt hearing to determine whether the welfare of the child or of the community require that the "detention" continue.

       Trial court's findings that confinement of juveniles in certain secure detention facilities constituted punishment did not resolve the issue of the facial validity of the statute creating a presumption of dangerousness.

       If the petition is the first juvenile petition filed against the juvenile in any jurisdiction and is initiated in a jurisdiction that has restorative justice practices available, the district attorney or his or her designee may determine whether a juvenile is suitable for restorative justice practices. The district attorney shall consider whether the victim, having been informed about restorative justice practices pursuant to section  24-4.1-303 (11)(g), C.R.S., is requesting consideration of restorative justice practices as an alternative to formal prosecution; the seriousness of the crime; the crime's impact on the victim; the best methodology to involve the victim; whether the juvenile accepts responsibility for, expresses remorse for, and is willing to repair the harm caused by his or her actions; whether the juvenile's parent or legal guardian is willing to support the juvenile in the process; and other programmatic support available. If a juvenile wants to participate in restorative justice practices, the juvenile must make the request to the district attorney or the law enforcement agency administering the program and may not make the request to the victim. If requested by the juvenile, restorative justice practices may only be conducted after the victim is consulted by the district attorney and offered an opportunity to participate or submit a victim impact statement. If a victim elects not to attend, a victim-offender conference may be held with a suitable victim surrogate or victim advocate, and the victim may submit a victim impact statement. The district attorney may offer dismissal of charges as an option for the successful completion of these and any other conditions imposed and designed to address the harm done to the victim and the community by the offender, subject to approval by the court.

       The former statute contained an exception for cases for which another law limited or removed that court's jurisdiction.

       violent juvenile offender's right to equal protection was not violated where the elements constituting an aggravated juvenile offender differ from those constituting a violent juvenile offender. People in Interest of M.M.O.P., 873 P.2d 24 (Colo. App. 1993).

        Subsection (5)(a)(I)(A) gives a court discretion in sentencing an aggravated juvenile offender and does not require a commitment sentence to the department of human services.
       </b>
       The court's decision to suspend the commitment sentence on condition of successfully completing probation for an offense that did not constitute a class 1 or 2 felony if committed by an adult was permitted by the sentencing law. A.S. v. People, 2013 CO 63, 312 P.3d 168.

        Section does not address appropriate sentencing options for an aggravated juvenile offender who, at 22 years of age, is already an adult at the time of sentencing for acts committed as a juvenile.
       </b>
       Since aggravated juvenile offenders must be sentenced pursuant to this section, there is a gap in the statute that must be filled by the legislature. Therefore, courts sentencing aggravated juvenile offenders who have aged out of the department of human services at the time of sentencing may apply the provisions of subsection (8) that do not require participation by the department of human services and consider all available sentencing options listed under subsection (8).

       The district attorney or a juvenile who is accused in a petition of a delinquent act that constitutes a class 1, 2, or 3 felony may demand and receive a preliminary hearing to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the delinquent act alleged in the petition was committed by the juvenile. In addition, the district attorney or a juvenile who is accused in a petition of only those delinquent acts that constitute class 4, 5, or 6 felonies which felonies require mandatory sentencing or which constitute crimes of violence as defined in section  18-1.3-406, C.R.S., or which constitute sexual offenses under part 4 of article 3 of title 18, C.R.S., may demand and receive a preliminary hearing to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the delinquent act alleged in the petition was committed by the juvenile. A preliminary hearing may be heard by a judge of the juvenile court or by a magistrate and shall be conducted as follows:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t19-ar02-p07-s19-2-705ol11a">
         At the juvenile's advisement hearing and after the filing of the delinquency petition, the prosecution shall make available to the juvenile the discovery material required by the Colorado rules of juvenile procedure. The juvenile or the prosecution may file a written motion for a preliminary hearing, stating the basis therefor. Upon the filing of the motion, the court shall forthwith set the matter for a hearing. The juvenile or the prosecution shall file a written motion for a preliminary hearing not later than ten days after the advisement hearing.
        </li>
        <li id="t19-ar02-p07-s19-2-705ol11b">
         If the juvenile is being detained because of the delinquent act alleged in the petition, the preliminary hearing shall be held within thirty days of the filing of the motion, unless good cause for continuing the hearing beyond that time is shown to the court. If the juvenile is not being detained, it shall be held as promptly as the calendar of the court permits.
        </li>
        <li id="t19-ar02-p07-s19-2-705ol11c">
         At the preliminary hearing, the juvenile shall not be called upon to plead, although the juvenile may cross-examine the prosecution witnesses and may introduce evidence in his or her own behalf. The prosecution shall have the burden of establishing probable cause. The court at the hearing may temper the rules of evidence in the exercise of sound judicial discretion.
        </li>
        <li id="t19-ar02-p07-s19-2-705ol11d">
         If the court determines that probable cause exists, it shall enter a finding to that effect and shall schedule an adjudicatory trial. If from the evidence it appears to the court that probable cause does not exist, it shall dismiss the delinquency petition, and the juvenile shall be discharged from any restriction or other previous temporary order stemming from the petition.

Such dispositional hearing may be heard by a judge of the juvenile court or by a magistrate.

           <li id="t19-ar02-p07-s19-2-705ol11-1.5b">
            Any juvenile accused of a class 4, 5, or 6 felony who is not otherwise entitled to a preliminary hearing pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (1.5), may demand and shall receive a preliminary hearing within a reasonable time pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, if the juvenile is in custody; except that, upon motion of either party, the court shall vacate the preliminary hearing if there is a reasonable showing that the juvenile has been released from custody prior to the preliminary hearing.

The mental health screening or assessment and any information obtained in the course of the mental health screening or assessment is not subject to subpoena or any other court process for use in any other court proceeding and is not admissible on the issues raised by a plea of not guilty unless the juvenile places his or her mental health at issue.

        An adjudication of delinquency is sufficient to establish a conclusive presumption of intent when intent is an element of the offense,

       Where a minor child aged 16 was alleged to be a delinquent, grounded on the allegation that he had committed an assault and battery, but at the close of the evidence presented by the people, the court ruled that the evidence presented was not sufficient to sustain the allegations of the petition and entered a judgment of acquittal, on appeal by the people it was held that the case was moot. The minor had been acquitted of the charge contained in the petition and could not again be put in jeopardy for this offense. People in Interest of G.D.K. v. G.D.K., 30

        The written minute order waiving juvenile court jurisdiction triggered the requirement for the prosecution to file an information in district court

       within five days of the issuance of the order and, since the time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional, the prosecution's failure to file an information within that time limit rendered the waiver null and void and the juvenile court was required to retain jurisdiction.

If the juvenile participates in a restorative justice practices victim-offender conference, the facilitator shall provide these services for a fee of no more than one hundred twenty-five dollars based on a sliding scale; however, the fee may be waived by the court.

Such a sentence is a condition of probation for higher-risk juveniles who would have otherwise been sentenced to detention or out-of-home placement or committed to the department of human services. A sentence pursuant to this section is conditioned on the availability of space in the community accountability program and on a determination by the division of youth services that the juvenile's participation in the program is appropriate. In the event that the division of youth services determines the program is at maximum capacity or that a juvenile's participation is not appropriate, the juvenile must be ordered to return to the sentencing court for another sentencing hearing.

Any evidence having probative value is admissible regardless of its admissibility under exclusionary rules of evidence if the parolee is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut hearsay evidence.

Such review may be held if a written request is filed within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing before the hearing panel.

If the court feels that the information available to it is inadequate for making such a finding, it shall order a competency examination.

       The court shall immediately notify the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel of the preliminary finding regarding competency. The prosecuting attorney or the defense counsel may request a hearing on the preliminary finding by filing a written request with the court within ten days after the date on which the court issues the preliminary finding, unless the court extends the time period for good cause. The preliminary finding becomes a final determination if neither the prosecuting attorney nor defense counsel requests a hearing. Upon the timely written request of either the prosecuting attorney or defense counsel, the court shall hold a competency hearing. If the court did not order a competency examination or other evaluation prior to its preliminary determination and the court determines adequate mental health information is not available, the court shall refer the juvenile for a competency examination prior to the hearing. At the conclusion of the competency hearing, the court shall make a final determination regarding the juvenile's competency to proceed. At a competency hearing held pursuant to this subsection (2), the burden of submitting evidence and the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence are upon the party asserting the incompetency of the juvenile.

If the court declares a mistrial under these circumstances, the juvenile must not be deemed to have been placed in jeopardy with regard to the charges at issue. The juvenile may be tried on, and sentenced if adjudicated for, the same charges after he or she has achieved or been restored to competency.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the stability and preservation of the families of this state and the safety and protection of children are matters of statewide concern. The general assembly finds that the federal "Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980", federal Public Law 96-272, requires that each state make a commitment to make "reasonable efforts" to prevent the placement of abused and neglected children out of the home and to reunify the family whenever appropriate.
      </li>
      <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol12">
       The general assembly further finds that the federal "Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997", federal Public Law 105-89, clarifies what constitutes "reasonable efforts" by decreeing that when deciding whether to make such efforts and in the process of making such efforts, the health and safety of the child is the paramount concern. This federal law further encourages expediting permanency planning for children in out-of-home placement by removing barriers to permanency and streamlining entitlement services. The law specifies that one of the goals of all placement decisions, whether leaving the child in the home or placing the child outside the home, is safety for the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol13">
       The general assembly further finds that the implementation of the federal "Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980", federal Public Law 96-272, is not the exclusive responsibility of the state department of social services or of local departments of social services. Elected officials at the state and local levels must ensure that resources and services are available through state and local social services agencies and through the involvement of the resources of public and private sources. Judges, attorneys, and guardians ad litem must be encouraged to take independent responsibility to ensure that "reasonable efforts" to prevent out-of-home placements have been made only when appropriate, that permanency occurs for children in foster care, and that safe child placements occur in each case.

          <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol14aI">
           The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that emotional and cognitive disruptions in the early lives of children have the potential to impair brain development. Paramount in the lives of children in foster care is their need for continuity with their primary attachment figures and a sense of permanence that is enhanced when the child's placement is stable.
          </li>
          <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol14aII">
           The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that attachment to a primary caregiver is essential to the development of emotional security and social conscience; and
          </li>
          <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol14aIII">
           According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, optimal child development occurs when a spectrum of needs is consistently met over an extended period. Separation of a child from his or her primary caregiver occurring between six months and three years of age is more likely to result in subsequent emotional disturbances for the child than if the separation occurs when the child is older. Repeated moves from home to home compound the adverse consequences of separation. Further, the younger the child and the more extended the period of uncertainty or separation, the more detrimental the separation will be to the child's well-being. Any intervention that separates a child from the child's primary caregiver or person who provides psychological support to the child should be cautiously considered and treated as a matter of urgency and profound importance.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol14b">
         The general assembly further finds that older children in foster care are at a high risk of having long-term mental health issues, dropping out of school, developing alcohol and drug dependence, experiencing promiscuity, and interacting with the criminal justice system. Multiple moves for older children lead to disruption in schooling and meaningful relationships and attachments, including relationships with peers and family of origin. As a result these children have few, if any, long-term connections when they leave foster care, resulting in little support for their growth into independent adults.
        </li>
        <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol14c">
         The general assembly therefore declares that multiple moves for children in the dependency and neglect system should be discouraged in favor of permanent planning upon which these children can rely for their healthy mental, physical, and emotional development.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t19-ar03-p01-s19-3-100.5ol15">
       Therefore, in order to carry out the requirements addressed in this section, to ensure stability in placements, to preserve families, and to decrease the need for out-of-home placement, the general assembly shall define "reasonable efforts" and identify the services and processes that must be in place to ensure that "reasonable efforts" have been made. The general assembly provides that "reasonable efforts" are deemed to be met when a county or city and county provides services in accordance with section  19-3-208 and when full consideration has been given to the provisions of section  24-34-805 (2).

        Colorado Children's Code defines a "child" as a person under 18 years of age. When the general assembly amended the definition of child in 1967 and removed the reference to an unborn child, the intent was to change the law and no longer subject an unborn child to the provisions of the Children's Code. Additionally, the remedies that are available in dependency and neglect actions support the conclusion that an unborn child is not subject to the Children's Code.

In addition, the guardian ad litem, if in the best interest of the child, shall seek to assure that reasonable efforts are being made to prevent unnecessary placement of the child out of the home and to facilitate reunification of the child with the child's family or, if reunification is not possible, to find another safe and permanent living arrangement for the child. In determining whether said reasonable efforts are made with respect to a child, and in making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern.

       If there is such an objection, the trial court must conduct a hearing and specifically determine whether the petition is supported by a preponderance of the evidence and the child is in fact dependent and neglected.

        Quasi-judicial immunity.
       </b>

        Determination of whether a guardian ad litem may be examined and cross-examined depends on the manner in which the guardian chooses to proceed in fulfilling the statutory requirements of the position.
       </b>
       If a guardian presents a recommendation based on an independent investigation, the facts of which have not otherwise been introduced into evidence, the guardian functions as a witness in the proceedings and, thus, should be subject to examination and cross-examination as to the bases for the opinion and recommendation. If the guardian's recommendations are based upon the evidence received by the court from other sources, then they are analogous to arguments made by counsel and examination and cross-examination should not be permitted. Therefore, the trial court did not err in limiting a mother's examination of her children's guardian ad litem during the hearing on terminating the parent-child legal relationship where the record demonstrated that the guardian had chosen to examine the witnesses called by others and to present his recommendations in the form of legal argument based upon the facts and opinions testified to by others.

      The general assembly declares that the complete reporting of child abuse is a matter of public concern and that, in enacting this part 3, it is the intent of the general assembly to protect the best interests of children of this state and to offer protective services in order to prevent any further harm to a child suffering from abuse. It is also the intent of the general assembly that if a county or group of counties decides to establish a child protection team, that the child protection teams publicly discuss public agencies' responses to child abuse and neglect reports so that the public and the general assembly are better informed concerning the operation and administration of this part 3.

       The information reported verbally by counselor in phone call to police and in subsequent written form was relevant to counselor's ability to determine whether defendant's "visions" had any basis in reality and as such constituted a legitimate report of suspected child abuse and was therefore exempt from confidentiality requirements under federal statute for substance abuse treatment records.

The agreements must provide for special requests by one agency for assistance from the other agency and for joint investigations by both agencies.

       Any interview of a child conducted pursuant to section  19-3-308, concerning a report of child abuse, may be audiotaped or videotaped. However, interviews concerning reports of sexual child abuse are strongly encouraged to be videotaped. Any audiotaped or videotaped interview shall be conducted by a competent interviewer at a child advocacy center, as that term is defined in section  19-1-103 (19.5), that has a memorandum of understanding with the agency responsible for the investigation or by a competent interviewer for the agency responsible for the investigation in accordance with such section; except that an interview shall not be videotaped when doing so is impracticable under the circumstances or will result in trauma to the child, as determined by the investigating agency. No more than one videotaped interview shall be required unless the interviewer or the investigating agency determines that additional interviews are necessary to complete an investigation. Additional interviews shall be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same interviewer. Such recordings shall be preserved as evidence in the manner and for a period provided by law for maintaining such evidence. In addition, access to such recordings shall be subject to the rules of discovery under the Colorado rules of criminal and civil procedure.

In addition, an agency that enters into a memorandum of understanding with a child advocacy center that provides technical assistance for forensic interviews, forensic medical examinations, or evidence collection or preservation may require that the child advocacy center meets the national performance standards for children's advocacy centers as established by the national accrediting body. These standards include, but are not limited to, standards for forensic interviews to be conducted in a manner which is of a neutral, fact-finding nature and coordinated to avoid duplicative interviewing.

    As a result of the report of the state auditor evaluating the performance of the state central registry of child protection released in November of 2001 and the subsequent repeal of the state central registry of child protection, the general assembly hereby finds and declares that it is in the best interests of the children and the citizens of the state of Colorado for the state department to modify the processing of records and reports of child abuse or neglect. These modifications are intended to ensure that the state department is able to provide reliable, accurate, and timely information concerning records and reports of child abuse or neglect.

Finally, these modifications are intended to ensure that the state department's procedural systems related to records and reports of child abuse or neglect provide adequate protection to the children and the citizens of the state of Colorado.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The court may find that it is not necessary to remove a child from his or her home to a temporary shelter facility and may provide temporary shelter in the child's home by authorizing a representative of the county or district department of human or social services, which has emergency caretaker services available, to remain in the child's home with the child until a parent, legal guardian, or relative of the child enters the home and expresses willingness and has the apparent ability, as determined by the state department, to resume charge of the child. In no event must such period of time exceed seventy-two hours. In the case of a relative, the relative is to assume charge of the child until a parent or legal guardian enters the home and expresses willingness and has the apparent ability, as determined by the state department, to resume charge of the child. The director of the county or district department of human or social services shall designate in writing the representatives of the county or district departments of human or social services authorized to perform such duties.

        Temporary protective custody orders are not subject to appeal.
       </b>
       Temporary protective custody orders are interim orders pending a final factual determination of the allegations set forth in the petition in dependency or neglect. Because they are of short duration and terminate with the ruling of the preliminary injunction, an immediate appeal is not necessary to protect the rights of the parties. People ex rel.

       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t19-ar03-p05-s19-3-500.2ol11a">
         It is beneficial for a child who is removed from his or her home and placed in foster care to be able to continue relationships with his or her brothers and sisters, regardless of age, in order that the siblings may share their strengths and association in their everyday and often common experiences. The general assembly also finds that the initial decisions about temporary placement of a child may affect the ultimate permanent placement of the child or of the children in a sibling group.

         When placing children in foster care, efforts should be made to place siblings together, unless there is a danger of specific harm to a child or it is not in the child's or children's best interests to be placed together. The general assembly further finds that if the county department locates an appropriate, capable, willing, and available joint placement for all of the children in the sibling group, there should be a rebuttable presumption that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is in the best interests of the children. Such presumption should be rebuttable by a preponderance of the evidence that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is not in the best interests of a child or of the children.

       The general assembly also declares that nothing in this article regarding the placement of sibling groups together should be construed as requiring the removal of a child from his or her home and placement into foster care if that is not in the best interests of the child.

         Adjudication of dependency and neglect was proper

         Was also proper

        where the jury verdict was based on allegations in the petition in dependency and neglect; the only argument presented to support the finding of dependency was the allegation in the petition of the act of sexual molestation initially told to a pediatrician by the child and subsequently investigated by the department of social services; the father did not contend that the jury's determination rested on some unknown other incident and not the sole allegation concerning him; and the verdict was intended to be a determination of the status of the child, and not a specific finding of the acts creating that status.

The statement shall contain an explanation of the services or actions that, had such services or actions been available, would have been necessary to enable the child to remain at home safely. In the alternative, the caseworker may submit a statement as to why no services or actions would have made it possible for the child to remain at home safely. If the child is part of a sibling group, as defined in section  19-1-103 (98.5), and the child was not placed with his or her siblings, the caseworker shall submit to the court a statement about whether it continues to be in the best interests of the child or the children in the sibling group to be placed separately. If the caseworker locates an appropriate, capable, willing, and available joint placement for all of the children in the sibling group, it shall be presumed that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is in the best interests of the children. Such presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is not in the best interests of a child or of the children.

         The court may place legal custody in the county department of human or social services or a child placement agency for placement in a foster care home or other child care facility. When the child is part of a sibling group and the sibling group is being placed out of the home, if the county department locates an appropriate, capable, willing, and available joint placement for all of the children in the sibling group, it is presumed that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is in the best interests of the children. Such presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is not in the best interests of a child or of the children.

If so requested by the court, it is the function of the welfare department to aid the court in the court's pursuit of its obligations. People in Interest of M.D.C.M., 34

        Section not violative of equal protection.
       </b>
       Where lack of an extended family or financial resources were not factors in termination and where termination is based on a parent's failure or inability to comply with a treatment plan, parental unfitness, and unlikelihood of change in the future, a termination of parental rights is not violative of equal protection under the law. People in Interest of M.M., 726 P.2d 1108 (Colo. 1986).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (1)(b)(III) does not violate due process.
       </b>
       The court recognizes that a parent has a fundamental right in the care, custody, and management of a child. The state has a compelling interest to assure that a
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colorado child is neither neglected nor dependent, and that a stable home atmosphere exists for the child. Therefore, if a parent cannot provide such an environment within a reasonable time, the state has a compelling interest in terminating the rights of the parent.

       </cite>
       (Colo. App. 1998).

      <p>
       <b>
        Statute does not violate equal protection clause rights of mentally ill parents
       </b>
       because parental rights of such parents are not terminable on the basis of mental illness alone. People in Interest of C.B., 740 P.2d 11 (Colo. 1987); People in Interest of C.Z.,

       <b>
        Section not violative of due process.
       </b>
       This section is sufficiently definite to provide notice of the conduct or conditions upon which termination of the relationship can be predicated, adequately minimizes the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory application, and gives the courts sufficient guidelines to enable them to apply the law consistently and in accord with legislative intent, and therefore does not violate due process of law. People in Interest of M.S.H., 656 P.2d 1294 (Colo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (1) is permissive with court.
       </b>
       The court is granted discretion in making its decision to terminate parental rights. People in Interest of K.C., 685 P.2d 1377 (Colo. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A motion to terminate is sufficient so long as it is couched in the statutory language set forth in subsection (1).
       </b>
       People ex rel. T.D., 140 P.3d 205 (Colo. App. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1020, 127 S. Ct. 564, 166 L. Ed. 2d 411, and 549 U.S. 1024, 127 S. Ct. 565, 166 L. Ed. 2d 419 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A written adjudicatory order, a minute order reflecting the approval of a treatment plan, and a copy of the treatment plan are sufficient to establish for purposes of subsection (1)(c) that the children were adjudicated dependent or neglected.
       </b>
       That the adjudicatory order did not become appealable until the judgment of termination was entered does not undermine or affect either its validity or its probative value. People ex rel. J.M., 74 P.3d 475 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The requirements of subsection (1)(c) are not jurisdictional.
       </b>
       The court's failure to enter adjudicatory order was not an error affecting the court's jurisdiction to enter termination order. Mother admitted the child was dependent and neglected, the court accepted that admission, and mother voluntarily participated in the termination proceedings without objecting to the absence of an adjudicatory order, thereby waiving any procedural error arising from subsection (1)(c). People ex rel. N.D.V., 224 P.3d 410 (Colo. App. 2009); People in Interest of J.W., 2017 CO 105, 406 P.3d 853.

       <b>
        The term "reasonable parental care" is not too indefinite
       </b>
       to satisfy constitutional standards. This term must be interpreted in light of the specific factors in subsection (2) which the court is directed to consider in determining whether a parent is unwilling or unable to give a child reasonable parental care. People in Interest of M.S.H., 656 P.2d 1294 (Colo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Termination of parental rights is a decision of paramount gravity,

       and the state must exercise extreme caution in terminating such rights. People in Interest of M.C.C., 641 P.2d 306 (Colo. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination is an unfortunate but necessary remedy when all reasonable means of establishing a satisfactory parent-child relationship have been tried and found wanting. It is not a desired outcome for which the state should strive from the inception of a dependency or neglect proceeding. People in Interest of A.M.D., 648 P.2d 625 (Colo. 1982).

       <b>
        Strict compliance with termination standards required.

        This section sets forth the criteria
       </b>

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The court must hold a dispositional hearing
       </b>
       and consider an appropriate treatment plan at the time or within 45 days of declaring the child dependent or neglected before terminating parental rights. People ex rel. D.R.W, 91 P.3d 453 (Colo. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Consideration of alternatives to termination.
       </b>
       A trial court must consider and eliminate less drastic alternatives to termination of the parent-child relationship. People in Interest of M.M., 726 P.2d 1108 (Colo. 1986); People ex rel. J.M.B., 60 P.3d 790 (Colo. App. 2002); People ex rel. D.B-J., 89 P.3d 530 (Colo. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a trial court's findings conform to the statutory criteria for termination and are adequately supported by evidence in the record, a reviewing court may presume that, in the absence of any indication in the record to the contrary, the trial court considered and eliminated less drastic alternatives to termination. People in Interest of M.M., 726 1108 (Colo. 1986); People ex rel. T.D., 140 P.3d 205 (Colo. App. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1020, 127 S. Ct. 564, 166 L. Ed. 2d 411, and 549 U.S. 1024, 127 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (1) does not require that the court explicitly consider "less drastic alternatives" before ordering termination,
       </b>
       and court's termination order concluding that the child had been adjudicated dependent and neglected, that the parent had not complied with and could not comply with the approved treatment plan, that the parent was an unfit parent, and that her condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time was sufficient to conform to termination requirements of this section, and a reviewing court may presume that, in the absence of any indication in the record to the contrary, the trial court considered and eliminated less drastic alternatives. C.S. v. People, 83 P.3d 627 (Colo. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No error where court failed to consider placement of children with paternal grandparents.

       19-3-612. Reinstatement of the parent-child legal relationship - circumstances - petition - hearings - legislative declaration.
      </b>
     </h3>

      <li id="t19-ar03-p06-s19-3-612ol11">
       The general assembly finds that, for various reasons, some children are not adopted after the termination or voluntary relinquishment of the parent-child legal relationship and in some cases might benefit from a reinstatement of the parent-child legal relationship if the former parent has remediated the issues that led to the termination or voluntary relinquishment. The purpose of this section is to address the problem of children who linger in the child welfare system by giving them a second chance at achieving permanency with their rehabilitated former parent. The purpose of this section is to create a process by which the former parent's legal rights may be restored if certain conditions are met, both the child and the former parent want reinstatement of the relationship, a trial period is successful, and it is found to be in the best interests of the child. Reinstatement is a recognition that the situation of the former parent and child has changed since the time of the termination or voluntary relinquishment of the parent-child legal relationship, and reunification is now appropriate and in the best interests of the child.

       A county department with custody of a child whose parent's rights were terminated voluntarily or involuntarily, including a child whose parent relinquished the child pursuant to the requirements of article 5 of this title 19, or the guardian ad litem of such a child, may file a petition to reinstate the parent-child legal relationship alleging the following:

As part of the transition plan, the county department shall provide transition services, as needed. The county department shall assess the visitation or temporary placement of the child with the former parent and prepare a report about the success of the visitation or temporary placement. The county department shall submit the report to the court, the former parent, and the guardian ad litem not later than thirty days prior to the expiration of the designated trial period. The county department may stop the visitation or remove the child from placement with the former parent at any time, in accordance with the procedures outlined in sections  19-3-401 and  19-3-403, if it deems that the child is not safe or that it is no longer in the best interests of the child for the child to remain with the former parent.

       If, under the supervision of a licensed physician or advanced practice nurse and with the consent of her husband, a wife consents to assisted reproduction with sperm donated by a man not her husband, the husband is treated in law as if he were the natural father of a child thereby conceived. If, under the supervision of a licensed physician or advanced practice nurse and with the consent of her husband, a wife consents to assisted reproduction with an egg donated by another woman, to conceive a child for herself, not as a surrogate, the wife is treated in law as if she were the natural mother of a child thereby conceived. Both the husband's and the wife's consent must be in writing and signed by each of them. The physician or advanced practice nurse shall certify their signatures and the date of the assisted reproduction and shall file the consents with the department of public health and environment, where they shall be kept confidential and in a sealed file; however, the physician's failure to do so does not affect the father and child relationship or the mother and child relationship.

It was error for the court to have conducted a paternity proceeding under the petition for support proceedings of article 7. People in Interest of L.B., 29 Colo.

       If the presumption of legitimacy of children born to a married woman is overcome, it would still be incumbent on a petitioner to establish to the satisfaction of a trial court that a respondent was the father of a child, but he cannot rely on the outmoded and archaic conclusiveness of a presumption in the light of facts which a petitioner offers to prove.

       In a paternity action, the question of whether the child is to be exhibited before the trier of fact is a discretionary matter on the part of the trial court, and its determination will be upheld on review in the absence of an abuse of that discretion.

       Exhibition of a child to the jury in a paternity action for the purpose of showing general resemblance without expert testimony effectively denies the respondent the right of cross-examination, because the mere exhibition of a child without comment leaves a jury with the uncontroverted inference of similarities between such child and the alleged father.

       On the basis of the information produced at the pretrial hearing, the judge or magistrate conducting the hearing shall evaluate the probability of determining the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of the relationship would be in the best interest of the child. On the basis of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement shall be made to the parties, which may include any of the following:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t19-ar04-s19-4-114ol11a">

In reviewing the obligation undertaken by the alleged father in a compromise agreement, the judge or magistrate conducting the hearing shall consider the best interest of the child, in the light of the factors enumerated in section  19-4-116 (6), discounted by the improbability, as it appears to him, of establishing the alleged father's paternity or nonpaternity of the child in a trial of the action. In the best interest of the child, the court may order that the alleged father's identity be kept confidential. In that case, the court may designate a person or agency to receive from the alleged father and disburse on behalf of the child all amounts paid by the alleged father in fulfillment of obligations imposed on him.

       If a party refuses to accept a recommendation made under subsection (1) of this section and genetic tests have not been taken, the court shall require the parties to submit to genetic tests, if practicable. Thereafter, the judge or magistrate shall make an appropriate final recommendation. If a party refuses to accept the final recommendation, the action shall be set for trial. If the evidence relating to paternity meets the requirements set forth in section  13-25-126 (1)(g), C.R.S., the court shall issue temporary orders establishing current child support, foster care maintenance, and medical support to remain in effect pending a final disposition of the proceeding.

       The general assembly hereby finds that parental relinquishment and adoption of children are important and necessary options to facilitate the permanent placement of minor children if the birth parents are unable or unwilling to provide proper parental care. The general assembly further finds that adoption offers significant psychological, legal, economic, and social benefits not only for children who might otherwise be homeless but also for parents who are unable to care for their children and for adoptive parents who desire children to nurture, care for, and support. Conversely, the general assembly recognizes that disrupted adoptive placements often have a profound and negative impact on individuals, particularly children, involved in the adoption proceedings.
      </li>
      <li id="t19-ar05-p01-s19-5-100.2ol12">
       It is the purpose of this article 5 to promote the integrity and finality of adoptions to ensure that children placed in adoptive placements will be raised in stable, loving, and permanent families. It is the further intent of the general assembly that a prospective parent with a disability should not be denied the opportunity to provide a permanent adoptive placement for a child based solely on the parent's disability, as provided for in section  24-34-805 (2). The general assembly intends that by enacting this legislation, it will be protecting children from being uprooted from adoptive placements and from the life-long emotional and psychological trauma that often accompanies being indiscriminately moved.

        The purpose of this section
       </b>
       is to prevent the relinquishment of a child by parents who do not realize the seriousness and finality of their acts. It does not provide that the department of welfare or the court should argue with the parents concerning the reasons for their relinquishment or seek to thwart the exercise of their free and voluntary will.

        Relinquishment does not require known identity of adoptive parents.

        Grounds for reversal of order for relinquishment.
       </b>
       Once the order for relinquishment has been granted, it cannot be reversed except where the court lacks jurisdiction, or when consent of the parents is obtained through fraud, overreaching pressure, or duress. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144

       Where the child has not been adopted prior to an attack on a relinquishment decree and mistake and misunderstanding invalidated the parents' consent to the relinquishment, a court may reverse the final order of relinquishment. People In re J.B.P., 44

        Void decree subject to collateral attack.
       </b>
       Where statutory requirements are not met, the court cannot enter a valid adoption decree, and the decree is thereby absolutely void on its face and may be the subject of a collateral attack, and the lack of these jurisdictional matters made the decree subject to an attack at any stage of the proceedings or after entry of judgment. The lack of jurisdiction is usually shown by the judgment roll, and in adoption cases the record constitutes the judgment roll. Fackerell v. District Court, 133

        Motion to vacate order of relinquishment properly denied.

       In a proceeding by the natural parents of a minor child to set aside a relinquishment and consent to adoption, where it is shown that the court had jurisdiction, and there being no allegation of coercion, duress, or pressure exerted upon the parents to induce them to relinquish the child, a motion to vacate such consent was properly denied.

        Time limit between petition and hearing.
       </b>
       Although no time limit is prescribed by statute for hearing after the filing of a petition for the relinquishment and adoption of a minor child, reasonable time should elapse between the filing of the petition and a hearing thereon, permitting the court to examine into the facts to determine whether relinquishment is advisable under the circumstances.

If any of them waives his or her right to appear and contest or fails to appear or, if appearing, cannot personally assume legal and physical custody, taking into account the child's age, needs, and individual circumstances, such person's parent-child legal relationship with reference to the child shall be terminated. If the other birth parent or a person representing himself or herself to be the other birth parent appears and demonstrates the desire and ability to personally assume legal and physical custody of the child, taking into account the child's age, needs, and individual circumstances, the court shall proceed to determine parentage under article 4 of this title. If the court determines that the person is the other birth parent, the court shall set a hearing, as expeditiously as possible, to determine whether the interests of the child or of the community require that the other parent's rights be terminated or, if they are not terminated, to determine whether:

       The general assembly hereby declares that the purpose of this statute is to protect a person in a case where it is determined that he or she is a victim of sexual assault but in which no conviction occurred and to protect a child conceived as a result of that sexual assault by creating a process to seek termination of the parental rights of the perpetrator of the sexual assault and by issuing protective orders preventing future contact between the parties. The general assembly further declares that this section creates civil remedies and is not created to punish the perpetrator but rather to protect the interests of the petitioner and the child.

         When placing children in adoptive placements, efforts should be made to place siblings together, unless there is a danger of specific harm to a child or it is not in the child's or children's best interests to be placed together. The general assembly further finds that if the county department locates an appropriate, capable, willing, and available joint placement for all of the children in the sibling group, there should be a rebuttable presumption that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is in the best interests of the children. Such presumption should be rebuttable by a preponderance of the evidence that placement of the entire sibling group in the joint placement is not in the best interests of a child or of the children.

         contemplates two types of adoptions.
        </b>
        The first is an adoption in which the rights of the parents are terminated by the court or are relinquished by the parents, or by the child's guardian if the parents are deceased. In such situation, final decree of adoption has effect of divesting the child's natural parents of all legal rights and obligations with respect to the child. The second is a "stepparent adoption", which constitutes the only exception to the general rule that an adoption divests both of the child's parents of all legal rights and duties relating to the child. This exception applies only when custodial parent is married to the adopting stepparent. Adoption of T.K.J., 931 P.2d 488 (Colo. App. 1996); In re D.S.L., 18 P.3d 856 (Colo. App. 2001).

         Responsibility of state to protect child's best interests.
        </b>
        In an adoption proceeding, not only the custody, support, and education of a minor is involved, but one or both the parents may be deprived of their rights as parents. In such cases the state has an obligation to see that the best interests of the child and its welfare are served by the decree of adoption. Clerkin v. Geisendorfer, 137

       <p>
        In a valid adoption proceeding, the natural relationship of the parents is superseded by an artificial relationship, and courts should act with caution and circumspection in such proceedings, exerting every effort commensurate with the welfare of the child to prevail upon the natural parents to accept and fulfill their duties toward their child.

The abandonment determination is a question of fact best determined by the trial court, and the appellate court erred in holding, essentially as a matter of law, that father's filing of the parenting-time motions prior to the filing of the adoption petition precluded a finding of intent to abandon.

         Parent's incarceration.

        Incarceration is not a per se justification for failure to pay child support. The fact that a parent has been incarcerated for any or all of the 12-month period immediately preceding the filing of the petition is one factor to be considered by the court in making its determinations.

           The general assembly finds that there are a growing number of children in the legal custody of the county departments of human or social services who are the victims of physical or sexual abuse, neglect, or abandonment and who are awaiting permanent placement in safe, loving, and nurturing adoptive homes. The general assembly further finds that with the expedited permanency procedures that have been established and with the enactment of legislation implementing the federal "Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997", Pub.L. 105-89, it is anticipated that the number of children available for adoption will continue to increase dramatically and that there will be a corresponding increased need to identify statewide those families that are willing and qualified to adopt these needy children.
           (a) (I) The general assembly finds that there are a growing number of children in the legal custody of the county departments of human or social services who are the victims of physical or sexual abuse, neglect, or abandonment and who are awaiting permanent placement in safe, loving, and nurturing adoptive homes.

           The general assembly finds that, although the county departments of human or social services have made admirable efforts in assessing and reporting on the qualifications of families interested in adopting, there is a need to make the valuable resource of such qualified families more available and accessible to all counties in the state in order to satisfy the growing need for suitable adoptive families.

         Accordingly, the general assembly determines that it is appropriate and desirable for the state department to aid the county departments of human or social services in their efforts to achieve permanency for children in their legal custody who are available for adoption by making accessible to such county departments a statewide adoptive family resource registry of families who are qualified for and desirous of adopting children with special needs. Toward that end, the general assembly further determines that it would be beneficial to such children and families for the state department to develop an approved vendor list of qualified home study providers by region, standardized investigation criteria, and minimum uniform adoptive home study report standards in order to achieve more timely adoptive placements, to reduce the burden associated with the adoption process, and to avert the possibility of failed adoptions.

         Definition of adoption.
        </b>
        Adoption has been defined as the act by which relations of paternity and affiliation are recognized as legally existing between persons not so related by nature. Graham v. Francis, 83
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 346
        </cite>
        , 265 P. 690 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Adoption, in legal contemplation, is an act by which the parties thereto establish the relationship of parent and child between persons not so related by nature, and which, in many respects, severs the natural relations existing between the child and its parents, although in a narrower sense it is restricted to the act of the person taking the child. Johnson v. Black, 137

        <b>
         Change of custody follows from valid adoption decree.
        </b>
        One of the legal effects of an adoption is to divest the natural parents of their custodial rights and to grant such rights to the adoptive parents. This change of custody follows as a natural consequence of a valid adoption decree. Johnson v. Black, 137
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 119

        The adoption statute deprives the natural parents of their rights and obligations to their natural children after adoption. People v. Estate of Murphy, 29

        the father was denied his constitutional due process rights. Therefore, the adoption decrees that were made assuming that both mother's and father's parental rights had been properly terminated were void. Accordingly, the adoptive parents could not be considered to have the full liberty interest in the children that they would have if the adoption decrees were valid. M.C. v. Adoption Choices of

         General rule as reflected in this section
        </b>
        is that an adoption decree terminates the parental rights and duties of child's natural parents and grants those rights and duties to adoptive parents. Singular exception to general rule as set forth in section applies only in cases when adopting parent is married to natural parent. Thus, express statements of limitation must be read to exclude from adoption statute's reach all other possible exceptions not listed. Adoption of T.K.J., 931 P.2d 488 (Colo. App. 1996).

        After adoption the adopted child becomes the heir of his adoptive parents as though born to them in lawful wedlock, and his natural parents are cut off and neither they nor their lineage may inherit from the adopted child. As to his adoptive parents, the child becomes subject to all rights and obligations of a child born in lawful wedlock. The relation thus established can be nothing less than that of parent and child. To say that such status is less or different from the parent and child relationship would do violence to the clear legislative intent to create unity in the family. Wright v. Wysowatcky, 147

        An agreement not to disinherit is supported by the consideration of the acquirement by the adoptive parents of the child's love and affection, her filial obligations to them, a change in domestic relationship, the consent of the surviving natural parent to forever relinquish his paternal rights, and the child's forfeiture of her rights which she enjoyed before the adoption proceedings.

        Purpose of section.
       </b>
       This section serves the beneficial purpose of curing technical defects which do not affect the basic rights of the parties and guaranteeing to adopting parents the undisturbed relationship with the child, which was one of its legislative intents. White v. Davis, 163
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 122
       </cite>
       , 428 P.2d 909 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parties assuming the responsibilities of adoptive parents are entitled to assurance that upon adopting a child they are not also adopting a law suit. Smith v. Welfare Dept., 144
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 103

        Sufficiency of notice.
       </b>
       Where a father was serving in the Navy and had notice of a dependency proceeding, his right to contest adoption decrees is barred by this section which limits the right to challenge a valid decree to two years after entry. Olsen v. Davidson, 142
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 205
       </cite>
       , 350 P.2d 338 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the record reveals service by publication, where the adequacy or sufficiency of such notice was strongly challenged by motion to vacate which alleged that in support of an order authorizing service by publication the procurer of the order made a false representation that he was unaware of the whereabouts of the natural father, it was a proper matter for evidentiary hearing by the lower court to determine whether the due process requirements in the adoption proceedings were met. White v. Davis, 163
       <cite class="co_code">

        In termination of parental rights case,
       </b>
       omission of the process server's verified signature is insufficient to cause prejudice to father's case where father acknowledged he received the notices and petitions. Allowing an amendment to cure the defect serves the best interests of the children. In re Petition of Taylor, 134 P.3d 579 (Colo. App. 2006).

        Validity of consent.
       </b>
       Where the record is devoid of any evidence of fraud, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, or misconduct on the part of the adopting parents or their attorney, and there is nothing to indicate that the mother was lacking in understanding as to the consequences of her consent to the adoption of her children, a finding by the trial court that at the time of signing the consent the mother did not realize the seriousness and finality of her act was insufficient to set aside the decrees of adoption.

        No inherent right exists to rescind an adoption.

       When there is no provision made for the annulment of a valid decree of adoption, the right does not exist. In re S.D., 251 P.3d 1188 (Colo. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff who sought to rescind adoption after 35 years failed to bring an action to set aside the adoption within a reasonable time, barring the court from finding the adoption to be legally void. In re S.D., 251 P.3d 1188 (Colo. App. 2010).

The general assembly also finds that an adult adoptee, his biological or adoptive parent, or his biological sibling may desire to obtain information about each other at different points in time. Furthermore, the general assembly finds that confidentiality from the general public is essential to the adoption process and that any procedure to access information which relates to an adoption to search for unknown relatives through a confidential intermediary or a licensed child placement agency must be designed to maintain confidentiality and to respect the wishes of all involved parties.

On and after January 1, 2016, contact preference forms shall only address a birth parent's preferences regarding contact and the ability to submit an explanation for the stated contact preference and to submit or update medical history. A child placement agency is not liable to any person for the failure of a birth parent to submit a contact preference form to the state registrar. On and after July 1, 2014, the state registrar shall post a notice on the website of the office of the state registrar of vital statistics stating that the contact preference form will be revised to eliminate the option to authorize or object to the release of the original birth certificate and that birth parents may exercise this option prior to January 1, 2016.

If both birth parents have filed a contact preference form executed prior to January 1, 2016, stating a preference to authorize the release of the original birth certificate, then the state registrar must release the original birth certificate to the eligible party. If there is no contact preference form on file prior to January 1, 2016, from a birth parent named on the original birth certificate, or if a contact preference form executed prior to January 1, 2016, is on file that states a preference that the original birth certificate not be released, then the state registrar may not release the original birth certificate to the eligible party prior to January 1, 2016, unless the birth parent rescinds the contact preference form, upon mutual consent of two or more reunited parties, the birth parent is deceased, or the eligible party obtains a court order pursuant to section  19-1-309. When one birth parent has authorized the release of the birth certificate and the other birth parent has filed a contact preference form prior to January 1, 2016, not authorizing release, the state registrar shall issue the original birth certificate to the eligible party with the name of the nonconsenting parent redacted.

         The general assembly takes note that the law inColorado regarding access to adoption records has treated persons differently depending upon the law in effect upon the date of the adoption of the adoptee and that the statutory scheme has been confusing, complicated, and ambiguous. By repealing and reenacting provisions of this section to remove those varying time periods and varying levels of access or nonaccess to adoption records by an adult adoptee or by a birth parent, it is the intent of the general assembly that access to adoption records no longer be dependent upon the law in effect on the date of the finalization of adoption. The general assembly declares that the purpose of the revision of this subsection (2) is to make the access to adoption records by members of the adoption triad more uniform as outlined in this subsection (2). The general assembly further declares that it is the intent of the general assembly to not abrogate, limit, or change the holding in or affect any rights created under In re J.N.H., 209 P.3d 1221 (Colo. App. 2009) with respect to access by an adult adoptee to the names of his or her birth parents and to all court records and papers regarding the adoption of the adult adoptee.

A written statement specifying that a birth parent wishes the identifying information concerning that parent on file with a child placement agency to remain confidential must remain in the court's and the child placement agency's relinquishment or termination file unless later withdrawn by the parent or superceded by a consent form. A child placement agency is not liable to any individual for the failure of a birth parent to submit such a written statement to the court. In addition to such a statement, the birth parent may also submit to the court and to the child placement agency a letter of explanation that the court and the child placement agency must release to the adoptee at the time that the adoptee makes a request for inspection of the adoption records. This subparagraph (V) applies only to adoption records in the possession of child placement agencies and does not apply to adoption records in the possession of the court or any other agency, entity, or person.

      <li id="t19-ar07-p02-s19-7-202ol11">
       The general assembly finds and declares that it is beneficial for a youth placed in foster care to be able to continue relationships with the youth's siblings, regardless of age, so that siblings may share their strengths and association in their everyday and often common experiences.
      </li>
      <li id="t19-ar07-p02-s19-7-202ol12">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that it is the responsibility of all adults involved in a youth's life, including but not limited to county departments, parents, foster parents, guardians ad litem, court-appointed special advocates, next of kin, treatment providers, and others, to seek opportunities to foster those sibling relationships to promote continuity and help to sustain family relationships.
      </li>
      <li id="t19-ar07-p02-s19-7-202ol13">
       Because the number of family foster homes in Colorado is often insufficient to meet the needs of youth, including sibling groups, it is, therefore, Colorado's goal to continue to recruit foster families and build resources sufficient to meet this need.

In determining whether a requested visit would be in the best interests of one or both of the siblings, the county department shall ascertain whether there is pending in any jurisdiction a criminal action in which either of the siblings is either a victim or a witness. If such a criminal action is pending, the county department, before arranging any visit between the siblings, shall consult with the district attorney for the jurisdiction in which the criminal action is pending to determine whether the requested visit may have a detrimental effect upon the prosecution of the pending criminal action.
