       A transfer of exclusive jurisdiction rests upon a grant by the state, through consent or cession, and it follows in accordance with familiar principles applicable to grants,
       
       that the grant may be accepted or declined. People v. Sullivan, 151

       Therefore the mere fact that the United States needs and acquires property within a state's boundaries does not necessitate the assumption by the government
       
       of the burdens incident to an exclusive jurisdiction by acceptance of the state's grant thereof. People v. Sullivan, 151

       The terms of a cession, to the extent that they may lawfully be prescribed, that is, consistently with the carrying out of the purpose of the acquisition,
       
       determine the extent of the federal jurisdiction. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Donoho, 144

       Formerly it was held that acceptance of the cession by the United States was evidenced by its purchase of the land
       
       or the performance of other acts manifesting its intention to accept the jurisdiction ceded. People v. Sullivan, 151

       The land purchased with consent of the state ipso facto

       In conformity with the rule that the government has power to accept exclusive jurisdiction or less, congress, in order to create a definite method of acceptance
       
       of jurisdiction so that all persons could know whether, as to particular property, the government had obtained no jurisdiction at all, or partial jurisdiction, or exclusive jurisdiction, enacted a law providing that United States agencies and authorities may accept exclusive jurisdiction of lands acquired by the United States by filing a notice with the Governor of the state, and that unless and until that is done, it shall be conclusively presumed that no such jurisdiction has been accepted.

       The lack of federal responsibility within federal enclaves resulted in recognition at a relatively early time of the doctrine
       
       that the state law in force at the time of cession or purchase continues in full force so as to determine private rights within the territory and thus fill the vacuum which would otherwise exist. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Donoho, 144

       Generally in order to deprive state courts of criminal jurisdiction over lands ceded to the United States
       
       there must be a surrender of jurisdiction by the state and an acceptance by the United States. People v. Sullivan, 151

       Where the federal government has not given notice of acceptance of jurisdiction over land acquired by it in a state,
       
       the federal courts are without jurisdiction of prosecution for an alleged crime committed therein although a state statute authorizes the United States to take jurisdiction. People v. Sullivan, 151

       At least the United States is without exclusive jurisdiction over the offense,

       Where on the date an offense was allegedly committed the United States had acquired title to state property but nothing in record

       Since exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United States over a military reservation does not operate
       
       as an absolute prohibition against state laws, it does not operate to prohibit the payment of relief benefits to a resident of such reservation. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Donoho, 144

       It seems that state laws passed for the public welfare should be applied to federal enclaves within the state,

       The deed ceding land to the United States for a military post later called Fort Logan

       The deed went beyond the language of this section in that it contained an additional provision
       
       that any property on the post should remain released and exempt from all tollages, taxes and assessments of every name and nature for and during the time the United States shall remain the owner thereof. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Donoho, 144

       In view of the fact that "exclusive legislative" jurisdiction does not operate as an absolute prohibition against state
       
       laws but has for its purpose protection of federal sovereignty, the Supreme Court concludes that it does not operate to prohibit the payment of relief under §

       in the light of the geographical location of the federal enclave, Fort Logan. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Donoho, 144

       The conferring of a benefit required by federal law cannot be construed

       Indeed by paying relief in these circumstances, the federal policy to recognize citizens of the United States
