Upon the inclusion of any county or municipality in the authority so created, either initially or as an additional member later, all rights, contracts, obligations, and property, both real and personal, of such municipality or county used for or in relation to transportation by air shall vest in the authority created pursuant to this section, unless otherwise specifically provided by the resolution including such municipality or county in the authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t41a03s41-3-104ol13">
       Any combination formed to create an authority may be decreased if each of the members then included therein and the board of the authority consent to the decrease and make provision for the retention or disposition of the assets and liabilities of the county or municipality, as the case may be; but, if the authority has any bonds outstanding, no such decrease shall be effective until at least seventy-five percent of the holders of the outstanding bonds of the authority consent thereto in writing, or unless the board determines that such decrease will not affect adversely the rights of the holders of such outstanding bonds.

       A municipality or a county in this state shall not adopt a resolution authorized by this section without a public hearing thereon.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, the general assembly may, by law, authorize the governor, on behalf of the state, to join in the creation of any airport authority authorized by this article or to join any existing airport authority created pursuant to this article.

       All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon any authority organized pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be exercised and performed by and through the board except as otherwise provided by law; but the exercise of any and all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers may be by said board delegated and redelegated to any of the officers created or by the board acting under this article.
      </li>
      <li id="t41a03s41-3-105ol12">
       The board of commissioners of an authority created by the formation of a combination shall consist of at least five members, but no more than nine members, representing the counties or municipalities participating in the combination. The authorizing resolution, filed with the director of the division of local government in the department of local affairs, as provided in section 41-3-104 (1), shall contain a provision as to the representation of the counties and municipalities participating in the combination. The members of the board of an authority created by a combination shall be appointed by resolution of the governing boards of the counties or municipalities that are members of the combination, the initial appointments, at the election of such municipality or county, to be made by the authorizing resolution filed with the director of said division. If the county in which the airport is to be located is not a member of the combination, then the member or members, if any, to which such county is entitled shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners of such county. The board created by the independent action of a county shall consist of five members who shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners of the county, and initial appointments to such board, at the election of the board of county commissioners, may be made in the authorizing resolution filed with the director of said division. Board members from municipalities and counties in this state shall be taxpaying electors, as defined in section 1-1-104 (49), C.R.S., at the time of their appointment, residing in the municipality or county from which appointed. After an authority is organized by the formation of a combination, the inclusion of additional counties or municipalities shall entitle the included municipalities or counties to representation on the same basis as other counties or municipalities. Each member of the board may receive as compensation for his or her services a sum not in excess of sixty dollars per year. No member of the board shall receive any compensation as an employee of the authority or otherwise, other than that provided in this section, and no member of the board shall be interested in any contract or transaction with the authority except in his or her official respective capacity.
      </li>
      <li id="t41a03s41-3-105ol13">
       The term of each member shall be for four years; except that the terms of the members of the first board shall be adjusted so that the terms of one-half of the members shall expire two years thereafter. At the first meeting of the board of a newly formed authority the commissioners shall determine by lot which members shall serve for two-year terms and which shall serve for four-year terms. At the expiration of the term of any commissioner, a new appointment shall be made by the appropriate governing board, and any member may be appointed to succeed himself.
      </li>
      <li id="t41a03s41-3-105ol14">
       A change of residence of a member of the board from a municipality or county in the state to a place outside the municipality that he or she represents, or the county from which he or she is appointed, automatically creates a vacancy on the board as to such municipality or county. Vacancies which may occur on the board through death or resignation of one of the members, or for any other reason, shall be filled in the same manner as provided for the appointment of original members of the board.
      </li>

Notice of time and place designated for all regular meetings shall be posted in at least three places within each municipality and county forming a part of the authority if created by the formation of a combination, and, in addition, one such notice shall be posted, irrespective of the procedure under which the authority is created, in the county courthouse in the county wherein the airport is located and in the county creating the authority. Such notices shall remain posted and shall be changed in the event that the time or place of such regular meeting is changed. Special meetings may be called by any officer or member of the board by informing the other members of the date, time, and place of such meeting and the purpose for which it is called, and by posting as provided in this paragraph (a) at least three days previous to said meeting. All business of the board shall be conducted only during such regular or special meetings, and all of such meetings shall be open to the public.

The procedures above described shall be subject to the approval of the board of county commissioners of any county independently creating an authority under the provisions of this article, and any action on the part of the board to raise or increase revenue from any source whatsoever for the purposes of the authority shall also be subject to such approval.

       rather than by its label. Fees charged for use of public facility owned by municipal corporation are not taxes if purpose is to defray expenses for operating and improving facility and if fees are only imposed on users of facility. Taxes are not based on amount of use and the proceeds thereof are used to defray general municipal expenses. Westrac, Inc. v. Walker Field, 812 P.2d 714 (Colo. App. 1991).

       <b>
        Since this section does not impose requirement of reasonableness for imposition of fees by airport authorities,
       </b>
       such authorities have broad discretion regarding imposition of such fees which is subject only to constitutional and federal statutory limitations. Absent any express statutory limitations, judicial deference will be given to the sound discretion of airport authority imposing such fees. Westrac, Inc. v. Walker Field, 812 P.2d 714 (Colo.

        Operation of airport is governmental function.
       </b>
       A city, in voluntarily assuming a power and exercising a function for the benefit of the municipality and extending aid toward the promotion and accommodation of air commerce and travel, did so in its municipal or proprietary capacity as distinguished from a governmental function assigned to it to enforce the general policy of the state in the administration of general laws. However, if the operation of the municipal airport by the city is in keeping with the declared policy of the general assembly to be a governmental function, then the power of the city to act for the purpose of the promotion and convenience of travel by air is further amplified, instead of restricted, by this section.

       City elected to provide certain necessary services and supplies by leasing portions of the airport to a fixed base operator, which would in turn provide those supplies and services to the airport users. The operation of the airport with respect to such essential functions is not for the particular benefit of the citizens of the municipality, but, rather, for the public good in general. Under these circumstances, the city was operating in its governmental capacity. Cherry Creek Aviation v. City of Steamboat Springs, 958 P.2d 511 (Colo. App. 1998).
