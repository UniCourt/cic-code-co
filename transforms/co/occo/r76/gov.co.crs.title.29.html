         All statutory tax levies for collection in 1989 and thereafter when applied to the total valuation for assessment of the state, each of the counties, cities, and towns not chartered as home rule except as provided in this subsection (1), and each of the fire, sanitation, irrigation, drainage, conservancy, and other special districts established by law shall be so reduced as to prohibit the levying of a greater amount of revenue than was levied in the preceding year plus five and one-half percent plus the amount of revenue abated or refunded by the taxing entity by August 1 of the current year less the amount of revenue received by the taxing entity by August 1 of the current year as taxes paid on any taxable property that had previously been omitted from the assessment roll of any year, except to provide for the payment of bonds and interest thereon, for the payment of any contractual obligation that has been approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the taxing entity, for the payment of expenses incurred in the reappraisal of classes or subclasses ordered by or conducted by the state board of equalization, for the payment to the state of excess state equalization payments to school districts which excess is due to the undervaluation of taxable property, or for the payment of capital expenditures as provided in subsection (1.2) of this section. For purposes of this subsection (1), the amount of revenues received as taxes paid on any taxable property that had been previously omitted from the assessment roll shall not include the amount of such revenues received as taxes paid on oil and gas leaseholds and lands that had been previously omitted from the assessment roll due to underreporting of the selling price or the quantity of oil or gas sold therefrom. In computing the limit, the following shall be excluded: The increased valuation for assessment attributable to annexation or inclusion of additional land, the improvements thereon, and personal property connected therewith within the taxing entity for the preceding year; the increased valuation for assessment attributable to new construction and personal property connected therewith, as defined by the property tax administrator in manuals prepared pursuant to section  39-2-109 (1)(e), C.R.S., within the taxing entity for the preceding year; the increased valuation for assessment attributable to increased volume of production for the preceding year by a producing mine if said mine is wholly or partially within the taxing entity and if said increase in volume of production causes an increase in the level of services provided by the taxing entity; and the increased valuation for assessment attributable to previously legally exempt federal property which becomes taxable if such property causes an increase in the level of services provided by the taxing entity.

In that event, said division shall notify the governing body of each municipality in the county of the request and of the period of time, not less than twenty days, during which the division will receive comment on the request. In considering whether to waive application of said section  43-2-202 (2), C.R.S., the division shall consider, among other relevant matters, the benefit of the project or asset to the municipalities in the county, the need for the project or asset, and alternative methods of and timing for financing the project or asset. No approval for such waiver shall be granted or continued until the division determines that the property tax revenues in the road and bridge fund, excluding the revenues from such increased levy, for the year for which the increase is imposed bear at least the same proportion to all countywide property tax revenues as in the immediate prior year budget.

The advertisement specified in this paragraph (c) shall be in a newspaper published within the taxing entity, and, if there is no newspaper published within the taxing entity, then by publication in a newspaper published within the county which has general circulation within the taxing entity and shall appear twice therein. The second such appearance shall not be more than eight days prior to the date upon which the public hearing is to be held. The advertisement shall be no less than one-quarter page in size and shall have a caption in capital letters in a type no smaller than twenty-four-point stating “a public hearing shall be held to consider increasing your property taxes for capital expenditures”. Such advertisement shall be in a type no smaller than eighteen-point and shall not be placed in that portion of the newspaper in which legal notices and classified advertisements appear. Such advertisement shall state that such board will hold a public hearing, at a time and place fixed in the advertisement, and the purpose of such hearing and shall apprise the general public of its right to attend the hearing and make comments regarding the proposed matter. Such advertisement shall also state what the property taxes would be without such excess and what the property taxes will be with such excess and the percentage difference between such property taxes. Any public hearing held pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be open to the general public. An opportunity shall be provided for all persons to present oral testimony within such reasonable time limits as shall be set by the board conducting the hearing. Prior to the conclusion of the public hearing, the governing board of the taxing entity shall publicly announce the percent by which the mill levy required to raise such excess exceeds the mill levy computed without such excess.

The limitation shall be applied to such aggregate property tax revenues. However, such aggregate amount shall not include any property tax revenue which is raised by or on behalf of a district, authority, or area which is within but is not comprised of the entire taxing entity and which is raised by a tax upon only property within such district, authority, or area; such property tax revenue is subject to a limitation independent of the limitation which is applied to the taxing entity within which such district, authority, or area is located.

Where bonds, contractual obligations, or capital expenditures have been approved, but actual revenues required for such purposes are not known at the time the levy is set, the taxing entity may base its levy on the estimated revenues which are so required for one year only and in subsequent years the levy shall be based on the actual revenues which are so required.

       If the board of any special district authorized to levy a tax or any officer charged with the duty of levying a tax in any special district is of the opinion that the amount of tax limited by section  29-1-301 will be insufficient for the needs of such special district for the current year, the question of an increased levy may be submitted to the division of local government in the department of local affairs, and it is the duty of said division to consider the public awareness of the question, the public support therefor, and the public objection thereto and to examine the needs of such special district and ascertain from such examination the financial condition thereof, and, if in the opinion of the division such special district is in need of additional funds, the said division may grant an increased levy for such special district above the limits specified in this part 3, and such special district is authorized to make such excess levy. The division of local government shall not under any circumstance grant an increased levy based upon increased valuation for assessment purposes from reappraisals. As used in this section, “special district” means any district organized pursuant to law, except school districts operating pursuant to title 22, C.R.S., which is authorized to levy an ad valorem tax on property within its boundaries, and the term includes, but is not limited to, districts organized under article 20 of title 30, C.R.S., articles 25 and 35 of title 31, C.R.S., and titles 32 and 37, C.R.S.

          The general assembly recognizes the need for periodic increased levies in order to finance capital projects and purchases of capital assets which are a one-time, nonrecurring expenditure. It is the intent of the general assembly that the division of local government may grant an increased levy for such expenditures if, in its opinion, a special district, to which section  29-1-301 (1.2)(a) does not apply, is in need of additional funds for such expenditures. Any increased levy granted by the division of local government in a given year which is designated by it as a capital expenditure shall not be included in determining the limitation in the following year. If the division is of the opinion that such additional funds will be needed for two or more years after reviewing the long-range plan of the special district concerning the expenditure of such funds, it may grant an increased levy, and such increased levy shall automatically be allowed for each year during which such additional funds will be needed. During such years, the increased levy for each year shall not be included in determining the limitation in the following year.

If the deficiencies are not corrected within ninety days from the date of the statement of deficiencies or within twelve months after the end of the fiscal year of the local government, whichever is later, the state auditor shall proceed in the same manner as provided in section  29-1-606 (5) as though no report had been filed.

      The general assembly hereby declares that the procedures for procurement by local government of construction projects which will be funded in whole or in part by the state through the highway users tax fund is a matter of statewide concern; that the identification and widespread publication of such projects will increase the competition for such projects leading to a decreased cost to taxpayers throughout the state; that increased privatization of such projects by local governments will aid in the development and retention of local small businesses, industries, and construction firms, will broaden the economic base of local areas, and will contribute to increased economic vitality throughout the state; and that the provisions of this part 7 are enacted in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety, and welfare of the people of this state.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and determines that statewide standards governing accountability for land development charges imposed by local governments to finance capital facilities and services are necessary and desirable to ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and fairness in the use to which moneys generated by such charges are put and to promote public confidence in local government finance. The general assembly therefore declares that this part 8 is a matter of statewide concern.

           Access to the internet insures access to information and government services, therefore, it is crucial that all people living in Colorado have equal access to the internet regardless of economic standing, educational background, or location. It is in the state’s interest to ensure that local governments do not impose taxes on internet access, as such local taxation would inhibit equal access to the internet and the accessibility of online services for the people living in any local jurisdiction that imposes an internet access tax.
          </li>
          <li id="t29-generalprovisions-ar01-p10-s29-1-1001ol14aII">
           Any tax on internet access imposed by a local government would present unique administrative challenges for the internet service providers required to collect that tax. Such issues include, but are not limited to, tracking which local governments impose a tax, ascertaining the location of every customer, and determining the customers from which a tax must be collected. These logistical concerns may result in an internet service provider refusing to offer service to customers living in local jurisdictions that impose a tax on internet access, thus reducing competition and disenfranchising certain localities from affordable online services.
          </li>
          <li id="t29-generalprovisions-ar01-p10-s29-1-1001ol14aIII">
           The promotion of economic development is of the utmost importance for Colorado. To foster the state’s economic growth, Colorado strives to become a center for electronic commerce and taxing internet access on the state or local level would impede that goal.

      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the imposition of restrictions by a local government upon when or how often individuals may meet upon private residential property to pray, worship, or otherwise study or discuss issues relating to religious beliefs infringes upon the fundamental right to the free exercise of religion. The general assembly further finds and declares that such restrictions are of significant interest to people living outside the jurisdiction of the local government. In addition, the ability of individuals to freely determine when and how often they wish to meet for such purposes should be uniform throughout the state. Accordingly, the general assembly finds that restrictions that specifically limit when or how often individuals may meet upon private residential property to pray, worship, or otherwise study or discuss issues relating to religious beliefs are a matter of statewide concern and the provisions of this section shall preempt any provisions of any local government ordinance, resolution, regulation, or other restriction to the contrary.

       State’s interest in uniformity does not outweigh the home rule city’s interest in preventing tax avoidance.
       Where a home rule city’s excise tax is intended to collect only the difference between what it would have collected in sales tax had the purchase been made locally and any sales or use tax previously paid to another municipality, the state’s interest in uniformity does not outweigh the home rule city’s interest in preventing tax avoidance by purchasing outside of the city limits.

       Party claiming that administrative methods for challenging municipal sales and use tax as set forth in municipal code were unconstitutional and conflicted with provisions of this section
       is not required to exhaust all administrative remedies prior to seeking declaratory judgment on issue. Fred Schmid Appliance & Tel. v. Denver, 811 P.2d 31 (Colo. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A local government cannot undercut or supplant the right to judicial review afforded by this section
       by precluding de novo review. Service Merch. Co., Inc. v. Schwartzberg, 971 P.2d 654 (Colo. App. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (9), a local government that enacts an alternative avenue for appeals of sales and use tax assessments must comply with the procedure it creates for such appeals.
       Where a local government has created a sales or use tax assessment appeals process that requires a taxpayer to obtain a final decision rendered after a hearing as a prerequisite to an appeal, the local government may not deprive the taxpayer of the right to an appeal by refusing to hold a hearing and issue a final decision. Asphalt Specialties, Co. v. City of Commerce City, 218 P.3d 741 (Colo. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeals taken from locally imposed use or sales taxes are a matter of statewide concern, and therefore subject to the appellate procedures of this section rather than the appellate procedures of local rules.
       Walgreen Co. v. Charnes, 819 P.2d 1039 (Colo. 1991).
      </p>

       General assembly has determined the need for a statewide uniform process
       to avoid inconsistent treatment of taxpayers and confusing and conflicting remedies. MDC Holdings, Inc. v. Town of Parker, 223 P.3d 710 (Colo. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section supersedes municipal code
       that requires an additional formal hearing. The section contains its own controlling prescription for “exhaustion of local remedies” that defines and controls the appellate process in local sales and use tax appeals. MDC Holdings, Inc. v. Town of Parker, 223 P.3d 710 (Colo. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       In appeal involving challenge to sales and use tax provisions of municipal code,
       appropriate remedy on appeal is not to remand to district court for de novo review under this section since taxpayer pursued review under municipal code. Arapahoe Roofing & Sheet Metal v. Denver, 831 P.2d 451 (Colo. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenge of sufficiency of notice of assessment issued pursuant to this section
       is moot issue when taxpayer failed to timely file petition for hearing to challenge sufficiency. Am. Drug Store v. Denver, 831 P.2d 465 (Colo. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxpayer could appeal after 90-day wait period under section
       because the local government had no provisions for making a final decision following an informal hearing. MDC Holdings, Inc. v. Town of Parker, 223 P.3d 710 (Colo. 2010).

       ANNOTATION
      </h4>
      <p>
       Municipal ordinance creating a lien for the collection of its sales taxes that is superior to a lien held by a bank was a proper exercise of the municipality’s authority under § 6 of article XX of the state constitution and especially § 6(g).
       The priority of local liens for unpaid sales taxes, at least with respect to their superiority over private commercial liens, is a local and municipal concern for which the municipality may legislate, even if such legislation were to conflict with a state statute. Given that the levy and collection of a local sales tax by a home-rule municipality is a local and municipal concern, it would be anomalous to conclude that, while the general assembly may grant priority to the sales tax liens of statutory cities and towns, a home rule municipality may not makes its sales tax lien superior to the commercial lien of a private lender. Town of Avon v. Weststar Bank, 151 P.3d 601 (Colo. App. 2006).

         The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the special sales tax recognized in this section permits counties and statutory municipalities to enact an additional tax specific to the sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products, subject to voter approval. This distinct taxing authority is in addition to the statutory authority for counties and statutory municipalities to impose a general sales tax, while home rule municipalities derive all sales taxing authority from the home rule authority granted by the Colorado constitution.

       This section does not contravene § 1 of art. XI, Colo. Const.

      </p>
      <p>
       Revenue bond financing, as authorized by this section, does not constitute the pledging of credit for a private corporation and does not subject the county to the debt, contract, and liability of a private corporation in contravention of § 1 of art. XI, Colo. Const.Allardice v. Adams County, 173

      </p>
      <p>
       Nor § 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const.
       Revenue bond financing authorized by this statute does not unlawfully create county debt without the required election and for unauthorized purposes in contravention of § 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const.Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133

       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is no pledge of the credit of the county for the payment of revenue bonds, no “debt” is thereby created, and, consequently, the issuance of such bonds has no effect whatsoever on the debt limitations prescribed in § 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const.Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">

       The provisions of this section do not contain delegations of power in contravention of § 35 of art. V, Colo. Const., and § 8 of art. XIV, Colo. Const.
       Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       Not violative of substantive due process.
       The revenue bond financing authorized by this section serves a bona fide public purpose and thereby does not deprive taxpayers of substantive due process of law in contravention of § 25 of art. II, Colo. Const., and of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument under the “due process” clauses of the state and federal constitutional provisions that the revenue bond financing authorized by this statute favors one private enterprise over another engaged, or wishing to engage, in the same business in the same locality (in short, that the financing is for the private benefit of a private enterprise); that there is no assurance a competitor would receive the same consideration; and consequently that the project is not for a public purpose is without merit. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Public project not necessarily municipal.
       The fact that project financed by revenue bonds is for a “public purpose” does not necessarily make its existence or its function municipal in nature. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       But its effect may fulfill public purpose.
       It is the effect of, or the benefits flowing from, the completed project and its operation by private enterprise that fulfills the “public purpose” requirement and not, “per se”, the county’s participation therein. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mechanics of securing obligations are constitutionally immaterial.
       Since revenue bonds do not create a “debt” within the meaning of that term as used in § 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const., the mechanics of securing the obligations of those who advance the funds for the project are constitutionally immaterial. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Colorado law, public revenue bonds do not create debt,
       if there is no pledge of public property. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       No monetary liability of county.
       A county is not authorized to, and could not under the law, use general county funds, nor is it in any manner responsible for any shortages or deficiencies which may occur as the result of the development or the operation of the project financed with revenue bonds. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchaser on notice as to no such liability.
       If a bond purchaser sees fit to purchase revenue bonds of a project for the sake of a federal tax advantage, he certainly will be on notice of the fact that there will never be any pecuniary liability against the city, and that he will be able to look only to the revenues of the project and the project property itself for payment of his bonds. With it expressed clearly in the law and on the face of each bond that neither the credit nor taxing power of the municipality is pledged, no bondholder will ever be heard to say he was deceived or that he thought otherwise. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133
       </cite>
       , 476 P.2d 982 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The participation of a county as a “lessor” under this section does not constitute a “municipal function”.
       Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 133

      </p>
      <p>
       Validity sustained by weight of authority.
       The employment of public revenue bonds to foster the promotion of local industry is not a new concept, and the weight of authority sustains the validity of laws such as this statute. Allardice v. Adams County, 173
       <cite class="co_code">

       Any bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this article and at any time outstanding may be refunded at any time and from time to time by a county or municipality by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the governing body may determine to refund the principal of the bonds to be so refunded, all accrued and unaccrued interest thereon to the normal maturity dates of such bonds or to the prior redemption dates selected by the county or municipality in accordance with the proceedings under which the bonds to be refunded were issued, including any mortgage or trust indenture given to secure the same, and any premiums and incidental expenses necessary to be paid in connection therewith. The principal amount of any such refunding bonds may be equal to, less than, or greater than the principal amount of the bonds to be so refunded. The net effective interest rate on any such refunding bonds may be equal to, less than, or greater than the net effective interest rate on the bonds to be so refunded.

      <li id="t29-generalprovisions-ar03-s29-3-116ol12">
       Any such refunding may be effected, whether the bonds to be refunded have matured or shall mature thereafter, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof, directly or indirectly, to the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby or by exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby, but the holders of any bonds to be so refunded shall not be compelled, without their consent, to surrender their bonds for payment or exchange prior to the date on which they are payable at normal maturity date or prior redemption date selected by the county or municipality in accordance with the proceedings under which the bonds to be refunded were issued, including any mortgage or trust indenture given to secure the same.

       The proceeds of the refunding bonds shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the bonds to be so refunded or be placed in escrow in any state or national bank within or without this state which possesses and is exercising trust powers to be applied to the payment of the bonds being refunded or the refunding bonds or both upon their presentation therefor, to the extent, in such priority, and otherwise in the manner in which the county or municipality may determine. Except to the extent expressly inconsistent with the provisions of this article, the proceedings under which the bonds to be so refunded were issued, including any mortgage or trust indenture given to secure the same, shall govern the issuance of such refunding bonds, the establishment of any escrow in connection therewith, and the investment and reinvestment of any escrowed proceeds.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-generalprovisions-ar03-s29-3-116ol14">
       All refunding bonds issued under authority of this article shall be payable solely from revenues out of which the bonds to be refunded thereby are payable or from revenues out of which bonds of the same character may be made payable under this article or any other law in effect at the time of the refunding or from the escrowed proceeds of such refunding bonds, including any proceeds realized from the investment and reinvestment of such escrowed proceeds.

A tax sufficient to pay, when due, such principal and such interest shall be levied annually and assessed, collected, and paid in like manner with the other taxes of such city and shall be in addition to and exclusive of the maximum of all other taxes which such city is authorized or required by law to levy and assess upon the property subject to taxation.

When for any reason all or any part of the principal of or interest on any bonds payable from or additionally secured by taxes and issued by any city pursuant to this part 1 is paid when due, there shall be levied and assessed by the county clerk and collected by the proper collecting officers a tax sufficient to pay the same.

         That unsanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations exist in various cities and that such unsafe or unsanitary conditions arise from overcrowding and concentration of population, the obsolete and poor condition of buildings, improper planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper light, air, and space, unsanitary design and arrangement, lack of proper sanitary facilities, and the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other causes;

         That in all such cities persons of low income are forced to reside in unsanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations; that in various cities there is a lack of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available to all the inhabitants thereof and that consequently persons of low income are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations;

     Petition for creation of authority - notice - hearing.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol11">
       Any twenty-five residents of the city may file a petition with the city clerk setting forth that there is a need for an authority to function in the city. Upon the filing of such a petition, the city clerk shall give notice of the time, place, and purposes of a public hearing at which the council will determine the need for such an authority in the city. Such notice shall be given at the city’s expense by publishing a notice, at least ten days preceding the day on which the hearing is to be held, in a newspaper having a general circulation in the city, or, if there is no such newspaper, by posting such a notice in at least three public places within the city at least ten days preceding the day on which the hearing is to be held.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol12">
       Upon the date fixed for said hearing, held upon notice as provided in this section, a full opportunity to be heard shall be granted to all residents and taxpayers of the city and to all other interested persons. After such a hearing, the council shall determine:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol12a">
         Whether unsanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in the city; or
        </li>
        <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol12b">
         Whether there is a lack of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in the city available for all the inhabitants thereof.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol13">
       In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or unsanitary, the council shall take into consideration the following: The physical condition and age of the buildings; the degree of overcrowding; the percentage of land coverage; the light and air available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations; the size and arrangement of the rooms; the sanitary facilities; and the extent to which conditions exist in such buildings which endanger life or property by fire.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol14">
       If it determines that either of the conditions enumerated in subsection (2) of this section exist, the council shall adopt a resolution so finding and shall cause notice of such determination to be given to the mayor or such other appointing authority as is otherwise provided by charter or ordinance who shall thereupon appoint, as provided in section  29-4-205, no more than nine commissioners to act as an authority; except that, in any city and county having a population of more than three hundred thousand, the mayor or such other appointing authority as is otherwise provided by charter or ordinance shall appoint nine commissioners to act as an authority whose appointments shall be conditioned upon confirmation by the council. The number of commissioners shall be specified by the council in the resolution. A certificate signed by such commissioners shall then be filed with the division of local government in the department of local affairs and there remain of record, setting forth that a notice has been given and public hearing has been held, that the council made a determination after such hearing and that the mayor or such other appointing authority as is otherwise provided by charter or ordinance has appointed them as commissioners. Upon the filing of such certificates with said division, the commissioners and their successors shall constitute a housing authority, which shall be a body corporate and politic.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol15">
       The boundaries of such authority shall include the same geographical area as is then or thereafter included within the boundaries of the city which caused such authority to be created.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol16">
       If the council determines after a hearing that neither of the conditions enumerated in subsection (2) of this section exist, it shall adopt a resolution denying the petition. After three months have expired from the date of the denial of such petition, subsequent petitions may be filed and new hearings and determinations made thereon.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol17">
       In any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of any bond, contract, mortgage, trust indenture, or other agreement of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have been established in accordance with the provisions of this part 2 upon proof of the filing of the aforesaid certificate. A copy of such certificate, duly certified by the division of local government, shall be admissible in evidence in any such suit, action, or proceeding and shall be conclusive proof of the filing and contents thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p02-s29-4-204ol18">
       If the council of any city denies any petition filed for the creation of a housing authority, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (6) of this section, and the residents of such city determine that there is in fact a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations in the city, a petition may be filed with the council requesting that the question of the approval or disapproval of creating a housing authority be submitted to a vote of the registered electors of such city. If the petition, which may consist of one or more separate copies, contains the signatures and residence addresses of registered electors of such city equal in number to not less than five percent of the votes cast for governor or for president and vice-president of the United States at the last preceding general election held within such city, the council shall cause a special election to be held on the question of the creation of a housing authority. All registered electors within the city shall be eligible to vote at said election, which shall be conducted insofar as possible in accordance with the provisions of sections  29-4-604 to  29-4-607; except that the question to be voted on shall be the creation of a housing authority.

       The council may provide that all members of the governing body of the city shall ex officio be appointed the commissioners of the authority. The terms of office of such commissioners shall be coterminous with their terms of office on the governing body. For the purposes of this subsection (2), the term “governing body” means the mayor and council, board of trustees, board of commissioners, legislative body, or other body charged with governing the city. The mayor or, if the city has no mayor, the president of the council or such other presiding officer of the council shall ex officio be chairman of the commissioners. The commissioners shall select from among their members a vice-chairman.

         The council may provide that an authority shall consist of no more than nine commissioners appointed by the mayor or such other appointing authority as is otherwise provided by charter or ordinance; except that the council of a city and county having a population of more than three hundred thousand may provide that such authority shall consist of nine commissioners appointed by the mayor or such other appointing authority as is otherwise provided by charter or ordinance. The council may also provide that the mayor or such other appointing authority as is otherwise provided by charter or ordinance shall designate the first chairman. Not more than one of such commissioners may be a city official. In the event that a city official is appointed as a commissioner of an authority, acceptance or retention of such appointment shall not be deemed a forfeiture of his or her office, or incompatible therewith, or affect his or her tenure or compensation in any way. The term of office of a commissioner of an authority who is a city official shall not be affected or curtailed by the expiration of the term of his or her city office.

Thereafter, the term of office is the number of years as set by the council by resolution, not to exceed five years in length, or, if the council has not so acted, five years. A commissioner shall hold office until his or her successor has been appointed and has qualified. Vacancies other than by reason of expiration of terms shall be filled for the unexpired term. A majority of the commissioners constitutes a quorum. The mayor or such other appointing authority as is otherwise provided by charter or ordinance shall file with the city clerk a certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner, and such certificate is conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of each commissioner. The authority shall select from its members a vice-chairman and a chairman when the office of the first chairman becomes vacant.

This paragraph (c) shall apply to original and successor appointments and to appointments to fill vacancies.

          Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, commencing on and after August 2, 2000, as new appointments are made to authorities pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, such appointments shall be made so that not less than one commissioner of each authority shall be an individual who is directly assisted by the authority and who may, if provided in a plan of the authority, be elected by individuals directly assisted by the authority. This subsection (3.5) shall not apply to any authority with fewer than three hundred public housing units if the authority provides reasonable notice to the resident advisory board of the opportunity for not less than one individual to serve as a commissioner of the authority as provided in this subsection (3.5) and, within a reasonable time after receipt by such board of the notice, the authority is not notified of the intention of any such individual to serve as a commissioner.

         Except for the administrative fees collectible in connection with the inclusion of property within the boundaries of the Colorado new energy improvement district as authorized by section  29-4-226 (2), an authority is exempt from the payment of any taxes or fees to the state or any county, city and county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state. All property of an authority is exempt from all local and municipal taxes. Bonds, notes, debentures, and other evidences of indebtedness of an authority are declared to be issued for a public purpose and to be public instruments, and, together with interest thereon, are exempt from taxes. All property leased to an authority for the purposes of a project is also exempt from taxation, as is the income derived from the authority by the lessor under the lease.

The determination by an authority of the percentage of the project that qualifies for the exemptions from payment of property taxes and sales and use taxes may be made on the basis of either the relative square footage or cost and is presumed valid absent manifest error.

     Low rentals.

     <p>
      It is the purpose and intent of this part 2 to authorize and impose a duty on the authority to provide safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations at such rentals that persons of low income can afford to live in such dwelling accommodations. To this end, the authority from time to time shall reduce its rents and other charges for such dwelling accommodations to the extent that it deems such action expedient; but the authority shall not reduce its rents or other charges if such action is in violation of any contract between the authority and an obligee or would result in an insufficiency of revenues from the project to meet the costs of the operation and maintenance thereof, to meet all obligations of the authority as same mature, and to create reasonable reserves for such contingencies as the authority determines.

     Legislative declaration.
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is determined and declared that there exist within the state of Colorado substandard and unsanitary areas, occasioned by inadequate planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper light, air, and open space, defective design and arrangement of buildings, lack of proper sanitary facilities, and the existence of buildings, which, by reason of age, obsolescence, or physical deterioration, have become economic and social liabilities; that such conditions are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, and crime; and that such conditions impair the economic value of wide areas, infecting them with economic blight which results in inability to pay reasonable taxes. It is hereby declared that the remedying of such conditions is in the public interest, and this part 3 is enacted to provide means whereby said areas may be redeveloped by private enterprise with such assistance from public funds as may be furnished in accordance with the provisions of this part 3.

       Any twenty-five residents of the county may file a petition with the clerk of the board of county commissioners setting forth that there is a need for an authority to function in the county. Upon the filing of such petition, the clerk of the board shall give notice of the time, place, and purpose of a public hearing at which the board will determine the need for such an authority in the county. Such notice shall be given at the county’s expense by publishing a notice at least ten days preceding the day on which the hearing is to be held in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county or, if there is no newspaper, by posting such notice in at least three public places within the county at least ten days preceding the day on which the hearing is to be held.

      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p05-s29-4-503ol12">
       Upon the date fixed for said hearing, held upon notice as provided in this section, a full opportunity to be heard shall be granted to all residents and taxpayers of the county and to all other interested persons. After such a hearing, the board shall determine whether there is a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations in the county available to persons engaged in agricultural work, their families, and other low income families. If the board determines that such condition of shortage exists, the board shall adopt a resolution so finding and shall cause notice of such determination to be given to the chairman of the board, who shall thereupon appoint commissioners, as provided in either subsection (2) or (3) of section  29-4-504, to act as an authority. A certificate signed by such commissioners so appointed by the chairman of the board shall then be filed with the division of local government in the department of local affairs, and there remain of record, setting forth that a notice has been given and a public hearing has been held as aforesaid; that the board made a determination of such shortage after such hearing; and that the chairman of the board has appointed them as commissioners to act as an authority. Upon the filing of such certificate with said division, the commissioners and their successors shall constitute a housing authority, which shall be a body corporate and politic.

       If the board, after a hearing, determines that there is not a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations in the county available to persons engaged in agricultural work, to their families, and to other families of low income, it shall adopt a resolution denying the petition. After three months have expired from the denial of the petition, subsequent petitions may be filed and new hearings and determinations made thereon.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p05-s29-4-503ol14">
       In any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of any contract, mortgage, trust indenture, or other agreement of the authority or involving any action taken by the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have been established in accordance with the provisions of this part 5 upon proof of the filing of the aforesaid certificate. A copy of such certificate, duly certified by the director of the division of local government, shall be admissible in evidence in any such suit, action, or proceeding and shall be conclusive proof of the filing and the contents thereof.

       If the board of county commissioners denies any petition filed for the creation of a housing authority in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and the residents of such county determine that there is in fact a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations in the county, a petition may be filed with the board requesting that the question of the approval or disapproval of creating a housing authority be submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of such county. If the petition, which may consist of one or more separate copies, contains the signatures and residence addresses of qualified electors of such county equal in number to not less than five percent of the votes cast for governor or for president and vice president of the United States at the last preceding general election held within such county, the board shall cause the question of the creation of a housing authority to be submitted at the next general election. All registered electors within the county shall be eligible to vote on the question, which shall be conducted, insofar as possible, in accordance with the provisions of sections  29-4-604 to  29-4-607; except that the question to be voted on shall be the creation of a housing authority, and the provisions of the “Uniform Election Code of 1992” shall apply.

       Fact-finding under this section is legislative proceeding.
       The fact-finding function of the board of county commissioners’ proceeding under the county housing authority act is the exercise of a legislative directive and not a quasi-judicial proceeding. Smith v. Waymire, 29
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. App. 544, 487 P.2d 599
       </cite>
       (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       And not reviewable under rule 106, C.R.C.P.
       The fact-finding called for in this section is legislative and therefore not reviewable under rule 106, C.R.C.P., and since the board finds the facts but passes no judgment thereon, it is given no judicial power. Smith v. Waymire, 29
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. App. 544, 487 P.2d 599
       </cite>
       (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       For, when the people are given the right to accept or reject a police regulation, it is a legislative
       rather than a quasi-judicial or administrative power that it involved. Smith v. Waymire, 29
       <cite class="cocode">

     <ol>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p07-s29-4-702ol11">
       The general assembly finds and declares that there is a shortage in Colorado of decent, safe, and sanitary housing which is within the financial capabilities of low- and moderate-income families. In order to alleviate the high cost of construction loans and home mortgage interest costs for such families, the general assembly believes that it is essential that additional public moneys be made available, through the issuance of revenue bonds, to assist both private enterprise and governmental entities in meeting critical housing needs. The general assembly also finds and declares that the compelling need within the state for such assistance can best be met by the establishment of a quasi-governmental and corporate entity vested with the powers and duties specified in this part 7.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p07-s29-4-702ol12">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that many housing facilities occupied by low- and moderate-income families use excessive and unnecessary amounts of energy for heating and other home uses due to inadequate insulation or to the absence of other design features or materials which reduce total home energy requirements; that high costs impair the ability of such families to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing facilities; that many such facilities do not conform to building, housing maintenance, fire, health, or other state, county, or municipal codes or standards applicable to housing; that many such facilities are located in, and by their condition contribute to, deteriorating neighborhoods; that many such facilities are inadequate for the number of persons occupying them; that many such facilities cannot be repaired or improved within the financial capabilities of the low- or moderate-income owners or occupants; and that existing private and public means of enterprise and investment cannot provide financing or assistance on terms and conditions within the means of many such low- or moderate-income families. These conditions are adverse to the safety, health, and welfare of the citizens of this state and are contrary to the public policies of promoting the conservation of scarce energy resources, of minimizing the impact of higher costs on the ability of low- and moderate-income families to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing facilities, and of preventing and eliminating blight in urban and rural areas. The general assembly therefore further finds and declares that it is a valid public purpose to preserve and promote the safety, health, and welfare of the citizens of this state by the exercise of the powers specified in this part 7.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p07-s29-4-702ol13">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that there exists in this state a need to promote sound economic development, to maintain employment, and to encourage job opportunities in areas of unemployment and underemployment by assisting in the provision of facilities for business enterprises, including profit and nonprofit enterprises and particularly enterprises of small and moderate size, by assisting in the provision of capital to such business enterprises, and by otherwise supporting such business enterprises. The general assembly therefore finds and declares that it is a valid public purpose to preserve and promote the safety, health, and welfare of this state and its inhabitants by the exercise of the powers specified in this part 7 to finance the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, improvement, and equipping of facilities for business enterprises, including profit and nonprofit enterprises and particularly enterprises of small and moderate size, by private persons and political subdivisions of this state, to finance loans to and to make equity investments in such business enterprises for capital purposes, and to otherwise support such business enterprises.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p07-s29-4-702ol14">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that the purpose of this part 7 is to create the Colorado strategic seed fund to meet the special needs of entrepreneurs and small business operators in Colorado who would not otherwise be able to obtain funding for the development of ideas into viable and marketable products and services which would enhance the economic growth and development of Colorado, that this fund will be used to establish operating seed funds for investment in small businesses, and that this investment will, in turn, lead to further growth, diversification, and improvement of the Colorado economy.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p07-s29-4-702ol15">
       The general assembly further finds and declares:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p07-s29-4-702ol15a">
         That there exists a need to leverage private sector investment in new and innovative products, in entrepreneurial activity, and in economic development finance and that, therefore, state assistance for development finance should reflect a leveraging investment strategy; and
        </li>
        <li id="t29-housing-ar04-p07-s29-4-702ol15b">
         That the lending and investment of moneys to develop and improve the economy of the state requires specialized and unique knowledge, skill, and experience.

     Liability of peace officers.

      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p01-s29-5-111ol11">
       Notwithstanding the doctrines of sovereign immunity and respondeat superior, a city, town, county, or city and county or other political subdivision of the state or a state institution of higher education employing peace officers in accordance with article 7.5 of title 24, C.R.S., shall indemnify its paid peace officers and reserve officers, as defined in section  16-2.5-110, C.R.S., while the peace officers and reserve officers are on duty for any liability incurred by them and for any judgment, except a judgment for exemplary damages, entered against them for torts committed within the scope of their employment if the person claiming damages serves the political subdivision or state institution of higher education with a copy of the summons within ten days from the date when a copy of the summons is served on the peace officer or reserve officer. In no event shall any political subdivision or state institution of higher education be required so to indemnify its peace officers in excess of one hundred thousand dollars for one person in any single occurrence or three hundred thousand dollars for two or more persons for any single occurrence; except that in such instance no indemnity shall be allowed for any person in excess of one hundred thousand dollars. It is the duty of the city, town, county, city and county, or other political subdivision and of the state institution of higher education to provide the defense handled by the legal staff of the public entity or by other counsel, in the discretion of the public entity, for the peace officer in the claim or civil action. However, in the event that the court determines that a reserve officer, as defined in section  16-2.5-110, C.R.S., incurred the liability while acting outside the scope of his or her assigned duties or that the reserve officer acted in a willful and wanton manner in incurring the liability, the court shall order the reserve officer to reimburse the political subdivision or the state institution of higher education for reasonable costs and reasonable attorney fees expended for the defense of the reserve officer. With the approval of the governing body of the city, town, county, city and county, or other political subdivision or of the state institution of higher education, the claim or civil action may be settled or compromised. A city, town, county, city and county, or other political subdivision or a state institution of higher education may carry liability insurance to insure itself and its peace officers. If the political subdivision or state institution of higher education purchases insurance that provides substantial coverage for the peace officers with a policy limitation of at least one hundred thousand dollars for one person in any single occurrence and three hundred thousand dollars for two or more persons for any single occurrence, except that in such instance no indemnity shall be allowed for any person in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, then the political subdivision or state institution of higher education shall be liable under this section to indemnify the peace officers only to the extent of the limits and for such torts as are covered by the policy and only to the extent of the coverage of the policy. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to condone the conduct of any peace officer who uses excessive force or who violates the statutory or constitutional rights of any person.

       conflict regarding the reimbursement of defense costs for level I peace officers.
       The Governmental Immunity Act pertains to governmental employees generally, while this section defines the rights of police officers specifically. It is well settled that, in the event of apparent statutory conflict, specific language overrides general language.

       Time limitations.
       The only time limitation, other than the statute of limitations, imposed upon one seeking to hold a governmental entity secondarily liable is the requirement contained within this section. Antonopoulos v. Town of Telluride, 187
       <cite class="co_code">

       Immunity for tortious act of municipal officer deemed matter of concurrent local and state concern.
       Governmental immunity for tortious acts of municipal police officers and, specifically, limitations on compensatory damages for personal injuries in actions against municipal governments, based on such tortious conduct, are matters of concurrent local and statewide concern. Frick v. Abell, 198
       <cite class="co_code">

       </cite>
       , 602 P.2d 852 (1979).

      <p>
       And municipality may increase compensation to tort victims.
       A municipality may provide greater monetary compensation to victims of torts committed by the municipality’s own police officers than is provided under state statutes. Frick v. Abell, 198
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 508

       , 602 P.2d 852 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a municipality provides its police officers with defense costs against tort actions is a matter of both state and local concern.
       Therefore, to the extent, if any, that the municipal charter conflicts with state law, this section supersedes the charter. Brown v. Gray, 227 F.3d 1278 (10th Cir. 2000).

         Recognize the important work of the dog protection task force in developing the training and incorporating the specifics of the training into the statutes. The seventeen members appointed to the task force represented a victim of a dog shooting, veterinarians, animal welfare advocates, animal behaviorists, animal control officers, the sheriffs, the police, and legal professionals. The training includes instruction regarding a dog’s body language and how to interpret it, scene assessment, tools to use in dog encounters, situations involving multiple dogs, how to interact with a dog, and responses to dog behavior. The dog encounters training required by this section was designed to protect law enforcement officers, animal control officers, dog owners, innocent bystanders, and the dog. The training is not intended to provide dangerous dog training. Most importantly, the training was designed to limit, as much as feasible, the instances in which an officer would need to use deadly force against a dog, since the possibility of collateral damage, injury, or death from stray rounds is ever-present when a law enforcement officer uses deadly force.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11a">
         The people of Colorado have a fundamental interest in the development of harmonious and cooperative relationships between public employers and firefighters, particularly related to safety issues;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11b">
         The state has an obligation to protect the public safety by assuring, at all times, the orderly and uninterrupted operation of fire protection agencies;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11c">
         In order to continually maintain public safety, firefighters must be denied the right to strike;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11d">
         The denial by some public employers of the right of firefighters to organize and bargain collectively or meet and confer leads to various forms of strife and unrest, which obstruct public safety, and when the right to strike is denied, collective bargaining with the possibility to meet and confer are the appropriate counterbalance to prevent the obstructions to public safety;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11e">
         Unresolved disputes between firefighters and their public employers harm the public, the governmental agencies, and the employees involved;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11f">
         Experience has proven that legal protection of the right of firefighters to organize safeguards public safety by removing certain recognized sources of strife and unrest and encouraging practices fundamental to the amicable resolution of disputes over compensation, hours, and terms and conditions of employment and by creating equality of bargaining power between public employers and the firefighters that they employ;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11g">
         The Colorado wildfires of 2012 demonstrate the potential for loss of life and property damage associated with natural disasters. Responding to natural disasters requires a coordinated response by, and the significant contribution of staffing and resources from, fire departments all around the state. The departments are required to work closely with one another during these times, which demonstrates the statewide nature of fire protection and natural disaster response. Most departments have automatic mutual aid agreements with adjacent departments that blur jurisdictional lines even further. The ability to coordinate and cooperate is critical to effective fire protection and disaster response in the state.
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11h">
         It is the policy of this state to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to public safety and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they occur by:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11hI">
           Protecting the exercise by firefighters of full freedom of association, self-organization, and other mutual aid or protection without fear of intimidation or retaliation;
          </li>
          <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11hII">
           Encouraging and promoting the practice and procedure of collective bargaining;

          <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11hIII">
           Protecting the right of firefighters to designate representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of collective bargaining, and protecting their right to participate in the political process while off duty and not in uniform, like any other citizen of this state; and
          </li>
          <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11hIV">
           If approved by a vote of the citizens of a jurisdiction, obligating public employers and employee organizations of firefighters to enter into collective bargaining with the willingness to resolve disputes relating to compensation, hours, and the terms and conditions of employment and to reduce to writing any agreements reached through negotiations; and
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol11i">
         Collective bargaining for firefighters is a matter of statewide concern that affects the public safety and general welfare, as the Colorado supreme court held in
    , 193Colo. 437, 566 P.2d 1356 (1977). The citizens of Colorado have the right to expect a consistently high level of public safety throughout the state, which will allow the economy of Colorado to grow and prosper.

      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p02-s29-5-202ol12">
       It is also the policy of this state to obligate public employers to meet and confer with their firefighters, upon request, to discuss safety, equipment, and noncompensatory matters.

       House Bill 07-1008, enacted in 2007, established a rebuttable presumption in the state workers’ compensation system that certain types of cancer, when contracted by firefighters, are occupational diseases caused by employment as a firefighter.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p04-s29-5-401ol12">
       Nine years of experience has shown that the rebuttable presumption established by House Bill 07-1008 has produced no demonstrable benefit to firefighters but has led to significantly greater costs to employers of firefighters.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p04-s29-5-401ol13">
       The purpose of this part 4 is to provide supplemental income and reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs not otherwise paid for by insurance coverage to firefighters who contract covered cancers and to reduce the cost of workers’ compensation insurance for employers of firefighters. This part 4 is not a replacement for workers’ compensation coverage or any other kind of medical insurance.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar05-p04-s29-5-401ol14">
       This part 4 does not eliminate or curtail the obligation of an employer of firefighters to participate in the state workers’ compensation system, nor does it eliminate or curtail the right of a firefighter to pursue benefits under the state workers’ compensation system. Rather, it provides a practical alternative for firefighters to pursue in dealing with the costs and burdens of covered cancers without being forced to rely on recovering compensation under the rebuttable presumption created by House Bill 07-1008.

    Any county through its board of county commissioners shall have the power, authority, and jurisdiction to regulate and control public recreation lands and facilities owned or operated by the county by the promulgation of rules and regulations pursuant to a lawfully adopted resolution. The rules and regulations may include but are not limited to the following: Removal, destruction, mutilation, or defacing of any natural object or man-made object owned by the county; explosives or any form of firearm; animal control; any public use, including boating, fishing, camping, or hunting; and polluting or littering. Any person violating any rule or regulation lawfully adopted pursuant to this subsection (2) commits a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.

      The general assembly declares that there is a need for parks, trail systems, and open space in urban areas of this state, that existing rights-of-way for high voltage electric transmission lines in such areas occupy significant land which could also be utilized for parks, trail systems, and open space, and that the safety of these lines could be enhanced by adopting appropriate safety measures as a part of utilizing this land for parks, trail systems, and open space. The general assembly further declares that the purpose of this article is to encourage the dedication and the utilization of such land for public parks, trail systems, and open space and the implementation of additional safety measures for these electric transmission lines.

This article shall not apply to any dedication or grant of use of a transmission right-of-way unless both the owner of the transmission right-of-way and the fee owner of the land involved consent to the dedication or grant of use. The park board may accept or reject this offered dedication or use of the transmission right-of-way based on the reasonable needs of the public, applicable rules and regulations governing the park board, and other criteria normally applied by the park board in accepting or rejecting dedications of land. In accepting or rejecting such offer, the park board shall consider, among other factors, methods for enhancing the safety of the transmission right-of-way involved through design of the park, trail, or open space improvements. The park board shall also consider and protect the interests and property rights of adjacent landowners, particularly those adjacent to the termination points of trails, who are not participating in the dedication or grant of use of the transmission right-of-way. If needed, the park board shall provide an access or egress from the point of termination to a public street or highway. For purposes of this article, the right of eminent domain shall not be exercised to obtain ingress or egress. Nothing in this article shall prevent negotiations for a dedication or grant of use of a transmission right-of-way in incorporated areas from occurring during the subdivision approval process; except that such dedication or grant of use shall not be finalized until the final subdivision plat is approved.

     Legislative declaration.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly finds that landowners, cities, towns, counties, public utilities, and cable operators in many areas of the state desire to convert existing overhead electric and communication facilities to underground locations. The general assembly further finds that the conversion of overhead electric and communication facilities to underground locations is a matter of statewide concern and interest. The general assembly declares that a public purpose will be served by providing a procedure to accomplish such conversion and that it is in the public interest to provide for such conversion by proceedings taken under this article, whether such areas are within the limits of a city or town or within a county. The general assembly further declares that all political subdivisions shall pursue such conversion only in accordance with this article; except that the use of the procedure set forth in this article is permissive and not mandatory for incidental and episodic conversions associated with public improvements such as street widening or sewer construction. Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, a political subdivision shall be able to perform such underground conversion without following the procedures outlined in this article if the political subdivision pays for all of the costs and expenses of such conversion from the political subdivision’s own funds on the condition that the political subdivision does not seek to recover the costs or expenses of such conversion from the public utility or cable operator.

     <p>
      When any improvement authorized to be made by any governing body by the terms of this article is ordered, the governing body shall provide for the apportionment of the cost and expenses thereof as in its judgment may be fair and equitable in consideration of the benefits accruing to the abutting, adjoining, contiguous, and adjacent lots and lands, and to the lots and lands otherwise benefited and included within the improvement district formed. Each lot and parcel of the land shall be separately assessed for the cost and expenses thereof in proportion to the number of square feet of such lands and lots abutting, adjoining, contiguous, and adjacent thereto or included in the improvement district, or assessed upon a frontage, zone, or other equitable basis, in accordance with the benefits, as the same may be determined by the governing body.

       Any governing body may on its own initiative, or upon a petition signed by at least a majority of the property owners owning at least a majority of the assessable land of any proposed district requesting the creation of an improvement district as provided in this article, pass a resolution at any regular or special meeting declaring that it finds that the improvement district is in the public interest. It must be determined that the formation of the local improvement district for the purposes set out in this article will promote the public convenience, necessity, and welfare.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-106ol12">
       The resolution must state that the costs and expenses will be levied and assessed upon the property benefited and further request that each public utility serving such area by overhead electric or communication facilities shall make a study of the cost of conversion of its facilities in such area to underground service.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-106ol13">
       The report of said study shall be provided to the governing body and made available in its office to all owners of land within the proposed improvement district. The resolution of the governing body shall require that the public utility be provided with the name and address of the owner of each parcel or lot within the proposed improvement district, if known, and if not known the description of the property and such other matters as may be required by the public utility in order to perform the work involved in the cost study.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-106ol14">
       The resolution shall further state the governing body’s preliminary determination as to the method of assessing each lot or parcel within the proposed improvement district area and shall provide the square feet or frontage feet of each lot or parcel, and zone or other information necessary for assessment in accordance with the governing body’s preliminary determination. All public utilities serving such improvement district areas by overhead electric or communication facilities shall, within one hundred twenty days after receipt of the resolution, unless such time is extended, make a study of the costs of conversion of their facilities in such district to underground service, and the public utilities shall together provide to the governing body, and make available at their respective offices, a joint report as to the results of the study.

       The public utility report shall set forth an estimate of the total underground conversion costs and shall also indicate the costs of underground conversion of facilities of the public utility located within the boundaries of the various parcels or lots then receiving service. The report shall also contain the public utility’s recommendations concerning the feasibility of the project for the district proposed insofar as the physical characteristics of the district are concerned.

Representatives of the public utility concerned shall be present at all such hearings. Such hearing may be adjourned from time to time to a fixed future time and place. If at any time during the hearings it appears to the governing body that changes in the proposed improvements or the proposed district should be made, which, after consultation with the public utility concerned, appear to affect either the cost or feasibility of the improvements, the hearing shall be adjourned to a fixed future time and place and a new cost and feasibility report prepared on the basis of the contemplated changes.

No appeal shall lie from the order dismissing said proceedings. Nothing in this section may prevent the filing of subsequent petitions for a similar district. The right to renew such a proceeding is expressly granted and authorized.

       After the hearing has been concluded and after all persons desiring to be heard have been heard, the governing body shall consider the arguments put forth and may make such changes in the area to be included in the district as it may consider desirable or necessary. However, no such changes shall be made unless a costs and feasibility report has been prepared on the basis of such changes.

       If there is no such petition outstanding, the governing body, after consideration of matters brought forth at the public hearing, shall either abandon the district and project or adopt a resolution establishing the district and authorizing the project, either as described in the notice or with changes made as authorized in this section. Such resolution shall be published in the manner provided in section  29-8-111 but need not be mailed. If a resolution is adopted establishing the district, such resolution shall finally and conclusively establish the regular organization of the district against all persons, unless an action attacking the validity of the organization is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction within thirty days after the adopting of such resolution. Such action shall be subject to the provisions of section  29-8-113. Thereafter, any such action shall be perpetually barred and the organization of said district shall not be directly or collaterally questioned in any suit, action, or proceeding.

       After the preparation of the aforesaid resolution, notice of a public hearing on the proposed assessments shall be given. Such notice shall be published one time in a newspaper in which the first notice of hearing was published at least twenty days before the date fixed for the hearing, and shall be mailed not less than fifteen days prior to the date fixed for such hearing to each owner of real property whose property will be assessed for part of the cost of the improvement at the last known address of such owner, using for such purpose the names and addresses appearing on the last completed real property assessment rolls of the county wherein said affected property is located. In addition, a copy of such notice shall be addressed to “owner” and shall be so mailed, addressed to the street number of each piece of improved property to be affected by such assessment.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-116ol12">
       Each notice shall state that at the specified time and place the governing body will hold a public hearing upon the proposed assessments and shall state that any owner of any property to be assessed pursuant to the resolution will be heard on the question of whether his property will be benefited by the proposed improvement to the amount of the proposed assessment against his property and whether the amount assessed against his property constitutes more than his proper proportional share of the total cost of the improvement.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-116ol13">
       The notice shall further state where a copy of the resolution proposed to be adopted levying the assessments against all real property in the district will be on file for public inspection, and that subject to such changes and corrections therein as may be made by the governing body, it is proposed to adopt the resolution at the conclusion of the hearing.

      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-116ol14">
       The public notice shall describe the boundaries or area of the district with sufficient particularity to permit each owner of real property therein to ascertain that his property lies in the district. The mailed notice may refer to the district by name and date of creation and shall state the amount of the assessment proposed to be levied against the real property of the person to whom the notice is mailed. In the absence of fraud, the failure to mail any notice does not invalidate any assessment or any proceeding under this article.

No sale of property for the nonpayment of taxes or other special assessments shall extinguish the lien of other than the taxes or special assessments for the nonpayment of which such sale is had.

     Advance payment of assessment installments.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body may, in the resolution levying the assessments, provide that all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may (but only in their entirety) be paid prior to the dates on which they become due, if the property owner paying such installments pays all interest which would accrue thereon to the next succeeding date on which interest is payable on the bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of the assessments. In addition, the property owner must pay such additional amount of interest as in the opinion of the governing body is necessary to assure the availability of money fully sufficient to pay interest on the bonds as interest becomes due, and any redemption premiums which may become payable on the bonds in order to retire, in advance of maturity, bonds in a sufficient amount to utilize the assessments thus paid in advance. If no bonds have been issued, then all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may be paid in their entirety prior to the date upon which they become due by paying the principal amount due and the interest accrued thereon to the date of payment.

       After the expiration of thirty days from the effective date of the resolution levying the assessments, the governing body may borrow money and issue negotiable interest-bearing bonds in a principal amount not exceeding the unpaid balance of the assessments levied. The bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body. The resolution shall prescribe the form of said bonds, the manner of their execution, which may be effected by the use of the facsimile signatures of the officers of the governing body in accordance with the laws of the state in effect at the time of their execution, shall provide for the terms thereof, including the maximum net effective interest rate for the issue of bonds, and may direct that the bonds shall be sold at public or private sale at or below par. The bonds shall not be sold at a price such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds exceeds the maximum net effective interest rate authorized.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-129ol12">
       The governing body shall prescribe other details in connection with the issue of bonds. The bonds so authorized shall mature serially over a period of not exceeding twenty years, but in no event shall such bonds extend over a longer period of time than the period of time over which such installments of special assessments are due and payable and ninety days thereafter.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-129ol13">
       The bonds shall be of such form and denomination and shall be payable in principal and interest at such times and place, and shall be sold, authorized, and issued in such manner as the governing body may determine. The bonds shall be dated no earlier than the date on which the special assessment shall begin to bear interest, and shall be secured by and payable from the irrevocable pledge and dedication of the funds derived from the levy and collection of the special assessments in anticipation of the collection of which they are issued. Said resolution and bonds may also include such other terms or recitals which, in the judgment of the governing body, are necessary or proper to render the same marketable.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-129ol14">
       Any premium received on the sale of the bonds may be applied as other bond proceeds or if not so applied, the same shall be placed in the fund for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds. The bonds shall be callable for redemption from the proceeds of the sale of any property sold for the nonpayment of special assessments, but not otherwise unless the bonds on the face thereof provide for redemption prior to maturity. The governing body may provide that the bonds shall be redeemable on any interest payment date prior to maturity pursuant to such notice and at such premiums as it deems advisable. Interest may be evidenced by interest coupons attached to such bonds and signed with a facsimile signature, as above provided, of one of the individuals who signed the bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t29-miscellaneous-ar08-s29-8-129ol15">
       In connection with the issuance of bonds payable solely from special assessments, the governing body may provide for the submission of the question of issuing such bonds to the registered electors eligible to vote on the question. For local improvement districts created by the governing body of any county pursuant to this article, the governing body may provide that all registered electors of the county shall be eligible to vote on the question or that only registered electors who are owners of property within or residents of the district shall be eligible to vote. For local improvement districts created by the governing body of any city or town pursuant to this article, the governing body may provide that all registered electors of the city or town shall be eligible to vote on the question or that only registered electors who are owners of property within or residents of the district shall be eligible to vote.

       In connection with the issuance of bonds payable from special assessments which are additionally secured by a pledge of any other funds of the county, city, or town, the governing body may provide for the submission of the question of issuing the bonds to all registered electors of the county, city, or town.

     Maintenance, construction, and title to converted facilities.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The public utility has the duty to maintain, repair, and replace all underground facilities installed under this article. There shall be no competitive bidding as to the construction of the converted facilities since existing facilities are owned, maintained, and operated by the public utility and the continuity of service of the utility is essential, both of which make construction work by third persons impracticable. Therefore, the public utility concerned shall be responsible for the accomplishment of all construction work and may contract out such of the construction work as it deems desirable. Title to the converted facilities shall be at all times solely and exclusively in the public utility involved, as the public is only purchasing the intangible benefits which come from converted facilities, that is, the removal of the overhead facilities and replacement by underground facilities.

In no event shall the bill for conversion cost presented by the public utility exceed the amount of estimated conversion costs by the public utility.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that dialing 911 is the most effective and familiar way the public has of seeking emergency assistance. Basic emergency service and public safety is fundamentally a government concern and the exercise of police powers for the protection and betterment of the health, safety, security, and welfare of the public. This part 1 as amended by House Bill 20-1293, enacted in 2020, is intended to provide funding mechanisms for the continued technological advancement of emergency telephone service for all users of the system.

         In order to provide for the future of 911 technology advancement in Colorado, local funding and local control must be maintained, while at the same time, additional funding for projects, programs, and services must also be provided. It is therefore the intent of the general assembly to maintain and strengthen the existing local funding structure for emergency telephone service in the state while also creating a new funding mechanism for local expenditures that will improve the quality of the emergency telephone service statewide.

The 2-1-1 human services referral service is dedicated to providing individuals and families with referral information to obtain nonemergency services such as food assistance, shelter, job assistance, and low-cost health care, for those in need. Due to the importance of the human services referral system and the need to assure that this system is enabled in all areas of the state of Colorado, the general assembly hereby finds and declares that the 2-1-1 human services referral service providers should receive protection of immunity that is similar to the protection afforded to the

         In the absence of common sense relief, laws imposed and administered at the local level requiring businesses to obtain permits or licenses to operate, with the distinct possibility of criminal or civil penalties for noncompliance, may be used to ensnare minors wanting to operate small-scale businesses on a very limited basis; and

         These laws impose inordinate and heavy-handed regulatory burdens on minor entrepreneurs who are not seeking to compete with fully established commercial entities operated by adults, frustrate and thwart entrepreneurial activity minors have undertaken from the founding of the republic as a means to learn about business and economic principles and to make money, and divert law enforcement resources of local governments from investigating and prosecuting more serious criminal or civil matters.

       By enacting this article 11.3, the general assembly intends to provide a uniform ban on the imposition and administration of such licensing and permitting laws across the state, avoid the inconsistent application of licensing and permitting laws depending upon the political subdivision in which a minor’s business is being operated, and give every minor entrepreneur across the state an even playing field within which to gain practical experience in business and economic matters and an opportunity to make money by operating a business on a limited basis that does not intend to compete with permanent, ongoing commercial entities operated by adults. Toward this end, the general assembly further declares that the matters discussed in this section are matters of statewide concern. Notwithstanding the enactment of this article 11.3 and the protections it affords minor entrepreneurs, the general assembly encourages minor entrepreneurs to understand that, in order to successfully compete as adults in the business world, they will need to fully comply with the existing regulatory and legal environment.

      This article 11.8 is intended to provide minimum standards for the licensing of escort bureaus, escorts, and escort bureau runners. Nothing in this article 11.8 shall prohibit a local government from enacting an ordinance providing more stringent standards for such licensing, but such ordinance shall meet the minimum standards established by this article 11.8.

Such a request shall not be acted upon until the implementing action by resolution or ordinance has been accomplished.

       Ambiguity in insurance contract with regard to the retroactive date of the contract must be resolved by giving effect to the intention of the parties,
       and, therefore, the date which the parties to the contract intended, based on undisputed testimony, is the date that coverage began. Bd. of County Comm’rs v.

       Court rejected county’s contention that the policy was unconscionable as a matter of law because it had a short policy period
       and provided no coverage prior to its retroactive date since the county intended to obtain limited coverage, with no insurance during the gap period and was precisely in accord with the county’s reasonable expectations. Bd. of County Comm’rs v.

However, impact fees and other development charges can affect growth and development patterns outside a local government’s jurisdiction, and uniform impact fee authority among local governments will encourage proper growth management.

       General assembly’s grant of land use authority to local governments under the enabling act necessarily implies the authority of a local government to impose, through a public hearing process, a moratorium of limited duration, 10 months in this case, or to halt further development pending adoption of a master plan.
       The length and conditions of a moratorium are subject to the protection of property owners against uncompensated takings as provided by part 2 of article 20 of this title. Droste v. Bd. of County Comm’rs of Pitkin, 159 P.3d 601 (Colo. 2007).

      <p>
       The enabling act grants broad powers to local governments regulating use of lands within their respective jurisdictions for protecting wildlife, controlling population density and growth, and protecting the surrounding environment, among other things.
       In light of this broad grant of powers, reading the enabling act to deny local governments authority to conduct studies for overall development of lands within their jurisdiction and to impose reasonable moratoriums on development to conduct those studies would be anomalous and would contravene the apparent purpose and intent of the general assembly. Droste v. Bd. of County Comm’rs of Pitkin, 141 P.3d 852 (Colo. App. 2005), aff’d, 159 P.3d 601 (Colo. 2007).

      <p>
       County had authority under the enabling act to impose temporary moratorium on developmental approvals concerning certain land within county.
       The enabling act is designed to give local governments additional or supplemental powers for the purposes set forth in the act, including development in hazardous areas, protecting wildlife habitats, protecting areas of historical or archeological significance, controlling population density, and providing for the phasing in of infrastructure. These special considerations, in many instances, supplement those normally involved in creating a zoning master plan or administering a zoning regimen. Accordingly, the enabling act and the county planning statute, article 28 of title 30, have different, though complementary, purposes, and the limitation on temporary zoning in §

       Subsections (1)(e), (1)(g), and (1)(h) do not provide requisite authority to county to regulate roads on landowner’s property.
       Here, record does not provide a factual predicate to support county’s argument. With respect to subsection (1)(e), there is nothing in the record to indicate what, if any, population changes may arise as a result of landowners’ activities nor is there anything in the record to support a conclusion that any changes in population would be “significant”. With respect to subsection (1)(g), there is nothing in the record elucidating any impact, significant or not, on the community or surrounding areas. Finally, with respect to subsection (1)(h), the county has not specifically adopted ordinances that deal with the particular roads at issue, as the roads are situated on parcels that are not subject to subdivision regulation.

       Local government land use regulations must require final local government action on any application of a public utility or a power authority providing electric or natural gas service that relates to the location, construction, or improvement of major electrical or natural gas facilities within one hundred twenty days after the utility’s or authority’s submission of a preliminary application, if a preliminary application is required by the local government’s land use regulations, or within ninety days after submission of a final application. If the local government does not take final action within such time, the application is deemed approved. Within twenty-eight days of the submission by a utility or authority of an application pursuant to this subsection (2), the local government shall notify the utility or authority of any additional information that must be supplied by the utility or authority to complete the application. The notice must specify the particular provisions of the local government’s land use regulations that necessitate submission of the required information. The one hundred twenty- or ninety-day period, as applicable, during which the local government is to take action on an application commences on the date that the utility or authority provides the requested information to the local government in response to the notice required by this subsection (2). If the local government does not notify the utility or authority within twenty-eight days that additional information is required to complete the application, the one hundred twenty- or ninety-day period, as applicable, commences on the date of the submission by the utility or authority of its application, and any request by a local government for additional information after the completion of the twenty-eight-day period does not extend the applicable deadline for final local government action in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (2). A local government may request additional information from a state agency, and the state agency shall submit the additional information within the initial twenty-eight-day period if the request is made within a reasonable amount of time. In no event shall a request for additional information, or a failure by a state agency to provide the additional information requested, extend any deadline for local government action or notification as set forth in this section.

       Practical effects of this part 2 was to codify the test for regulatory takings announced by the United States supreme court in Nollan v. Cal. Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994).
       These opinions established the presumption that a local government that conditions approval of a proposed development on an exaction of property effects a compensable taking. This presumption can be overcome only if the local government proves that (1) there is an “essential nexus” between the dedication or payment and a legitimate government interest; and (2) the dedication or payment is “roughly proportional” both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed use or development of such property. Consequently, under this part 2, a local government that requires a landowner to “dedicate real property to the public or pay money or provide services to a public entity in an amount that is determined on an individualized and discretionary basis” must first satisfy each prong of the Nollan/Dolan test.

       Practical effects of this part 2 was to codify the test for regulatory takings announced by the United States supreme court in Nollan v. Cal. Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994).
       These opinions established the presumption that a local government that conditions approval of a proposed development on an exaction of property effects a compensable taking. This presumption can be overcome only if the local government proves that (1) there is an “essential nexus” between the dedication or payment and a legitimate government interest; and (2) the dedication or payment is “roughly proportional” both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed use or development of such property. Consequently, under this section, a local government that requires a landowner to “dedicate real property to the public or pay money or provide services to a public entity in an amount that is determined on an individualized and discretionary basis” must first satisfy each prong of the Nollan/Dolan test.

       City’s decision to condition landowner’s land-use permit on the payment of drainage fees falls outside of ambit of this part 2.
       Drainage fee assessed upon landowner by city falls under the exception of subsection (1) for legislatively formulated fees that are imposed upon a broad class of property owners. Wolf Ranch, LLC v. City of

       Because landowner’s operation included “new water use”, this section requires the board of county commissioners to consider
       whether the amount of water used exceeded the statutory threshold and thus whether the board had to review the application as a development permit under subsection (1). Because the board did not do so, it abused its discretion by approving landowner’s application. Hajek v. Bd. of County Comm’rs for Boulder,

       It is the purpose of this section to provide for the designation of emergency response authorities for hazardous substance incidents. Every emergency response authority designated in or pursuant to this section is responsible for providing and maintaining the capability for emergency response to a hazardous substance incident occurring within its jurisdiction. An emergency response authority may provide and maintain the capability for such response directly or through mutual aid or other agreements, including an agreement with a private entity to support the emergency response authority, responding fire departments, or other government agencies. Subject to the provisions of local or regional response agreements for hazardous substance incidents, the first emergency response authority, or its public agency designee through mutual aid or otherwise, to arrive at the scene of the incident, regardless of whether the incident occurs within its jurisdiction, is responsible for the emergency response as incident commander until such time as the emergency response authority that has jurisdiction over the incident site has arrived, after which unified command shall be followed until the emergency response has concluded. As used in this section, “emergency response to a hazardous substance incident” means taking the initial emergency action necessary to minimize the effects or threat of adverse effects of a hazardous substance incident on human health or the environment.

       If a hazardous substance incident occurs on private property and is otherwise reportable to any federal, state, or local agency, the owner of the property or person or entity operating on the property shall promptly report the incident to and coordinate a response with the appropriate emergency response authority designated in or pursuant to this section. If the owner or operator does not undertake or coordinate an emergency response or if, in the judgment of the designated emergency response authority, there exists an imminent danger to human health or the environment beyond such property, the designated emergency response authority may undertake the emergency response to such hazardous substance incident, as provided in this section. Nothing in this subsection (2) shall be construed to prohibit the owner of private property or a person or entity operating on such property from undertaking the emergency response to a hazardous substance incident occurring on the property.

A private entity that is neither a responsible party nor otherwise compensated may claim its costs only when it provided services under an agreement with the designated emergency response authority or fire department pursuant to section  29-22-102 or  29-22-103 that provides that the private entity will not be paid by the designated emergency response authority or fire department. A private entity may assist a fire department or designated emergency response authority in pursuing such a claim under subsection (3) of this section; however, the fire department or designated emergency response authority must approve the claim. When the action to remove, contain, or otherwise mitigate the effects of such an incident also involves extinguishing a fire, the costs may only include the extraordinary expenses related to the hazardous substance and not any expense related to extinguishing the fire. If the property on which the hazardous substance incident occurred lies within an unincorporated area of a county and not otherwise within a fire protection district, then the costs may include any expense related to the hazardous substance incident or to extinguishing the fire. If any such person is the owner of property upon which the hazardous substance incident occurs, collection of such costs may be made pursuant to section  30-10-513.5 (1), C.R.S.

The local government or each member of the combination shall approve or disapprove the operating plan within thirty days after receipt of such operating plan and all requested documentation relating thereto, but not later than December 5 of the year in which such documents are filed. Thereafter, the services and financial arrangements of the district shall conform so far as practicable to the operating plan. The operating plan may, from time to time, be amended by the district with the approval of the local government or each member of the combination in substantially the same manner as the process for formulating the operating plan for each year. Any material departure from the operating plan, as originally approved or amended from time to time, may be enjoined by an order of the local government filed with the board.

       The general assembly finds and declares that:
       <ol Class="alpha">
        <li id="t29-medicalproviderfees-ar28-s29-28-101ol11a">
         Medicaid reimbursement rates cover only approximately sixty-five percent of the actual costs incurred by service providers rendering services to medicaid recipients;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-medicalproviderfees-ar28-s29-28-101ol11b">
         Low medicaid reimbursement rates and increased caseloads have caused the costs to shift within the health-care delivery system, resulting in higher medical costs for the general population;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-medicalproviderfees-ar28-s29-28-101ol11c">
         The medicaid caseload continues to expand and, therefore, the need for providers to serve these medicaid recipients continues to increase;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-medicalproviderfees-ar28-s29-28-101ol11d">
         Rising health-care costs are a primary concern for Colorado citizens and businesses;
        </li>
        <li id="t29-medicalproviderfees-ar28-s29-28-101ol11e">
         It is therefore in the best interest of the state of Colorado to authorize local governments to impose a fee on certain medical providers to assist in financing medicaid costs and the disproportionate share hospital payments for providing medical services to low-income populations.

         The direct marketing of agricultural products to the public through farm stands benefits the agricultural community and the consumer by, among other benefits, providing an alternative method for agricultural producers to sell their products while supplying quality agricultural products at reasonable prices;

        <li id="t29-immigrationstatus-cooperationwithfederalofficials-ar31-s29-31-101ol11b">
         The direct marketing of agricultural products benefits the agriculture industry by bringing producers of agricultural goods face-to-face with consumers;

         The state has a compelling interest in maximizing the promotion of agricultural goods produced or grown in Colorado and in promoting access to a wide variety of Colorado-produced agricultural products;

        <li id="t29-immigrationstatus-cooperationwithfederalofficials-ar31-s29-31-101ol11d">
         Farm stands allow farmers and other agricultural producers to sell fresh agricultural produce and other agricultural goods grown on the principal use site on which the farm stand is located as well as other food products made with ingredients produced on or near the principal use site; and

        <li id="t29-immigrationstatus-cooperationwithfederalofficials-ar31-s29-31-101ol11e">
         In many jurisdictions across the state, a farm stand is not permitted to operate if located on a principal use site that is smaller than a certain acreage size. These restrictions operate in this manner because, in many jurisdictions across the state, a principal use site cannot be classified as a farm that is able to conduct agricultural operations unless the site exceeds a certain minimum acreage requirement.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t29-immigrationstatus-cooperationwithfederalofficials-ar31-s29-31-101ol12">
       By enacting this article 31 the general assembly intends to provide a uniform and consistent permission across the state for farm stands to undertake agricultural operations on principal use sites that are smaller than a certain acreage size. Such uniformity in the law prevents inconsistent application of the law, depending upon the political subdivision in which a farm stand may be operated, and assists with the state’s efforts to support to the greatest extent possible the marketing of agricultural goods produced or grown in Colorado and the promotion of a wide variety of Colorado-produced agricultural products. Toward this end, the general assembly further declares that the matters addressed in this article 31 are matters of statewide concern.

     Farm stands.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a farm stand may be located on a parcel of any size. The retail sale of goods to the public by a farm stand must include goods or other agricultural products that are grown or produced on the principal use site on which the farm stand is located or may include agricultural products resulting from agricultural operations that are not conducted on the principal use site to the extent permitted by the applicable local government. Nothing in this article 31 prohibits a local government from requiring the operator of a farm stand to obtain a valid license or permit or to comply with any other applicable laws prior to operating the farm stand but in no way shall such local permitting, licensing, or other applicable legal requirements deny the use of the site as described in this section.
