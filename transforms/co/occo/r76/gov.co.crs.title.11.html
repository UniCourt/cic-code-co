         The board shall ascertain the aggregate amounts of public funds held by the defaulting depository as disclosed by the records of such depository. The board shall determine for each official custodian for whom public funds are held by the defaulting depository the accounts and the amount of federal deposit insurance that is available for each account. It shall then determine for each such official custodian the amount of uninsured public funds and the eligible collateral that is pledged to secure such funds. Upon completion of this analysis, the board shall provide each such official custodian with a statement that reports the amount of public funds held by the defaulting depository in his behalf, the amount that may be protected by federal deposit insurance, and the amount that is safeguarded by eligible collateral as required by this article. Each such official custodian shall verify this information from his records within ten working days after receiving the report and information from the banking board.

Any liquidation occurring under the provisions of this section shall conform to the procedures established in section  11-103-804.

     Common trust funds established and operated.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any bank or trust company qualified to act as fiduciary in this state may establish and operate, alone or jointly with another bank or trust company qualified to act as fiduciary in this state, common trust funds for the purpose of furnishing investments to itself as fiduciary, to itself and others as cofiduciaries, to other banks or trust companies as fiduciaries, or to other banks or trust companies and others as cofiduciaries. Such fiduciary or cofiduciary may invest funds which it lawfully holds for investment in interests in such common trust funds, if such investment is not prohibited by the instrument, judgment, decree, or order creating such fiduciary relationship, and if, in the case of cofiduciaries, the bank or trust company procures the consent of its cofiduciaries to such investment. Any person acting as cofiduciary with any such bank or trust company is hereby authorized to consent to the investment in such interests. In determining whether the investment of funds received or held by a bank or trust company as fiduciary in a common trust fund is proper, the bank or trust company may consider the common fund as a whole and shall not be prohibited from making such investment because of any particular asset.

     <p>
      Unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the bank or trust company operating such common trust funds is not required to render a court accounting with regard to such funds; but, by application to the district court, it may secure approval of such an accounting on such conditions as the court may establish.

     Fiduciary defined.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The word “fiduciary”, whenever used in this article, means a bank or trust company undertaking to act alone or jointly with others primarily for the benefit of another or others in all matters connected with its undertaking and includes personal representatives [including executors, administrators, administrators with the will annexed (cum testamento annexo), administrators in succession acting under a will (de bonis non), ancillary administrators acting under a will, and ancillary executors], special administrators, guardians, conservators, trustees, whether of express or implied trusts, custodians under the “Colorado Uniform Transfers to Minors Act” (notwithstanding anything in said act which may be interpreted as contrary to this grant of authority), assignees, receivers, managing agents, as defined in this section, and any other person acting in a similar capacity. “Managing agent” means a fiduciary acting in the fiduciary relationship assumed upon the creation of a relationship which confers investment discretion on the fiduciary, but as to which the technical legal relationship is that of agent and principal.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions in this section to the contrary, if the board has given the required notice of a hearing and as of the tenth day prior to the hearing has received no written protest against such application, the board may grant such community field of membership without a hearing if the applicants are known to the board.

      The commissioner shall cause to be prepared a standard form of bylaws, consistent with this article, to be issued to all credit unions. All credit unions shall operate under the standard bylaws; except that each such credit union, subject to the approval of the commissioner, shall propose its own name, its field of membership, the number of members of its board of directors, its credit committee, its supervisory committee, provisions relative to times and places of meetings of the membership and of the board of directors, provisions relative to the conduct of elections and balloting of the credit union, and modifications of the standard bylaws deemed appropriate by the board of directors for the operation of the individual credit union. Any and all amendments to the bylaws shall be approved by the commissioner before they become operative.

       Credit union membership shall consist of the incorporators and any other persons and organizations which are elected to membership and which pay any entrance fee. Organizations, incorporated or otherwise, composed for the most part of the same general group as the credit union membership may be members. A central credit union may be organized under this article and may have a membership made up principally of other credit unions organized pursuant to this article or any credit unions authorized to operate within the state of Colorado, and such membership may also include the officers and committee members of such credit unions, members or persons within the field of membership of credit unions within the state which have entered into or are about to enter into voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceedings, and small groups which the commissioner determines lack the potential membership to organize their own credit union if such groups have a common bond of employment or association.

      <li id="t11-creditunions-ar30-s11-30-103ol12">
       Credit union organization and membership, other than those of a central credit union, shall be limited to groups having a common bond of employment or association or groups which reside within a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district having a population of no more than twenty-five thousand or as otherwise authorized by the board. Small groups which the commissioner determines to lack the potential membership to organize their own credit union may be eligible for membership in an existing credit union if such small groups have a common bond of employment or association. A member of the immediate family of any person who, under the provisions of this article, is eligible for membership in a credit union may also be admitted to membership therein. “Immediate family” means persons related by blood, by marriage, or by adoption.

      <li id="t11-creditunions-ar30-s11-30-103ol13">
       A member who leaves the field of membership of the credit union may retain membership in the credit union as provided by the bylaws of the credit union.

       Except as to accounts, which are defined in and which shall be paid as provided for in article 15 of title 15, C.R.S., nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit credit unions organized under this article from carrying membership accounts in the names of two or more persons in joint tenancy; and, if any credit union transacting business in this state issues shares and deposits in the names of two or more persons payable to them or to any of them, such shares and deposits, or any part thereof or any interest or dividend thereon, may be paid to any one of said persons whether the others are living or not, and the receipt or acquittance of the person so paid shall be a valid and sufficient discharge to the credit union from all of said persons and their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, and such shares and deposits shall be deemed to be owned by said persons in joint tenancy with the right of survivorship.

         Credit unions shall be under the supervision of the commissioner. Every credit union shall be examined by the commissioner at least once during any eighteen-month period. The commissioner shall assess each credit union an amount to cover the expenses of the division attributable to the supervision of state-chartered credit unions subject to the commissioner’s jurisdiction. The amount assessed shall be determined according to a schedule or schedules or any other method established by the commissioner to be appropriate, but the assessment shall be at the same rate for all credit unions; except that the commissioner may establish a separate rate schedule for corporate and central credit unions. The commissioner may waive the payment of all or a portion of the assessment with respect to the year in which a charter is issued or canceled or in which a final distribution is made in liquidation.

       The commissioner has the power to charge off the whole or any part of any asset of any credit union which could not be lawfully acquired by it and to reduce the value of any asset of a credit union to its market value or to a reasonable value, if no market value can be established. If the losses of a credit union exceed its undivided earnings and reserve funds so that the reasonable value of its assets is less than the total amount due the shareholders, the commissioner may order a reduction in the liability to each shareholder, dividing the loss proportionately among all shareholders. Any reduction from each share account shall be a specified percentage sufficient to correct the impaired condition and preserve the solvency of the credit union. If thereafter the credit union shall realize from such assets a greater amount than that fixed by the order of reduction, such excess shall be divided proportionately among the shareholders to whom liability was previously reduced but only to the extent of such reduction.

Upon application of the commissioner, any person served with a subpoena issued by him may be required, by order of the district court of the county where the credit union has its principal office, to appear and answer such questions as may be put to him by the commissioner and be required to produce such books, papers, or documents in his possession as may be required by the commissioner.

         After notice and a hearing as provided in article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., and after making a determination that no other appropriate governmental agency has taken similar action against such person for the same act or practice, the commissioner may assess and collect a civil money penalty from any person who has violated any final cease-and-desist order issued by the commissioner pursuant to section  11-30-106 (7) or any suspension order issued pursuant to section  11-30-120.

         In extraordinary circumstances, upon order of the commissioner, any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be exempt from any provision of law requiring that proceedings of the commissioner be conducted publicly.

       Civil money penalties shall be assessed by written notice of assessment of a civil money penalty served upon the person to be assessed. The notice of assessment of a civil money penalty shall state the amount of the penalty, the period for payment, the legal authority for the assessment, and the matters of fact or law constituting the grounds for assessment. The notice of assessment of a civil money penalty may be appealed to the financial services board pursuant to section  11-44-101.8. On appeal, the board may consider, among other matters, whether the civil money penalty assessed by the commissioner is appropriate considering the financial resources of the person assessed.

       In determining the amount of the civil money penalty to be assessed, the commissioner shall consider the good faith of the person assessed, the gravity of the violation, any previous violations by the person assessed, and such other matters as the commissioner may deem appropriate; except that the civil money penalty shall be not more than one thousand dollars per day for each day the person assessed is determined by the commissioner to be in violation of a cease-and-desist order or an order of suspension or removal. Alternatively, the commissioner may assess a civil money penalty for such violation in a lump-sum amount not to exceed fifty thousand dollars.

If any person fails to pay an assessment after it has become due and payable, the commissioner may refer the matter to the attorney general, who shall recover the amount assessed by action in the district court for the city and county of Denver. Any civil money penalty collected pursuant to this section shall be transmitted to the state treasurer, who shall credit it to the general fund.

     <p>
      The capital of a credit union shall consist of the payments that have been made to it in shares by the several members thereof. The credit union has a lien on the shares and deposits of a member for any sum due to the credit union from said member or for any loan endorsed by him. A credit union may charge an entrance fee and an annual membership fee, but such fees shall be uniform to all members.

Such order shall be in writing and delivered by registered or certified mail.

       Each domestic savings and loan association shall have such fiscal year as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of its board of directors, but the fiscal years of all such associations shall be fixed so as to end as of the last day of a calendar month. Every domestic savings and loan association shall close its books at least once annually as of the close of business on the last day of its fiscal year and may close its books at such other time as may be fixed by resolution of its board of directors. Any reference in this section or elsewhere in articles 40 to 46 of this title to the closing date of an association means the date fixed for the closing of its books as provided in this section. The books and records of every association shall reflect all the accrued liabilities on the above dates.

The existence of a withdrawal list consisting of members desiring to withdraw from the association shall not prevent the board of directors of such association, in its discretion, from borrowing money from the federal home loan bank, to be used for the purpose of making mortgage loans to the members of the association or retiring bank loans, in which event all such amount of borrowed money may be exclusively used for the purpose borrowed or for other purposes, subject to the approval of the commissioner; but no savings and loan association shall at any time borrow money from the federal home loan bank in an amount exceeding any limit fixed by the laws of this state.

Appraisals may be made by any two of the association’s directors, officers, employees, or attorneys or by an independent appraiser who is not a director, officer, employee, or attorney of the association; but no such officer, director, employee, or attorney shall act as an appraiser nor act on any committee approving a loan in which he has an interest either in the property tendered as security or in the sale of the property. The association shall furnish to each borrower, upon the closing of the loan, a loan settlement statement, indicating in detail the charges or fees such borrower has paid or obligated himself to pay to the association or to any other person in connection with such loan, and a copy of such statement shall be retained in the records of the association.

An association may require life insurance to be assigned as additional security upon any real estate loan; in such event, the association shall obtain a first lien upon such policy and may advance premiums thereon, and such premium advances may be added to the unpaid principal of the loan and shall be equally secured by the first lien on the security property.

The amount of such monthly charges may be adjusted by the association as the need therefor arises. Every association shall keep an accurate record of the status of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, and other charges on all real estate securing its loans and on all real and other property owned by it.

       Payment on the principal indebtedness of all loans on real estate security shall be applied directly to the reduction of such indebtedness. Payments on all monthly installment loans, other than construction loans, insured loans, and guaranteed loans, shall begin not later than sixty days after the date of the note. Insured loans and guaranteed loans may be repayable upon terms acceptable to the insuring or guaranteeing agency. An association may charge, for the privilege of prepayment in part or in full of a loan relating to an owner-occupied single family residence, if the original contract so provides, an amount not greater than ninety days’ interest on the amount prepaid. An association may charge, for the privilege of prepayment in part or in full for any loan not otherwise specifically provided for in this subsection (9), an amount specified in the original contract. Any loan contract may be modified by the parties by written agreement and within the limitations of this section as the need therefor may arise.

       Courts generally will not interfere with management.
       In the absence of fraud, gross mismanagement, or ultra vires acts by those lawfully entrusted with the management of the corporation, under this section, neither a court of law nor equity has jurisdiction to interfere with or control the internal affairs or policy of the corporation. The rule applies to the setting aside of reserve funds and the declaration of dividends, and courts will not interfere with the discretion of directors in such matters unless they have acted fraudulently, capriciously, or unreasonably. Midland Sav. & Loan Co. v. Dunmire, 68 F.2d 249 (10th Cir. 1933).

       The board of directors of any association, at a meeting called for that purpose, may adopt a plan of reorganization of the association. Two copies of the proposed plan of reorganization, signed by the president or vice-president of such association, verified by his affidavit, and attested by the secretary or assistant secretary thereof, with the seal of the association thereunto affixed, shall be submitted to the commissioner for his approval or disapproval, and he shall cause a certificate of approval or disapproval to be attached to said proposed plan, one copy to be filed in the division and one returned to the association. If approved by the commissioner, such approved plan shall be presented to the members at a special meeting called for the purpose of considering and voting upon such approved plan. The complete plan of reorganization, as adopted by the board of directors and approved by the commissioner, shall be furnished each member at the time notice of such meeting, as required by section  11-41-123, is given. If at such meeting two-thirds of all votes of the members present in person or by proxy are in favor of such approved plan, the association may proceed to reorganize in accordance therewith.

       The proceedings of such meeting shall be submitted to the commissioner for his approval in the same manner as required for the submission of the plan by the board of directors. Unless the plan of reorganization fixes a later effective date thereof, the effective date of reorganization shall be the date upon which the commissioner accepts for filing the certified copies of the proceedings of the meetings of members adopting the approved plan of reorganization.

All obligations to any such prior association shall inure to the benefit of the reorganized association and shall be enforceable by it and in its name, and demands, claims, and rights of action against any such association may be enforced against it as fully and completely as they might have been enforced theretofore; and all deeds, notes, mortgages, contracts, judgments, transactions, and proceedings whatsoever theretofore made, received, entered into, carried on, or done by such association before such reorganization shall be as good, valid, and effectual in law as though such association had never been reorganized.

Upon the granting of such approval, a special meeting of all members entitled to vote shall be called in the manner provided by section  11-41-123.

       Stockholders, after their stock has been fully paid, are not liable to creditors or for assessments upon their stock issued on or after July 1, 1981, except as provided by this section. If the commissioner, as a result of any examination or from any report made to him, finds that the permanent stock of any association is impaired, he shall notify the association that such impairment exists. In the event the amount of the impairment, as determined by the commissioner, is questioned by the association, then, upon application filed within ten days, the value of the assets in question shall be determined by appraisals made by independent appraisers acceptable to the commissioner and the association.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-108ol12">
       If the bylaws of an association expressly give the directors the authority to levy an assessment on permanent stock, then, subject to any limitations contained in the bylaws, the directors may levy and collect assessments upon permanent stock. The directors of an association which has received such notice may levy a pro rata assessment upon the permanent stock thereof to make good such impairment and shall cause notice of the finding of the commissioner and such levy to be given in writing to each stockholder of such association and the amount of assessment which the stockholder must pay for the purpose of making good such impairment; but, in lieu of making such assessment, the impairment may be made good, without the consent of the commissioner, by the reduction of the permanent stock in the manner provided in section  11-42-107.

       Shares may be sold of stockholder who refuses to pay assessment.
       Where a stockholder refuses to pay an assessment properly levied under this statute, the corporation can sell some of that stockholder’s shares in order to raise the amount of the assessment. Equity Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Great W. Mtgs., Inc., 31

       Issue of directors’ negligence cannot be used as a defense to an assessment.
       The fact, if it be a fact, that the board of directors was negligent or acted improperly in causing the corporation to be in an impaired capital position did not constitute a basis for stopping the sale of stock of those stockholders who refused to pay the stock assessment, where the issue was not before the court, but rather is an issue which would be the basis of a separate independent action.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-112ol11">
       No association shall sell, offer for sale, negotiate for the sale of or take subscriptions for, or issue any of its permanent stock until it has first applied for and secured from the commissioner a permit authorizing it so to do. Such application shall be in writing, verified, and filed with the commissioner. In such application, the association shall set forth the names and addresses of its officers, the location of its office, an itemized account of its financial condition, the amount and character of its stock and shares, a copy of any prospectus or advertisement or other description of its stock to be distributed or published, a copy of all minutes of any proceedings of its directors, shareholders, or stockholders relating to or affecting the issue of such stock, and such additional information concerning the association, its condition, and its affairs as the commissioner may require. Upon the filing of such application, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to examine it and the other papers and documents filed therewith.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-112ol12">
       If he finds that the proposed issue is such as will not mislead the public as to the nature of the investment or will not work a fraud upon the purchaser thereof, the commissioner shall issue to the association a permit authorizing it to issue and dispose of its stock in such amounts as the commissioner may in such permit provide; otherwise he shall deny the application and notify the association in writing of his decision.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-112ol13">
       Every permit shall recite in bold type that the issuance thereof is permissive only and does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement of the stock permitted to be issued. The commissioner may impose conditions requiring the impoundment of the proceeds from the sale of such stock and limiting the expense in connection with the sale thereof and such other conditions as he may deem reasonable and necessary or advisable to insure the disposition of the proceeds from the sale of such stock in the manner and for the purposes provided in such permit. The commissioner from time to time may amend, alter, or revoke any permit issued by him or temporarily suspend the rights of such association under such permit. The commissioner has the power to establish such rules and regulations as may be reasonable or necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of this section.

       Any association may adopt a plan for the payment of a cash bonus to members agreeing to make share investments in order to provide funds for the financing of homes. Such plan, before being adopted, shall be approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors at any regular or special meeting thereof and shall become effective upon the filing with and approval of the commissioner. The board of directors at any regular or special meeting may abolish the bonus plan as to shares purchased after the date of such action.

      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-114ol12">
       After adoption and approval of such bonus plan, the board of directors shall transfer out of net earnings to an account designated “bonus reserve” an amount which, together with existing credits to the bonus reserve, is sufficient to pay the bonus on all accounts then entitled to participation in the bonus reserve in accordance with the provisions of this section. The board of directors may transfer any excess in the bonus reserve to the undivided profits account.

     Power to issue shares to minors or in trust.

      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-115ol11">
       Every association has the power to issue stock or shares to a minor of any age and either sex and receive payments thereon from, by, or for the minor. He shall be entitled to withdraw, transfer, or pledge any such shares owned by him and to receive from such association any dividends or other moneys at any time becoming due thereon in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an adult, and his receipt or acquittance therefor shall constitute a valid release and discharge to the association for the payment of such moneys. The dealing of an association with a minor shall have the same effect upon the association’s liability as if the minor were of full legal capacity, until his guardian or conservator files with the association a certified copy of the order of a Colorado court having jurisdiction appointing the guardian or conservator and directing otherwise.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-115ol12">
       Subject to such regulations as the board of directors of the association may prescribe, an association may contract with the proper authorities of any public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school or any public or charitable institution caring for minors for the participation by the association in any school or institutional thrift or savings plan.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-115ol13">
       Every association has power to issue stock or shares to any person on a revocable trust for another person, who is either named in writing as beneficiary thereof or who is unnamed. At any time during the lifetime of the trustee, the stock or shares, together with dividends, if any, shall be withdrawn only by the trustee. On the death of the trustee, the stock or shares, together with dividends, if any, shall be paid to the person for whom the stock or shares were issued as designated beneficiary, even though the beneficiary is not of full legal capacity, and, if there is no designated beneficiary living at that time, then to the personal representative of the trustee.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar42-s11-42-115ol14">
       The foregoing authorization shall not be construed as providing an exclusive method for a trustee to invest in stock or shares of an association. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting or repealing either section  28-5-214 or  28-5-301, C.R.S., with respect to investment of funds by guardians and conservators of minor and incompetent beneficiaries of the veterans administration, heretofore or hereafter appointed, or part 3 of article 1 of title 15, C.R.S., with respect to investments by fiduciaries.

       This section is a “doing business law”.
       Even though this section regulates foreign savings and loan associations by prohibitions rather than by conditions, it is still a “doing business law”. In addition, imposition of criminal sanctions, such as those in this section, is not atypical of a “doing business law”. Title Ins. Co. of Minn. v. Am.

       Law reviews.
       For comment on United States Bldg. & Loan Ass’n v. McClelland, appearing below, see 7 Rocky Mt. L. Rev. 156 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a comprehensive article creating a building and loan department of the state,
       defining its powers, and giving it supervision over all foreign and domestic building and loan corporations doing business in this state, with power to grant certificates of business. United States Bldg. & Loan Ass’n v. McClelland, 6 F. Supp. 299 (D.
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 1934
       </cite>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a valid legislative enactment.
       Building and loan associations exercise quasi-banking functions, soliciting the savings and funds of the public, especially of those in more modest circumstances. The general assembly violates no constitutional guaranty in declaring them affected with a public interest and in providing, within proper limits, supervision and control for the protection of the investor.

The commissioner’s deputy or any employee of the commissioner, before being entitled to make such examination, shall produce under the hand and seal of the commissioner his or her authority to make such examination. The commissioner and his deputy have the power to administer oaths and to examine under oath any director, officer, employee, or agent of any association concerning the business and affairs thereof.

In any such case, the association shall pay a reasonable fee based on actual cost to be affixed by the commissioner for all such extra services rendered by the division or by such accountant.

Should any foreign association fail to pay the costs incurred in any such examination, such costs shall be paid by the state treasurer upon the order of the commissioner, and the amount so paid shall be a first lien upon all the assets and property of such association and may be recovered by suit by the attorney general on behalf of the state of Colorado and restored to the fund from which paid.

       If the commissioner, as the result of any examination or from any report made to him, finds that any association doing business in this state is violating the provisions of its articles of incorporation or bylaws or of the laws of this state provided for its government or is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, by an order addressed to such association, he may direct a discontinuance of such violations or unsafe or unauthorized practices and a conformity with all the requirements of law.

       The commissioner may, with the written approval of the board, take possession of the property, business, and assets of such an association and retain such possession until such association, with the consent of the commissioner, resumes business or until its affairs are liquidated.

The cost of such bond shall be paid from the assets of the association. Suit may be maintained on such bond by any person injured by a breach of the conditions thereof. This requirement may be deemed met if the financial services board determines that the association’s fidelity bond covers the conservator and any assistants.

After citing the commissioner to show cause why further proceedings should not be enjoined and hearing the evidence of the parties and determining the facts, the court may, upon the merits, dismiss such application or enjoin the commissioner from further proceedings and direct the commissioner to surrender such business, property, and assets to such association. An appeal from such judgment shall operate as a stay from the commissioner’s taking possession, and no bond need be given if such appeal is taken by the commissioner; but, if such appeal is taken by such association, a bond shall be given as required by the court.

     Appointment of commissioner as receiver - assignment for benefit of creditors prohibited.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon application to the district court, the commissioner may be appointed the receiver to operate a savings and loan association when such appointment is necessary to avoid the association’s assets becoming impaired or when the association is operating in an unsafe manner. In lieu of the commissioner being appointed a receiver or liquidator, the federal deposit insurance corporation or its successor, or an insurer authorized to insure obligations or accounts pursuant to articles 40 to 47.5 of this title, may be tendered an appointment as receiver or liquidator. For the purposes of rule 98 of the Colorado rules of civil procedure, venue of the commissioner is in the city and county of Denver. No savings and loan association shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors.

       The commissioner may retain possession of any savings and loan association for the purpose of liquidating its affairs, but before doing so he shall furnish a bond, executed by some surety company authorized to do business in this state and running to the people of the state of Colorado, in a penal sum equal to the value of the negotiable assets of the association, as nearly as may be determined, for the faithful discharge of his duties in connection with liquidating the affairs of the association and accounting for all moneys coming into his hands. Such bond shall be approved by the governor and be filed in the office of the secretary of state. The cost of such bond shall be paid from the assets of the association. Suits may be maintained on such bond by any person injured by a breach of the conditions thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-113ol12">
       Upon taking such possession, the commissioner shall have authority to collect all moneys due to such association, and to give full receipt therefor, and to do such other acts as are necessary or expedient to collect, conserve, or protect its business, property, and assets.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-113ol13">
       If the commissioner is in possession of the business, property, and assets of any association, regardless of whether or not he is liquidating the affairs of such association, the commissioner, in his discretion, may apply to the district court of the county in which the principal office in this state of such association is located for an order confirming any action taken by the commissioner or authorizing the commissioner to do any act or to execute any instrument not expressly authorized by articles 40 to 46 of this title, which order shall be made after a hearing, on such notice as the court shall prescribe. He may pay and discharge any secured claims against such association, and, within six months after taking such possession, he may disaffirm any executory contracts, including leases, to which such association is a party and disaffirm any partially executed contracts, including leases, to the extent that they remain executory.

     Liquidation powers of commissioner.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol11">
       In liquidating the affairs of an association, the commissioner has the power to collect all moneys due to and all claims of such association and give full receipt therefor; to release or reconvey all real or personal property pledged, hypothecated, or transferred in trust as security for loans; to approve and pay all just and equitable claims; to commence and prosecute all actions and proceedings necessary to enforce liquidations; to compound bad or doubtful debts and to compound and settle with any debtor or creditor of such association or with the persons having possession of its property or being in any way responsible at law or in equity to such association, upon such terms and conditions and in such manner as he deems just and beneficial to such association; in case of mutual dealings between the association and any person, to allow just setoffs in favor of such persons in all cases in which the same ought to be allowed according to law and equity; in case of borrowers holding shares of the association pledged to the association as security for said loan, to allow the amount paid in on said shares, together with all dividends legally declared thereon, to be set off against the amount due on said loan; and to sell, convey, and transfer real and personal property.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol12">
       If a purchaser for any bad or doubtful debts cannot be obtained and it appears improbable that recovery thereon can be had and that the costs of actions to enforce collections of the same would probably be lost, the court may direct that suits thereon need not be brought.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol13">
       For the purpose of executing and performing any of the powers and duties conferred upon him, the commissioner, in the name of such association or in his own name, may prosecute and defend any and all suits and other legal proceedings and, in the name of such association or in his own name, as commissioner, may execute, acknowledge, and deliver any deeds, assignments, releases, and other instruments necessary and proper to effectuate any sale of real or personal property or other transaction in connection with the liquidation of such association. Any deed, assignment, release, or other instrument executed pursuant to the authority given shall be valid and effectual for all purposes as though the same had been executed by the officers of such association by authority of its board of directors.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol14">
       In case any of the real property so sold is located in a county other than the county in which the application to the court for leave to sell the same is made, the commissioner shall cause a certified copy of the order authorizing or ratifying such sale to be filed in the office of the recorder of the county in which such real property is located.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol15">
       Upon determining to liquidate an association, the commissioner shall cause an inventory of all the assets of such association to be made in duplicate, the original to be filed with the court and the duplicate in the office of the commissioner. He shall cause due notice to be given, by publication once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation published at or near the principal place of business of such association in this state, to all persons having claims against it as creditors, or investors, or otherwise, to present and file same and make legal proof thereof at a place and within a time to be designated in such publication, which time shall be not less than two months after such first publication. Within ten days after such first publication, he shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to all persons whose names appear of record upon its books as creditors or investors, and, upon the expiration of the time fixed for the presentation of claims, the commissioner shall prepare or cause to be prepared in duplicate a full and complete schedule of all claims presented, specifying by classes those that have been approved and those that have been disapproved, and shall file the original with the court and the duplicate in the office of the commissioner. Not later than five days after the time of filing such schedule with the court, written notice shall be mailed to all claimants whose claims have been rejected.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol16">
       Action to enforce the payment of any rejected claim must be brought and service had within four months after the date of filing of the schedule of claims with the proper court; otherwise all such actions shall be forever barred. All claims of creditors, investors, or other persons against the association or against any property owned or held by it must be presented to the commissioner in writing, verified by the claimant or someone in his behalf, within the period limited in the notice mentioned in subsection (5) of this section for the presentation of claims; and any claims not so presented shall be forever barred; but the claim of any investor, appearing upon the books of the association as a valid claim, presented after the expiration of the time fixed in said notice shall be entitled to share in any dividends declared subsequent to the presentation of such claim.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol17">
       The commissioner under his hand and official seal may appoint one or more special deputies to assist in the duties of liquidation and distribution under his direction and may also employ such special legal counsel, accountants, and assistants as may be needful and requisite and fix the salaries and compensation to be allowed and paid to each, all to be in a reasonable and commensurate sum. All such salaries and compensation and such other reasonable and necessary expenses as may be incurred in the liquidation shall be paid by the commissioner from the funds of such association in his hands.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol18">
       From the net realization of such assets in excess of such salaries, compensation, and expenses, the commissioner shall first pay all approved claims other than to investors, and thereafter he shall distribute and pay dividends in liquidation to the shareholders and investors in the association, other than holders of permanent stock, until their claims are fully paid or such assets or funds are exhausted. Such distributions shall be made as funds are available therefor, to the extent of ten percent or more of the approved claims of the class of claimants then entitled to distribution, and shall continue until all the assets have been realized upon and a final dividend in liquidation is declared and paid.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol19">
       Upon the payment of a final dividend in liquidation, the commissioner shall prepare and file with the court a full and final statement of the liquidation, including a summary of the receipts and disbursements, and a duplicate thereof shall be filed in the office of the commissioner, and, after due hearing and approval by the court, the liquidation shall be deemed to be closed.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol110">
       The determination by the commissioner to liquidate any association, evidenced by filing written notice of such determination with the court, shall operate to stay or dissolve any actions or attachments instituted or levied within thirty days next preceding the taking of possession of such association by the commissioner, and, pending the process of liquidation, no attachment or execution shall be levied nor lien created upon any of the property of such association.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar44-s11-44-116ol111">
       Whenever, in case of any association which has issued permanent stock, the commissioner has fully liquidated all claims other than claims of such stockholders, and has made due provision for any and all known or unclaimed liabilities, excepting claims of permanent stockholders, and has paid all expenses of liquidation, he shall call a meeting of the stockholders of said savings and loan association by giving notice thereof for thirty days in one or more newspapers published in the county in which the principal office of the association is located. At such meeting the commissioner shall deliver to such stockholders all the property and effects of said association remaining in his possession, except its records, which shall be retained by him as part of the records of his office, and, upon such transfer and delivery, he shall be discharged from any and all further liability to said association or its creditors, and thereupon the association shall be in the same position as though it had never been authorized to transact a savings and loan business.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, whenever the commissioner finds that it is necessary to effect a merger, consolidation, purchase and assumption agreement, conversion to stock association, conversion to mutual association, conversion to federal association, or conversion to state association or other action, as a result of the assets of any association being impaired to the extent that it threatens loss to the withdrawable shares or the association being in an unsafe condition and the time required to give proper notice and hold a meeting to vote on the action is deemed by the commissioner to increase the threat of loss to the withdrawable shares, the commissioner may waive the requirement of a membership or stockholder vote on the action. There shall be no requirement of prior written notice to the affected parties of said waiver.

The notice of assessment of a civil money penalty may be appealed to the financial services board pursuant to section  11-44-101.8.

     Conversion into state association.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar45-s11-45-103ol11">
       Any federal savings and loan association may convert itself into an association under articles 40 to 46 of this title by the majority vote of all members present in person or by proxy at an annual meeting or at any special meeting called to consider such action. Copies of the minutes of the proceedings of such meeting of members, verified by the affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary, shall be filed in the office of the commissioner and mailed to the office of thrift supervision, or its successor, within ten days after such meeting. Such verified copies of the proceedings of the meeting when so filed shall be prima facie evidence of the holding and action of such meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-savingsandloanassociations-ar45-s11-45-103ol12">
       At the meeting at which conversion is voted upon, the members shall also vote upon the directors who shall be the directors of the state-chartered association after conversion takes effect. Such directors shall then execute two copies of the certificate of incorporation and four copies of the bylaws. The directors chosen for the association shall all sign and acknowledge the certificate of incorporation as subscribers thereto and the bylaws as incorporators of the association. The commissioner may provide, by regulation, for the procedure to be followed by any such federal savings and loan association converting into an association under articles 40 to 46 of this title. The state-chartered association shall be a continuation of the corporate entity of the converting federal association and continue to have all of its property and rights.

     <p>
      The commissioner may conduct an examination of the affairs of any provider as often as the commissioner deems it necessary for the protection of the interests of the people of this state. Providers shall maintain copies of their books and records in Colorado to provide access for the purposes of this article 49. The commissioner shall assess each provider at least semiannually, to cover the annual direct and indirect costs of examinations, supervision, and administration conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section. The assessments shall be calculated in terms of cents per thousand dollars of total escrowed entrance fees and reserves maintained. The assessment calculation, or ratio of the assessment charged to total escrowed entrance fees and reserves maintained, shall be alike in all cases. On or before the dates specified by the commissioner, each association shall pay its assessment. If deemed necessary, the commissioner may estimate a per diem rate to be charged for examinations and charge a provider for the actual cost of any examination documented by the commissioner.

       Purpose.

        Colorado securities act parallels the federal securities act of 1933 and the securities and exchange act of 1934. Sauer v. Hays, 36 Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343

      <p>
       And federal law is persuasive.
       While the Colorado supreme court is not bound by federal law in the interpretation of the Colorado securities act, insofar as the provisions and purposes of this statute parallel those of the federal enactments, such federal authorities are highly persuasive.

       The general assembly has made a policy judgment to follow federal law unless this article specifies a different policy.
       When deciding whether an ostensible general partnership interest in a venture is a security under federal law, the federal courts employ a strong presumption that it is not. Because it is undisputed that the partnership agreement gives the partners partnership powers and this article does not specify a different policy, the federal presumption applies in this case.

       Jurisdiction.
       Whether the contracts are executed in Colorado or out of state is irrelevant since the Colorado securities act expressly covers the solicitation of an offer to buy in this state, and actual execution of a contract within the state is not essential to the exercise of jurisdiction over appellant. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192

      </p>

       No requirement that entire transaction occur in Colorado.
       The disjunctive “or” used in subsection (1) reinforces the view that, whenever either the offer or the sale occurs in this state, the

       The hallmark of state and federal securities regulation
       has always been close attention to the facts of each case and a substantive appraisal of the commercial realities of the offering. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125

      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative intent.
       Such expansive language in the Colorado statute defining “security” indicates a legislative intent to provide the flexibility needed to regulate the various schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others with the lure of profits. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125

       , 556 P.2d 1201 (1976); Griffin v. Jackson, 759 P.2d 839 (Colo. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose.
       The broad purpose of securities acts is to prevent the exploitation of investors through full and fair disclosure relative to the issuance of securities. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 112
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1209 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Securities acts are remedial in nature and should be broadly construed
       to effectuate their purpose. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192
       <cite class="co_code">

       Parallels federal acts.
       The
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colorado securities act parallels the federal securities act of 1933 and the securities and exchange act of 1934. Sauer v. Hays, 36 Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343
       </cite>
       (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “security” in the federal securities act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. § 77b(1)) is parallel to Colorado’s definition; “investment contract” is included as a “security” under both statutes; and, therefore, federal cases on the subject can be persuasive. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Div. of Sec., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 112
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1209 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of a security embodies a flexible rather than a static principle.
       Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192

      </p>
      <p>
       Investment contract defined.
       An investment contract for purposes of the securities act means a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Div. of Sec., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 112
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1209 (1976); Griffin v. Jackson, 759 P.2d 839 (Colo. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The transaction’s substance and economic realities control, not what a party labels the transaction. Jenkins v. Jacobs, 748 P.2d 1318 (Colo. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Question of law.
       Whether an interest or instrument is an investment contract is a question of law to be determined by the court. Straub v. Mtn. Trails Resort, Inc., 770 P.2d 1321 (Colo. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Determining whether a transaction is a security.
       Whether a transaction is a security is a question of fact to be determined by the jury. People v. Hoover, 165 P.3d 784 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the jury’s responsibility to apply the facts to the definition of “security” supplied by the court to decide whether a particular transaction is a security. People v. Pahl, 169 P.3d 169 (Colo. App. 2006); People v. Hoover, 165 P.3d 784 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a particular transaction involves a security depends not on the name or the form of the instrument, but on the substantive economic realities underlying the transaction. Joseph v. Viatica Mgmt., LLC, 55 P.3d 264 (Colo. App. 2002); People v. Hoover, 165 P.3d 784 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The three-part test to determine if a transaction is an investment contract, included within the definition of “security”, establishes whether such transaction is: (1) An investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with the expectation of profit from the efforts of others. People v. Hoover, 165 P.3d 784 (Colo. App. 2006); Joseph v. Mieka Corp.,
       <cite class="COA">
        2012 COA 84
       </cite>
       , 282 P.3d 509.
      </p>
      <p>
       A “security” is defined to include an “investment contract”, but, because this article doesn’t define an “investment contract”, state courts apply the three-part test set forth in federal law.
       The critical factor in analyzing this general partnership agreement is whether the partners were dependent on the managerial efforts of others for their expected profits. Where the parties’ agreement purports to give participants rights typical of those possessed by a general partner, there is a strong presumption that the general partnership interests are not investment contracts. The case is remanded for the trial court to determine whether the presumption applies here. Chan v. HEI Res., Inc.,
       <cite class="COA">
        2020 COA 87

       Joint venture agreement was an illusory general partnership, and investments in it were investment contracts.
       Joint venture lacked the hallmarks of traditional general partnership in that: Investors lacked the right or ability to vote on the admission or exclusion of new investors; investors could not bind the joint venture; investors had not taken any votes or action concerning management decisions; investors lacked sufficient voting power to remove the operator; respondents did not inquire into or assess investors’ specific knowledge or sophistication concerning the joint venture activity; and respondents solicited a large number of investors with whom they had no prior relationship. Joseph v. Mieka Corp.,
       <cite class="COA">
        2012 COA 84
       </cite>
       , 282 P.3d 509.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investment notes issued by loan association were securities
       where each noteholder entrusted money with expectation of periodic interest in addition to repayment of principal, interest rates were raised periodically, investors’ return was dependent upon continuing operation and success of business, and investor’s expectation of profit was derived solely from managerial efforts of others. People v. Milne, 690 P.2d 829 (Colo. 1984), overruled in Thompson v. People, 2020 CO 72, 471 P.3d 1045.
      </p>
      <p>
       Determining whether a promissory note is a security is based on an analysis of whether the promissory note is within one of seven categories of notes that are excluded from being a security and, if not,
       an analysis of whether the note bears a strong family resemblance to one of the excluded categories. Thompson v. People, 2020 CO 72, 471 P.3d 1045 (following Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56 (1990), and overruling
    People v. Milne, 690 P.2d 829 (Colo. 1984)).

       Commodity accounts may be investment contracts and thus securities.
       In order to qualify as an investment contract, a commodity account must involve an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others. Clayton Brokerage Co. v. Stansfield, 582 F. Supp. 837 (D.

       Pyramid sales scheme as a security.
       A pyramid sales scheme is no less a security because of the sale of distributorships where what, in essence, was being offered was an opportunity to contribute money and to share in the profits of an enterprise managed and owned by Master Industries. Sauer v. Hays, 36
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343
       </cite>
       (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       A pyramid promotional scheme involved an “investment contract”, a “common enterprise” whereby the “fortunes of the investors” were “inextricably tied” and dependent upon the efforts and success of the corporation in obtaining and recruiting new prospects for its seminars and in consummating sales, and constituted the sale of securities in violation of
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colorado’s securities act. Sauer v. Hays, 36 Colo. App. 190, 539 P.2d 1343
       </cite>

      </p>
      <p>
       Promoters of pyramid promotional plans must make full, complete, and fair disclosure,
       through the registration statement, of the perils involved before their prospects invest their money. Sauer v. Hays, 36

       Agreements to promote inventions.
       Agreements whereby an inventor paid a fee to petitioner and assigned a percentage interest in the invention or a fee plus a commission on any net proceeds received as a result of petitioner’s efforts in exchange for certain promotional services were held not to be “securities”. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Div. of Sec., 192
       <cite class="co_code">

       The element of commonality was absent where no other inventor acquired any interest in, nor received any direct benefit from, a particular inventor’s invention. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Div. of Sec., 192
       <cite class="co_code">

       The sale of condominium property, when accompanied by collateral agreements involving rental of the units,
       did constitute the sale of a “security” within the meaning of the Colorado statute. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1201 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a rental agreement imposed by an investment company selling condominiums was mandatory and exclusive as to all purchasers, and that the rental rate, supporting services, and promotion and allocation of renters were all controlled by a common agent, made the venture a “common enterprise” for the purpose of defining an investment contract. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1201 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the finding of a “secondary” purpose of personal recreational use, this subordinate motive for a purchase of a condominium did not sufficiently eclipse the plaintiffs’ primary purpose of an “expectation of profit”. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">

       Plaintiff’s percentage interest in real estate venture met the statutory definitions of a security

      </p>
      <p>
       A contract to jointly purchase viatical settlements of life insurance policies is an investment contract and thus qualifies as a security.
       A fund that invests in life insurance settlements and sells such investments is a security. Joseph v. Viatica Mgmt., LLC, 55 P.3d 264 (Colo. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction.
       Whether the contracts are executed in Colorado or out of state is irrelevant since the Colorado securities act expressly covers the solicitation of an offer to buy in this state, and actual execution of a contract within the state is not essential to the exercise of jurisdiction over appellant. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192

       Acting as a lead trader for an auto-trading platform,

The securities commissioner may, by rule or order, determine the conditions of any escrow required under this subsection (5), but the securities commissioner may not reject a depository solely because of its location in another state.

The securities commissioner may, by rule or order, waive the requirements of this subsection (6), in whole or in part, with respect to any class of registrations or any specific registration if the securities commissioner finds that such waiver is in the public interest and that compliance with the requirements of this subsection (6) is not necessary for the protection of investors.

       Design of private offering exemption.
       The private offering exemption was designed principally to permit the issuance of securities in transactions in which the remedial purposes of registration were satisfied by independent factors. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">

       Question of fact.
       The test as to whether or not an offering is public is a question to be determined from the facts in each particular case. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125

       Availability of nonpublic offering exemption in subsection (1)(i) is a question of fact.
       People v. Morrow, 682 P.2d 1201 (Colo. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Each “offering” to be separately assessed.
       To determine the public nature of an offering, the predicates for the exemption must apply to the offerees as a group and should not be analyzed on an investor-by-investor basis. Each “offering” must be separately assessed. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1201 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The real test as to whether or not an offering is public
       is whether the particular class of persons affected needs the information made available by registration. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1201 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Criteria for test.
       As to the statutory test for determining whether an offering is private, criteria established by the Colorado division of securities include: (1) The number of offerees and actual purchasers; (2) the offeree’s relationship to the issuer; (3) the offeree’s knowledge; (4) the manner of the offering; (5) whether the offer is made in a medium intended for general distribution; and (6) a commitment by the offeree that the security is taken for investment only and not for resale or redistribution. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1201 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       When requirements for private offering exemption satisfied.
       The requirements for private offering exemption are satisfied only if “each offeree . . . does not require the information which would be set forth in a registration statement”. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125

      </p>
      <p>
       Securities were not exempt from registration requirements under subsection (1)(p)
       where respondents engaged in a general solicitation and thus the offering was not conducted in accordance with rule 506 of regulation D promulgated under the federal Securities Act of 1933. Black Diamond Fund, LLLP v. Joseph, 211 P.3d 727 (Colo. App. 2009).

      If a licensed person has died or ceased to exist as a legal entity, has been adjudicated incompetent, or cannot be located by the securities commissioner after a reasonable search, the securities commissioner may by order summarily revoke the license on the grounds that the license has been abandoned.

       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section appears to be the analogue of § 10(b) of the federal securities and exchange act.

      </p>
      <p>
       Federal authorities are highly persuasive when, as here, the Colorado Securities Act parallels federal enactments. Lowery v. Ford Hill Inv. Co., 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 125
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1201 (1976); Rosenthal v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 883 P.2d 522 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is identical to section 101 of the uniform securities act,
       which act this state has adopted. People v. Terranova, 38 Colo. App. 476, 563 P.2d 363 (1976); Ohio v. Peterson, Lowry, Rall, Barber & Ross, 472 F. Supp. 402 (D.

      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) is sufficiently explicit
       in its terms to inform persons of ordinary intelligence of the conduct that is criminally proscribed and thus passes constitutional muster in the face of a void-for-vagueness challenge. People v. Riley, 708 P.2d 1359 (Colo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>

       as required by rule 9(b) of the

       deals with matters not included within the ambit of this section,
       and so there is no violation of equal protection in the differing sanctions imposed by the sections as the classification made by the legislature in enacting the sections is not arbitrary or unreasonable. People v. Blair, 195
       <cite class="co_code">

      <p>
       Like proscriptions and no explicit private cause of action.
       This section and § 10(b) of the federal securities and exchange act are alike in their proscriptions of fraudulent conduct and in the fact that neither statute explicitly creates a private cause of action. Kerby v. Commodity Res. Inc., 395 F. Supp. 786 (D.

        Colo. 1975

      </p>

       Jury may find that trust arrangements are “securities”,
       and thus subject to sanction under this section. People v. Blair, 195
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 462
       </cite>
       , 579 P.2d 1133 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonmanagerial interest in partnership may be a security;
       and, therefore, a person may be convicted of securities fraud for the sale thereof. People v. Robb, 215 P.3d 1253 (Colo. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the prosecution in a criminal securities case relies on the theory that the relevant instrument is a note, the jury must be instructed that not all notes are securities
       and must be instructed to use the test in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 110 S. Ct. 945, 108 L. Ed. 2d 47 (1990), to determine whether the relevant instrument is a security. People v. Mendenhall,
       <cite class="COA">
        2015 COA 107
       </cite>
       M, 363 P.3d 758.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the statutory language including the term “note” in the definition of “security” makes for a presumption that a note is a security.
       People v. Thompson,
       <cite class="COA">
        2018 COA 83
       </cite>
       , 474 P.3d 79, aff’d, 2020 CO 72, 471 P.3d 1045.
      </p>
      <p>
       The note in this case is held to be a security because it meets three of the four factors under Reves v. Ernst & Young and People v. Mendenhall, which is annotated above. People v. Thompson,
       <cite class="COA">
        2018 COA 83

       Court did not err in allowing jury to determine whether a joint operating agreement involved a security in a criminal securities fraud case.
       There was sufficient evidence to support a determination that the form 610 agreement was an investment contract and, therefore, a security. People v. Pahl, 169 P.3d 169 (Colo. App. 2006).

       The required mental state for securities fraud is “willful”.

       Proof of knowledge that an investment is a security is not required to convict a defendant for “willful” securities fraud.

       Thus, jury instruction stating that the prosecution does not have to prove defendant was aware that he or she was dealing with a security is permissible. People v. Rivera, 56 P.3d 1155 (Colo. App. 2002); People v. Hoover, 165 P.3d 784 (Colo. App. 2006); People v. Destro, 215 P.3d 1147 (Colo. App. 2008).

       A violation of subsection (1)(b) does not require scienter, that is, intent to defraud.

       But instruction as to “specific intent” insufficient.
       With regard to securities law violations, the use of the term “specific intent” in jury instructions confuses matters and adds little or nothing productive or illuminating and thus, instructions given under this section are to be phrased only in terms of “knowingly”, “willfully”, and “aware”.

       Instruction on the definition of materiality not error.
       Appellate court rejected defendant’s argument that the definition was incorrect because it was a civil, objective standard and was inconsistent with subsection (1)(b). The structure of the
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colorado Securities Act demonstrates the general assembly’s intent to define general provisions applicable to both criminal and civil violations. Definitions derived from civil law may be applied to criminal statutes. Thus the definitions in part 2 apply generally to all parts of the Colorado Securities Act, whether those parts are at issue in a civil or criminal case. People v. Prendergast, 87 P.3d 175

       (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence in the record supports commissioner’s determination that information not disclosed was material.
       Nondisclosure of finder’s license revocation and permanent injunction constituted an omission of a material fact necessary in order to make statements in private placement memorandum not misleading. The issue is not whether the finder could continue to act as a finder for respondents after finder’s license was revoked but rather whether respondents should have disclosed that information, when it became known to them, in order to make other information not misleading. Black Diamond Fund, LLLP v. Joseph, 211 P.3d 727 (Colo. App. 2009).

      <p>
       Because the effect of instructing the jury that good faith is not a defense to a securities fraud prosecution was to create a substantial risk that the jury would find the defendant guilty of violating this section
       even if the defendant had acted in good faith, the instruction was thus irreconcilably at odds with the court’s prior instruction on the culpability element of willfulness. People v. Riley, 708 P.2d 1359 (Colo. 1985); Heller v. People, 712 P.2d 1023 (Colo. 1986); Thornton v. People, 716 P.2d 1115 (Colo. 1986).

       Advice of counsel is relevant
       to a charge of fraudulent practices in connection with a sale of securities, and a defendant should be entitled to show, if he can, that he sold the securities based upon his good faith reliance on such advice that he could do so legally. People v. Terranova, 38

       But is not absolute defense.
       Reliance on advice of counsel is not an absolute defense to the charge of fraudulent practices in connection with the sale of securities but rather merely a factor for the jury to consider. People v. Terranova, 38

       A claim for misrepresentation under the Colorado Securities Act
       does not depend upon the exempt or nonexempt status of the security. The misrepresentation may occur in the context of the registration statement for a nonexempt security or in the promotion or negotiations for sale of an exempt or nonexempt security. Western-Realco Ltd. v. Harrison, 791 P.2d 1139 (Colo. App. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plain language of this section makes no distinction between an untrue statement of a material fact and a failure to state a material fact.
       Thus the supreme court will not create such a dichotomy and disapproves any reading of the Securities Act of 1981 that results in such a practice. Rosenthal v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 908 P.2d 1095 (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar transaction evidence of whether the defendants engaged in a pattern or practice and a plan, scheme, or design
       in regard to the alleged fraud and violation of the Colorado Securities Act related to a material fact and the trial court erred in not allowing the plaintiffs to present such evidence where the probative value thereof was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Munson v. Boettcher & Co., Inc., 832 P.2d 967 (Colo. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arbitration of claims under this section was final such that plaintiff was collaterally estopped from reasserting same claims under federal securities laws.

       Annotator’s note.
       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings may be instituted by order.
       Proceedings need not be commenced by a complaint, but may be instituted by the issuance of an order setting forth the facts and conduct warranting a “show cause” order. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 112
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1209 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the extent of the order for production of documents
       which requested information from appellant regarding activities, contracts, and clients, whether occurring within or outside the state, such order was admittedly broad, but the commission’s power to enforce the securities act is equally broad. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 112
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1209 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Information on out-of-state activities allowed.
       When only at the investigatory stage did the commission seek information about the out-of-state activities of appellant over which it could not regulate, such an investigative procedure is permitted. Raymond Lee Org., Inc. v. Sec. Comm’n, 36 Colo. App. 417, 543 P.2d 75 (1975), rev’d on other grounds, 192
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 112
       </cite>
       , 556 P.2d 1209 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Individual defendant has standing to challenge failure
       of the commissioner of securities to give defendant notice of the issuance of administrative subpoenas for corporate bank account records during investigation into securities law violations which was directed at both the defendant and the corporation. People v. Lamb, 732 P.2d 1216 (Colo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to provide individual defendant with notice
       prior to execution of administrative subpoenas for production of corporate bank records during investigation into securities law violations did not require suppression of such bank records because the defendant was not prejudiced as the subpoenas were issued in full compliance with statutory and constitutional requirements except for notice. People v. Lamb, 732 P.2d 1216 (Colo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Transactional immunity provided in this section is not self-executing upon notification to the commissioner that a witness intends to claim a privilege against self-incrimination,
       but instead requires both a determination of the likelihood of self-incrimination and a court order compelling the revelation of the subpoenaed evidence. Feigin v. Zinn, 789 P.2d 478 (Colo. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       To receive immunity from criminal prosecution as set forth in subsection (4), an individual subpoenaed to testify or to produce documents before the securities commissioner must first invoke the protections of the fifth amendment.
       Then the securities commissioner must apply to the district court for an order compelling evidence or other information pursuant to subsections (3) and (4). Only after such an order has been issued does the immunity provided in subsection (4) apply to the testimony so compelled. People v. District Court of Arapahoe County, 894 P.2d 739 (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court’s order granting commissioner’s motion for leave to take expedited discovery did not compel witness to testify at his deposition.
       The order entered was simply a general order regarding the time at which civil discovery could be commenced; the trial court did not direct the witness to answer particular questions, nor was it requested to do so. People v. District Court of Arapahoe County, 894 P.2d 739 (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Colorado rules of civil procedure are not directly applicable to enforcement proceedings under the Securities Act.
       However, a court may consider the policies underlying C.R.C.P. 45(b) in ruling on a motion for the advancement of costs incurred in complying with an administrative subpoena. Feigin v.
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. Nat’l Bank, 897 P.2d 814
       </cite>
       (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the exercise of their equitable authority, district courts may quash an administrative subpoena found to be unreasonable or oppressive. Feigin v.
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. Nat’l Bank, 897 P.2d 814
       </cite>
       (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a general rule, recipients of subpoenas in criminal proceedings must assume the cost of compliance as a matter of civic responsibility.
       However, an individualized determination is called for when it is claimed that the cost of compliance with a subpoena renders the subpoena itself unreasonable and oppressive. The person seeking to quash an administrative subpoena on such grounds has the burden of establishing the precise amount of the cost and that such amount exceeds the amount the recipient would reasonably be expected to incur as a civic responsibility. Feigin v.
       <cite class="cocode">
        Colo. Nat’l Bank, 897 P.2d 814

       Whenever it appears to the securities commissioner upon sufficient evidence satisfactory to the securities commissioner that any person has engaged in or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this article or of any rule or order under this article, the securities commissioner may apply to the district court of the city and county of Denver to temporarily restrain or preliminarily or permanently enjoin the act or practice in question and to enforce compliance with this article or any rule or order under this article. If the action is against a broker-dealer, investment adviser, federal covered adviser, sales representative, or investment adviser representative and the court finds that such person has committed a violation of section  11-51-501, in addition to any other relief, the court may enter an order imposing such conditions on such person as the court deems appropriate. In any such action, the securities commissioner shall not be required to plead or prove irreparable injury or the inadequacy of the remedy at law. Under no circumstances shall the court require the securities commissioner to post a bond.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-securities-ar51-p06-s11-51-602ol12">
       The securities commissioner may include in any action authorized by subsection (1) of this section, relating to any violation of section  11-51-301,  11-51-401, or  11-51-501, a claim for damages under section  11-51-604 or restitution, disgorgement, or other equitable relief on behalf of some or all of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting the subject matter of the action, if the applicable scienter standard of section  11-51-604 is met. No person shall be liable for damages or for restitution, disgorgement, or other equitable relief in any action authorized by subsection (1) of this section for a violation of section  11-51-301 due solely to a failure to file the prescribed notification of exemption or to pay the required exemption fee for an exemption under section  11-51-308 (1)(p).

       No liability where offerees had equal access to information.
       Transactions by which defendant shareholder was issued all authorized common stock of corporate defendant and subsequently without filing registration statement caused corporate defendant to offer some of that stock to several different persons who were personal friends, acquaintances, or business associates of defendant, or president of corporate defendant, under restriction of first refusal agreement in favor of defendant where each of the offerees by virtue of their relationship had access to any information which would have been revealed by a registration statement, did not give rise to liability under statutes providing for registration of securities.

       A misrepresented or omitted fact is considered material
       under subsection (1) (now subsection (3)) if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the matter important in making an investment decision. Whether or not the misrepresentation or omitted fact is important turns on whether a reasonable investor would regard it as significantly altering the “total mix” of information made available.

       A prima facie case of control-person liability is established under subsection (5)(b) when the plaintiff demonstrates
       that (1) a primary violation of securities fraud occurred and (2) the defendant was a controlling person. As a general rule, a broker-dealer is statutorily in control of its registered representatives as a matter of law. When a broker is found to be a controlling person, liability is still subject to the broker-dealer’s affirmative defense of good faith. Houston v. Se. Invs. N.C., Inc.,

       A broker-dealer is not in statutory control of its registered representative’s underlying conduct when all the following factors are undisputed:
       (1) the plaintiff(s) did not reasonably rely on the registered representative’s relationship with the broker-dealer in making their investment; (2) the plaintiff(s) invested in markets other than those promoted by the broker-dealer; (3) the registered representative did not rely on its relationship with the broker-dealer to access the securities market in order to sell the subject securities to the plaintiff(s); and (4) the broker-dealer did not know of, or have a financial interest in, the investor’s business with the registered representative.

       Reckless or negligent conduct does not provide a legal basis for a claim of aiding and abetting under subsection (5)(c).

      </p>
      <p>
       The 1990 reenactment of the aiding and abetting provision is intended to limit aiding and abetting claims to those instances where
       the plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant had knowledge of the primary violation. Recklessness is no longer a sufficient basis for imposing liability. Stat-Tech Liquidating Trust v. Fenster, 981 F. Supp. 1325 (D.

       Subsection (8) is a substantive element of a securities claim that does not restrict the court’s jurisdiction and may be waived by the parties.

      <p>
       Waiving the statute of repose is not contrary to public policy when there is no contention that the agreement prompted plaintiff to delay investigation or wait for more favorable securities prices to bring suit, or that additional problems of proof developed.

       Summary judgment was appropriate for claim filed more than two years after stock purchase.

     Refunding public securities.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any public securities issued by the state, or any public body thereof, may be refunded, without an election, by the state or public body issuing them, or any successor thereof, in the name of the state or public body issuing the public securities being refunded, but subject to provisions concerning their payment and to any other contractual limitations in the proceedings authorizing their issuance or otherwise appertaining thereto, pursuant to an ordinance to be adopted by the governing body of the issuer in the manner provided by law for the issuance of the public securities being refunded, to refund, pay, and discharge all or any part of such outstanding public securities, including any interest thereon in arrears or about to become due, or for the purpose of reducing interest costs or effecting other economies, or of modifying or eliminating restrictive contractual limitations appertaining to the issuance of additional public securities, or to any project appertaining thereto or any combination thereof.

     Limitations upon issuance.
     </h3>
     <p>
      No public securities may be refunded under this article unless the holders thereof voluntarily surrender them for exchange or payment, or unless they either mature or are callable for prior redemption under their terms within ten years from the date of issuance of the refunding public securities. Provision shall be made for paying the public securities within said period of time. No maturity of any public security refunded may be extended over fifteen years, nor may the net effective interest rate of the issue of refunding securities be increased to any rate exceeding the maximum net effective interest rate authorized by the governing body. The principal amount of the refunding public securities may exceed the principal amount of the refunded public securities if the aggregate principal and interest costs of the refunding public securities do not exceed such unaccrued costs of the public securities refunded, except to the extent any interest on the public securities refunded in arrears or about to become due is capitalized with the proceeds of refunding public securities. The principal amount of the refunding public securities may also be less than or the same as the principal amount of the public securities being refunded so long as provision is duly and sufficiently made for their payment. The limitations of this section shall not apply to the refunding of public securities in order to avoid default.

       The proceeds of refunding public securities shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the public securities to be refunded or be placed in escrow in any state or national bank within the state which is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation to be applied to the payment of the public securities upon their presentation therefor; but, to the extent any incidental expenses have been capitalized, such security proceeds may be used to defray such expenses; and any accrued interest and any premium appertaining to a sale of refunding public securities may be applied to the payment of the interest thereon and the principal thereof, or both interest and principal, or may be deposited in a reserve therefor, as the governing body may determine.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-securities-ar54-s11-54-106ol12">
       No such escrow shall necessarily be limited to proceeds of refunding public securities but may include other moneys available for its purpose. Any escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested or reinvested in securities meeting the investment requirements established in part 6 of article 75 of title 24, C.R.S. Such escrowed proceeds and investments, together with any interest to be derived from any such investment, shall be in an amount at all times sufficient as to principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due, any charges of the escrow agent payable therefrom to pay the public securities being refunded as they become due at their respective maturities or due at designated prior redemption dates in connection with which the governing body of the issuer shall exercise a prior redemption option. No purchaser of any public security issued under this article shall in any manner be responsible for the application of the proceeds thereof by the issuer or any of its officers, agents, or employees.

     Payment of refunding public securities.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Refunding public securities may be made payable from any revenues derived from any utility, system, project, or other source which might be legally pledged for the payment of the public securities being refunded at the time of the refunding or at the time of the issuance of the public securities being refunded, as the governing body of the issuer may determine, notwithstanding the pledge of such revenues for the payment of the outstanding public securities being refunded is thereby modified; but there shall not be pledged for the payment of the refunding public securities any revenues which might not have been lawfully pledged for the payment of the public securities being refunded because of limitations in any question authorizing their issuance, unless the refunding public securities are similarly authorized at an election by the majority required by law for the issuance of the public securities being refunded.

       Public securities, including refunding public securities issued under this article and local district college revenue securities issued under the provisions of article 71 of title 23, C.R.S., shall bear interest at a rate such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of refunding public securities or local district college revenue securities does not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate authorized. Such interest shall be payable semiannually or annually and evidenced by one or two sets of coupons, if any, executed with the facsimile or manually executed signature of any official of the issuer; except that the first coupon appertaining to any public security may evidence interest not in excess of one year, and such securities may be in one or more series, may bear such date, may mature at such times not exceeding forty years from their respective dates, may be designated or redesignated, may be in such denomination, may be payable in such medium of payment and at such place within or without the state, including but not limited to the office of any county treasurer in which the issuer is located wholly or in part, may carry such registration privileges, may be subject to such terms of prior redemption in advance of maturity in such order or by lot or otherwise at such time with or without a premium, may be executed in such manner, may bear such privileges for reissuance in the same or other denominations, may be so reissued, without modification of maturities and interest rates, and may be in such form, either coupon or registered, as may be provided by ordinance of the governing body of the issuer. The governing body may provide for the subordination of the security of any public securities issued under this article and the payment of principal and interest thereon, to the extent deemed feasible and desirable by the governing body, to other public securities issued to finance facilities appertaining thereto or that may be outstanding when the public securities thus subordinated are issued and delivered.

      <li id="t11-securities-ar54-s11-54-111ol12">
       The public securities shall never be sold at less than ninety-five percent of the principal amount thereof and accrued interest thereon to the date of delivery, nor at a price which will result in a net effective interest rate to the issuer of more than the maximum net effective interest rate authorized by the governing body.

      Refunding bonds, other than special obligation refunding bonds, may be made payable from, and the governing body may pledge to the payment of such refunding bonds, any tax, or any income or revenue of the public body from any source, or both such taxes and such income or revenue, which could have been legally pledged to and used for the payment of the obligations being refunded at the time such obligations being refunded were issued or which could legally be pledged to and used for the payment of the obligations being refunded if the same were to be issued at the time of the refunding, as the governing body may determine, notwithstanding the pledge of such taxes, income or revenue for the payment of the outstanding obligations being refunded is thereby modified. In no event, however, shall any taxes, income, or revenues be pledged for the payment of any refunding bonds which could not have been lawfully pledged for the payment of the obligations being refunded because of the lack of the required approval of such pledge by the electors qualified to vote on the issuance of the obligations being refunded, or because of limitations in the election question authorizing their issuance, unless the refunding bonds and such pledge are similarly authorized by the electors at an election in substantially the manner required by law for the issuance of the obligations being refunded.

     Legislative declaration.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that, due to the changes in the public securities market and recent technological developments, it is important to provide public entities with the option to elect to apply the provisions of this part 2 when issuing securities. This part 2 will serve a public use and will promote the health, safety, security, and general welfare of the people of the state of Colorado. The general assembly intends for this part 2 to provide supplemental procedures for the issuance of securities otherwise authorized by law. However, nothing in this part 2 authorizes an issuing authority to waive an election otherwise required under section 20 of article X or article XI of the Colorado constitution or to hold an election inconsistent with the election requirements in section 20 of article X.

       An affirmative defense is waived unless it is presented at trial.
       Although defendant cited this section in its answer and in the trial management order, it did not raise the issue at trial. Because defendant did not cite this section at any point during trial or argue at trial that plaintiff’s claims were barred by this section, the affirmative defense was waived.

       The general assembly finds that:

        <li id="t11-publicsecurities-ar59-s11-59-102ol11a">
         The financial reputation and integrity of all local governments and political subdivisions are a matter of statewide concern;

        <li id="t11-publicsecurities-ar59-s11-59-102ol11b">
         There is a growing concern statewide with special districts and municipal and county improvement districts that are either insolvent or threatened with insolvency and the attendant impairment of viability and of the ability to provide public services; and
        </li>
        <li id="t11-publicsecurities-ar59-s11-59-102ol11c">
         The credit reputation of political subdivisions of the state of Colorado is of vital interest to citizens of the state.

      </li>
      <li id="t11-publicsecurities-ar59-s11-59-102ol12">
       The general assembly determines that it is necessary to empower the securities commissioner to regulate and monitor the issuance of municipal bonds of political subdivisions and to develop information and recommendations for appropriate action for the general assembly in connection therewith.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-publicsecurities-ar59-s11-59-102ol13">
       The general assembly declares that the annual disclosure of financial and credit information for public securities will benefit both issuers and investors by expanding and stabilizing the market for public securities and thereby improving the marketability of such securities.
      </li>
      <li id="t11-publicsecurities-ar59-s11-59-102ol14">
       Therefore, the general assembly declares that it is in the best interests of this state and its citizens that safeguards and full disclosure be made in connection with the issuance of bonds of special districts and municipal and county improvement districts and that this article is necessary to protect the continued provision of public services and the credit of political subdivisions. This article is remedial in nature and is to be broadly construed to effectuate its purposes.

       State statute on legal tender cannot prohibit acceptance of federal reserve notes because Congress has the power to declare what is legal tender for all debts and it has done so by delegation to the federal reserve system. Walton v. Keim, 694 P.2d 1287 (Colo. App. 1984).

     Title to property of trusts - liability of trust and trustees.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The trustees of trusts established pursuant to this article shall hold the legal title to all property at any time belonging to the trusts. They shall have control over such property, as well as the control and management of the business and affairs of the trust. Liability to third persons for any act, omission, or obligation of a trustee of a trust, when acting in such capacity, shall extend to the whole of the trust estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary to discharge such obligation, but no trustee shall be personally liable for any such act, omission, or obligation. The trustees shall have such powers as to the investment of the trust estate as may be set out in the declaration of trust, without regard to the type of investments to which trustees generally are restricted by the provisions of part 8 of article 1 of title 15, C.R.S., nor shall such trustees be subject to the provisions of title 10, C.R.S., concerning the regulation of insurance; except that the trustees shall report any malpractice claim against a licensed practitioner that is settled or in which judgment is rendered against the insured to the Colorado medical board, which board shall provide statistical data concerning such claims to the commissioner of insurance. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the trustees shall have any powers, whether conferred upon them by the agreement of trust or otherwise, to perform all acts necessary or desirable to the conduct of the business of a public liability insurer.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The charters of the state banks organized and existing prior to July 1, 2013, under the laws of this state continue in full force and effect. All such state banks, and, to the extent applicable, all banks chartered under the laws of another state and all national banks doing business in this state on or after July 1, 2013, are, from that date, subject to this article. Any such state bank, by filing an application under this code for an amendment of its charter or for a merger, consolidation, purchase and assumption, or sale of all, or substantially all, of its assets, or the assets of any department of such bank, shall be deemed to have expressly recognized that it is so subject.

       Quorum must be present to approve action of the banking board.
       The general assembly intended that any and all actions of the banking board may be approved at a meeting at which at least a quorum is present, and that any such action taken by a majority of the quorum shall be the action of the board. There are no exceptions to its applicability and therefore it governs all acts of the banking board, including the granting of a state bank charter. Peoples Bank v. Banking Bd., 164

       Banking board member is not disqualified from participating in consideration of issues

The banking board may determine the qualifications required for a person to be designated pursuant to this subsection (1) based upon the education and experience required for the particular hearing.

The banking board may extend such sixty-day period by no more than thirty additional days.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The state banking board may determine whether to grant bank charter
        and has jurisdiction to hold hearings to that effect. The district courts cannot usurp this power. Banking Bd. v. District Court, 177
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 77
        </cite>
        , 492 P.2d 837 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Board may use expertise which may not be disturbed by court.
        Convenience is only one of the factors the state banking board was entitled to consider in determining whether the proposed bank would serve a “public need and advantage” in the area. Other factors, such as the already highly competitive nature of banking in the area, outweighed the convenience factor. It was within the board’s competence, applying its expertise, to make this determination, and it should not be disturbed on review. Goldy v. Henry, 166
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 401
        </cite>
        , 443 P.2d 994 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court cannot affirm board’s order which exceeds statutory tolerances.
        Where the business location of a proposed bank as described in the banking board’s order exceeds the statutory tolerance and does not conform to the proposed location which was specified in the notice of hearing, the conclusion of law made by the district court that the banking board’s order was valid insofar as it described the possible location of the proposed bank was in error, and that portion of the district court’s judgment would be reversed. Academy Blvd. Bank v. Banking Bd., 30
        <cite class="cocode">
         Colo. App. 331, 492 P.2d 76
        </cite>
        (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court cannot disregard all evidence given to board by interested parties.
        In reversing the state banking board, the reviewing court disregarded virtually all of the evidence presented by the protesting banks, on the ground that only one of their witnesses was “neutral” or disinterested. Most of the applicants’ witnesses were as interested as the protestants’ witnesses. The fact that these witnesses had an interest in the outcome of the hearing may affect the weight to be given their opinions, but it does not require the board to assume that these witnesses were not telling the truth when they testified as to factual matters. Goldy v. Henry, 166
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 401
        </cite>
        , 443 P.2d 994 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is up to the board to weigh evidence.
        The weighing and evaluation of the testimony and evidence offered as to an application for a charter is the statutorily delegated power and responsibility of the banking board, and it is beyond the power of a reviewing court to substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finding authority. Academy Blvd. Bank v. Banking Bd., 30
        <cite class="cocode">
         Colo. App. 331, 492 P.2d 76
        </cite>
        (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also the board’s duty to determine the credibility of witnesses.
        The credibility of witnesses as well as the weight of the testimony are peculiarly within the province of the board to whom a statute entrusts the fact-finding process. When a conflict in the evidence exists, it is not within the power of a reviewing court to substitute its judgment for that of a fact-finding authority as to the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. Goldy v. Henry, 166
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 401

        IV. ORDER OF REVIEWING COURT.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Reviewing court may modify board’s order if basis for modification is on the record.
        Where the basis for modification of the banking board’s order appears in the record, the court may modify and correct that order on appeal. Academy Blvd. Bank v. Banking Bd., 30
        <cite class="cocode">

        </cite>
        (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides that the reviewing court may affirm the order of the board,
        direct the taking of any action deemed proper, or may reverse or modify the order of the banking board if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Banking Bd. v. Holyoke Indus. Bank, 152
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 489
        </cite>
        , 383 P.2d 318 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial evidence supporting the banking board’s finding of extraordinary circumstances
        where examinations of the bank over a period of five months revealed a continuing deterioration of its financial status, a negative capital assessment which continued to worsen over time, a failure of the bank to comply with the banking board’s order to levy an assessment, the insolvency of one of the bank’s major shareholders, and the bank’s inability to demonstrate the ability to secure an investor or otherwise inject the necessary capital in the immediate future. First Bank v. Dept. of Regulatory Agencies, 852 P.2d 1345 (Colo. App. 1993) (decided prior to 1989 repeal and reenactment).

        V. PROCEDURE.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Extent to which court of appeals governed by rules of civil procedure.
        Under this section, judicial proceedings to review the banking board determinations originate in the court of appeals. Therefore, to the extent that appellate rules are inadequate in this situation, the court of appeals is governed by the
        <cite class="cocode">

        Failure to join indispensable parties within statutory time for appeal is fatal defect.
        In an action in district courts to review administrative proceedings, failure to join indispensable parties prior to the expiration of the statutory time for appeal is a fatal defect which deprives the court of jurisdiction to entertain the action. Columbine State Bank v. Banking Bd., 34

       Loan omitted from report to deceive commissioner is void.
       Where a bank failed to report or publish a certain bank loan as required by this section and had it done so the commissioner would have closed the bank, the evident purpose of the loan then was to deceive the commissioner in his performance of an official duty. Such contracts are contrary to public policy and void. Walther v. McFerson, 92

       If the banking board has reason to believe that the capital of any bank is inadequate under the rules of the banking board, the banking board may ascertain the facts and furnish the bank with a copy of its determination. If the banking board determines an inadequacy of capital based upon such determination, the commissioner, with the approval of the banking board, may direct the state bank to levy an assessment in a designated amount upon the holders of record of common stock to remedy an inadequacy of capital. Upon receipt of an order to levy an assessment, the directors shall cause to be sent to all holders of common stock, at their addresses, a copy of the order and a copy of this subsection (1). If an assessment is not paid within the time prescribed in the order or such shorter period as the directors decide, but not less than thirty days, the state bank may, within sixty days thereafter as the banking board may prescribe in its order, offer the shares of the defaulting stockholders for sale at public auction or private sale at a price that shall not be less than the amount of the assessment and the cost of the sale. Any excess shall be paid to the prior owners. Except under circumstances where section  11-103-203 applies, the method of collection provided in this section shall be the sole method of collecting assessments. If an assessment is not paid within ninety days after the date of the order to levy or at such other date as may be specified in the order, but in no event less than thirty days, the commissioner may, with the approval of the banking board, proceed pursuant to part 8 of this article; however, for good cause shown to the banking board by the affected bank, the banking board may extend the ninety-day limit.

        The purpose of this section is to make good impaired capital
        and to permit an action to enforce payment of the assessment if necessary. Allen v. McFerson, 77

        Purpose is also to protect depositors and the general public.
        An assessment which the bank commissioner orders, and which the directors of the bank levy, is made for the purpose of protecting the bank’s depositors and in the interest of the public in general who might be induced to transact business with the bank. Lengel v. Commercial Bank, 87
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 331

        , 288 P. 174 (1930).

       <p>
        Fact that bank did make assessment is sufficient compliance with this section.
        Compliance with this section is sufficient where the pleadings and proof show that an assessment was in fact made by the officers of a bank. Allen v. McFerson, 77
        <cite class="co_code">

        Incorrect reports of directors do not bar collection of assessments.
        The fact that reports which bank directors made as to the condition of the bank appeared a number of years later to be incorrect, and that certain notes listed as assets were uncollectible or had become worthless, does not create an estoppel which bars the bank from collecting assessments ordered by the bank commissioner, and which were levied by its board of directors, if the same was found to be necessary, as it was, to protect depositors and creditors, and the public at large. Lengel v. Commercial Bank, 87

        Claim of fraud in purchase of bank stock cannot be urged as defense in action to collect an assessment.
        The claim on the part of a stockholder who was sued for an assessment made upon his stock, that he purchased the stock through fraud on the part of the officers of the bank, cannot be urged in an action to recover on the stockholder’s liability. Lengel v. Commercial Bank, 87

        Insufficient assessment does not alter stockholder’s statutory liability.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where assessment funds are not kept separate, etc., stockholders cannot claim a preference.
        Where the general finding of the court was that funds received by a bank from an assessment were not kept separate from other funds of the bank; that the funds were treated as other assets of the bank; that they were used as other money and property of the bank in the transaction of its daily business; and that it did not appear that any of that fund was used in the payment of the debts of the bank, the stockholders cannot claim a preference, nor that the assessment fund should be held available for the satisfaction of such claim. Neither should those stockholders, who paid their assessments, be given credit therefor on their statutory liability. Broadbent v. McFerson, 80

       <p>
        This fund, when paid in, could not, by any process of reasoning, become a liability of the bank;
        neither could the bank commissioner, nor the officers of the bank, change the character of that fund from an asset to a liability by an entry on the books of the bank. Broadbent v. McFerson, 80

        Assessment fund due bank, not creditors.

This section shall not be construed to affect in any way any recourse that such shareholder might otherwise have against those in whose names such shares appear upon the books of the bank at the time of such capital inadequacy.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section provides for double liability to be borne by four classes of persons:
        First, any shareholder of record on the books of the bank; second, any one who, though not appearing on the books as a shareholder, is an “owner of stock, legal or equitable”, but not “a person who holds the stock as collateral security for the payment of a debt”; third, any one who has transferred his stock within sixty days before the bank’s insolvency; and, fourth, any one who has transferred his stock with knowledge of the bank’s impending insolvency.

        The liability of stockholders of an insolvent bank is strictly statutory.

        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 253

       </p>
       <p>
        Liability cannot be extended beyond provisions of this section.
        Liability of stockholders in a banking corporation is undoubtedly a creature of statute. It does not exist at common law; hence it can be said that such liability, being statutory, cannot be extended beyond the plain purpose and intention of the statute. Buenz v. Cook, 15
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 38
        </cite>
        , 24 P. 679 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of liability is to provide a fund for the payment of the debts of the bank.
        McDonald v. McFerson, 80
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 4
        </cite>
        , 249 P. 496 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability is a contractual and not a penal liability.
        This liability, unlike the liability imposed by the statute upon directors or officers of a corporation for its debts, because of their fraud or negligence in the management of the affairs of the corporation, is not penal in its nature; it is a liability voluntarily assumed by the act of becoming a stockholder, and an obligation thus assumed is purely contractual, contains all the elements of a contract, and is to be enforced as such. Adams v. Clark, 36
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 65
        </cite>
        , 85 P. 642 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a bank could purchase its own stock, this liability could be avoided,
        its capital depleted, and there would be no security to the depositors except in the bank itself. Kassler v. Kyle, 28
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 374

        , 65 P. 34 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Party assuming to act as stockholder cannot escape liability.
        A party who assumes to act in the capacity and exercise the rights of a stockholder, attends meetings, and, after the bank is closed by the bank commissioner, joins with others to salvage the concern cannot be heard to deny his character as a stockholder when charged as such under this section. Bundy v. Wilson, 66
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 253
        </cite>
        , 180 P. 740 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a person holds no stock in a banking corporation, in any capacity, but is nevertheless elected a member of the board of directors, files his oath as such and accepts the office of president, he will not, on the failure of the bank, escape the statutory liability. Swenson v. McFerson, 91
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 519
        </cite>
        , 17 P.2d 530 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The liability of the stockholders being several,
        it was not essential that all should have been included in the same judgment. The court was empowered, after rendering judgment against the defendant stockholders, who had been served or had appeared, to continue the cause, for the purpose of acquiring jurisdiction of the persons or property of the others, who were named in the decree as being nonresidents but not served, in order that complete relief might be administered with respect to the subject of the cause. Toll v. Cobbey, 22 Colo. App. 244, 124 P. 357 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stockholders may not set off their deposits against their statutory liability
        since this would make stockholders who are depositors preferred creditors against the fund, and, in a measure, defeat its purpose. McDonald v. McFerson, 80

        Bank commissioner filing statement claiming lien has same standing as judgment creditor.
        There is no substantial reason why the same rule that applies to a judgment creditor who, without notice of unrecorded conveyance, files a transcript of his judgment and whose lien is thereby superior to the grantee in the deed, should not be applied in favor of a bank commissioner who files a statement claiming a statutory lien under this section.

       Public need and advantage.
       The purpose of a similar requirement, i.e., a finding that the industrial bank “will promote the convenience and advantage of the community” is to protect prospective depositors and other creditors in their dealings with the bank and not to protect competitors.

      <p>
       The board seems to have determined the “public need and advantage” to be synonymous with “so long as existing institutions are not affected by additional competition”. Such construction is contrary to the law, for competition may benefit the public by causing protestant banks to review their policies, increase interest rates on deposits, and even augment their service to the community in which they do business.

       The nature of competition in banking in the area may be considered.
       Other factors, such as the already highly competitive nature of banking in the area, outweighed the convenience factor. It was within the board’s competence, applying its expertise, to make this determination, and it should not be disturbed on review. Goldy v. Henry, 166

       Board may not approve application which shows violation of branch bank prohibition.
       The procedure for incorporating a new bank, the proposed operation of the new bank, and the basis upon which the charter for the new bank was granted met with the approval of the banking board which was fully apprised of all the facts concerning the common ownership of stock, the common directors, and the other facts concerning the relationship between the two banks. None of the facts as shown from the record, necessarily and as a matter of law, reveal that the banking board’s grant of the state charter to the applicant bank is in violation of the prohibition against branch banking.

       Court may not speculate on future violation of law.
       Where it would be necessary for the court to speculate that, after issuance of the bank’s charter, the applicants and the bank would thereafter proceed to act in direct violation of applicable federal laws, such speculation by the court would be contrary to the settled legal principle that it is precluded from deciding abstract or contingent questions.

       Board, not court, weighs and evaluates evidence.
       The weighing and evaluation of the testimony and evidence offered as to an application for a charter is the statutorily delegated power and responsibility of the banking board, and it is beyond the power of a reviewing court to substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finding authority.

       Where the inferences to be drawn from evidence are conflicting, the reviewing court may not displace an administrative agency’s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.

       The affairs of a state bank shall be managed by a board of directors, which shall exercise its powers and be responsible for the discharge of its duties. The number of directors, not fewer than three nor more than twenty-five, shall be as fixed by the bylaws, and the number so fixed shall be the board, regardless of vacancies. At least three-fourths of the directors shall be citizens of the United States, and a majority shall be residents of this state. A director need not own shares. No director may serve who has been convicted of fraud involving any financial institution or of a felony, but the banking board may waive this provision regarding a felony if it determines that the particular felony does not jeopardize the person’s ability to act as a director. A director who is disqualified may be removed by the board of directors or by the banking board. No action taken by a director prior to his or her resignation or removal shall be subject to attack on the ground of his or her disqualification.

       Directors shall be elected by the stockholders at the first meeting, and thereafter, at the annual meeting or at a special meeting called for the purpose. If the charter provides for cumulative voting, the votes of each share may be cast for one person or divided among two or more, as the stockholder may choose. The person (to the number of directors to be elected) having the largest number of votes shall be elected.

      <li id="t11-coloradobankingcode-ar103-p05-s11-103-501ol14">
       The term of office of directors shall be one year. Vacancies may be filled by vote of the board of directors until the next meeting of the stockholders.

       A director may be removed by the stockholders at a meeting. Where cumulative voting for directors is provided in the charter, no director shall be removed unless the votes cast against a motion for his or her removal are less than the total number of shares outstanding divided by the number of authorized directors, but all of the directors shall be removed if a majority of the outstanding shares approves a motion for the removal of all.

       The officers designated by the bylaws shall be elected by the board of directors. A member of the board of directors shall be elected president. No officer shall be elected for a period longer than one year. No person may be employed as an officer of a state bank who has been convicted of fraud involving any financial institution or of a felony, but the banking board may waive this provision regarding a felony if it determines that the particular felony does not jeopardize the person’s ability to act as an officer. An officer may be removed by the board of directors at any time, but removal shall not prejudice any rights that the officer may have to damages for breach of contract of employment, unless the officer falsely answered any question or made any material misstatement of facts relating to any matter leading to or constituting any inducement to such employment.

       This section assures responsibility of directors.
       One of the purposes of this section is that only a person substantially interested should be entrusted with the control of the business of a bank. Another is that a director should be able to respond in something more than a nominal amount in case of failure of business, for which failure he was, in part, in law, responsible. Swenson v. McFerson, 91

       The board of directors of a state bank shall meet at least once each calendar quarter, unless the banking board directs that meetings be held on a more frequent basis, or a less frequent basis in the case of disaster or emergency. The banking board, the commissioner, or an executive officer may call a special meeting. A majority of the board of directors constitutes a quorum. The board shall keep minutes of each meeting, including a record of attendance. Any director who fails to attend meetings of the board of directors for three consecutive months automatically ceases to be a director, unless the absence is satisfactorily explained to the banking board or the commissioner, who shall, in that event, notify the president of the bank of the approval of the continuation of the director.

Any committee so designated shall keep minutes of its meetings and report at each monthly meeting of the board of directors all action taken since the previous meeting of the board. The board of directors shall designate one or more committees of not less than three qualified officers or directors to supervise the investment of fiduciary funds. No such investment of any account for which the bank has investment discretionary authority shall be made, retained, or disposed of without the approval of a board-approved committee as to which the bank has investment or review responsibility. At least once in every calendar year, the committee shall review the records of each fiduciary account as to which the bank has investment or review responsibility and shall determine the current value, safety, and suitability of the investments and whether the investments should be modified or retained. The committee shall keep minutes of its meetings and shall report at each monthly meeting of the board of directors its conclusions on all questions considered and all action taken since the previous meeting of the board. The board of directors shall establish the policies and procedures necessary for the proper exercise of fiduciary powers by the state bank and in accordance with any rule established by the banking board.

     Preapproved shelf charter.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board may preapprove a shelf charter for a new bank to qualified individuals, contingent upon the new bank completing all specified requirements and purchasing the assets and assuming the liabilities of a bank in receivership as the federal deposit insurance corporation may determine, if the proposed bank has its principal place of business in Colorado and has assets and liabilities held in receivership by the federal deposit insurance corporation. The shelf charter may be preapproved and summarily issued without publication of a notice, without the holding of a public hearing, and without complying with all of the other provisions and procedures specified in this code. Upon federal deposit insurance corporation approval of the purchase and assumption by the new bank, the final charter approval may be granted, together with final approval of deposit insurance by the federal deposit insurance corporation. If the bid is not accepted by the federal deposit insurance corporation, the charter remains on the shelf for up to eighteen months. During that time, the charter may be used for other bids.

       This section clearly prohibits banks from conducting business at more than one location.
       It likewise implies that the duly granted charter of a bank cannot be used as a grant of authority to do business at more than the single place of business. Hence, it is also implied that an approved bank having a duly granted charter cannot apply for another charter to do business under a second charter at a second place of business. Peoples Bank v.

       If banks do business as one, then they are branches.
       To establish that a bank is a branch it must be shown, that, in substance, one is doing business through the instrumentality of the other, or vice versa, in the same way as if the institutions were one. Peoples Bank v. Banking Bd., 164

       The general assembly did intend to permit what is known as “affiliate banks”,
       whereby, for example, modern and progressive bookkeeping and accounting procedures may be employed by “smaller” banks through the contractual use of facilities of a “larger” bank, thus reducing overhead costs to both the smaller and the larger banks and thereby passing along larger profits to stockholders and less expensive charges to customers without the abuses, risks, and problems of supervision often involved in branch banking.

       Reduction of capital stock and distribution of assets thus received is sale of own stock to bank.
       Where a bank reduced its capital stock by one-half and distributed assets of the bank amongst the stockholders equal to one-half the par value of the original stock, such a transaction was in effect a sale of one-half of the capital stock of the bank to itself, which is prohibited by law except in specified instances, and its agreement to pay for such stock is therefore in violation of its charter powers and cannot be enforced to the detriment of the rights of general creditors. Kassler v. Kyle, 28

       A cashier selling stock in a bank to such bank is liable for misappropriation of funds.
       Where the cashier of a bank handed in his resignation before the sale of stock in the bank to the bank, this was a mere subterfuge resorted to for the purpose of apparently changing his relations with the bank and he is therefore liable for the misappropriation of the assets of the bank to which he was a party in his official capacity independent of the ownership of the stock transferred. United Sec. Co. v. Ostenberg, 60
       <cite class="co_code">
        Colo. 249

      <p>
       Where a bank put it in the power of the cashier to carry out a deal prohibited by this section, it should bear the loss,
       if he committed a wrong and damaged the defendant by improper methods, purporting to act in his official capacity. The bank should bear the loss rather than an innocent outsider, who undoubtedly had faith in the cashier because of his relations to the bank. Commercial Bank & Trust Co. v. Beach, 66

       The general assembly finds, determines, and declares that distinctions in function and services of various types of financial institutions have become so narrow that organizational and operational equality should be encouraged and facilitated in this state. It is the intent of the general assembly to enact legislation that will promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions for the benefit of the public, improve efficiency for the economic operation of those financial institutions, and ensure that the state of Colorado, by its appropriate action, will continue its control of those financial institutions within its jurisdiction.

      , C.R.S., a Colorado bank or trust company may invest and reinvest the assets that it maintains in its trust in the securities of any open-end or closed-end management investment company or investment trust registered under the federal “Investment Company Act of 1940”, 15 U.S.C. sec. 80a-1 et seq., as amended. A Colorado bank or trust company shall be allowed to make such investment even if it exercises investment discretion as a fiduciary, custodian, managing agent, or otherwise with respect to the investment and reinvestment of assets that it maintains in its trust department. The fact that a Colorado bank or trust company, or any affiliate thereof, is providing services to the investment company or trust as investment advisor, sponsor, distributor, custodian, transfer agent, registrar, or otherwise, and receiving reasonable remuneration for the services, does not preclude such bank or trust company from investing in the securities of such investment company or trust.

       </p>
       <p>
        Section is valid under the federal constitution.
        This section as originally found in
        <cite class="co_law">
         L. 1885, p. 50
        </cite>
        , was held not within the class of legislation prohibited by the provisions of the federal constitution. When the law applies to all persons engaged in a certain occupation or business, and each one is without distinction amenable to its provisions solely because he pursues such occupation or business, it is then “binding upon all persons of the community under similar circumstances”. Robertson v. People, 20
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 279
        </cite>
        , 38 P. 326 (1894).

       <p>
        It is not essential to a conviction that the president of a bank should assent to a particular deposit,
        or that he should have acquiesced in its reception after he obtained actual knowledge that it had been made. McClure v. People, 27
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 358
        </cite>
        , 61 P. 612 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an officer and director of a bank with authority to instruct the employees as to what they should and should not do remains silent, it is mere sophistry to say that he did not assent to the reception of deposits, even when made in his absence, when as a reasonable man he knew they would be received by the employees if presented. Woolsey v. People, 98

        II. NECESSITY FOR INTENT OR KNOWLEDGE.
       </h5>
       <p>
        An intent to violate the provisions of this section must be shown.
        Under this section a director of a bank may not be held liable, either civilly or criminally, for a violation of the provisions of the statute unless the evidence shows that he intended to violate its provisions. Goldsworthy v. Anderson, 92
        <cite class="co_code">

        , 21 P.2d 718 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary that a specific intent to defraud or harm
        a depositor should be shown on the part of defendant, or that defendant had actual knowledge of the insolvency of the bank, if his ignorance of its insolvency was due to his own criminal negligence. McClure v. People, 27
        <cite class="co_code">
         Colo. 358

       <p>
        Intentional absence by officer will not exempt him from liability.
        An officer of a bank cannot exempt himself from criminal liability under this section by intentionally absenting himself from the bank and abstaining from participation in its management, and purposely neglecting to avail himself of means of information as to its financial condition, or by showing that if he had given attention to its business, on account of his ignorance of banking methods he would not have been able to ascertain its true condition.

       This section places embezzlement by bankers in a special class.
       It was the clear intention of the general assembly to withdraw from the operation of the earlier and general act of 1907 the crime of embezzlement by bankers, and place it in a special class by itself. This being true, it follows that, so far as bankers are concerned, this provision supersedes and impliedly repeals the act of 1907. Cliff v. People, 84

      </p>
      <p>
       It is only when specific intent exists
       that an act comes within the provisions of this section; hence, where abstraction or misapplication is charged, it is necessary to allege such specific intent. Cliff v. People, 84

Upon receipt of an order to levy an assessment, the directors shall cause to be sent to all holders of common stock, at their addresses, a copy of the order and a copy of this subsection (2).

Any excess shall be paid to the prior owners. The method of collection provided in this subsection (2) shall be the sole method of collecting assessments.

     <p>
      In addition to powers regarding liquidation, the banking board may, in the interest of protecting the public and the depositors of a closed trust company with its principal office in this state, issue a new trust company charter to qualified individuals for the same location as the closed trust company, contingent upon the new trust company assuming full liability for such deposits of the closed trust company as may be transferred to it. Under such conditions, a new charter may be issued summarily without the publication of notice, without the holding of a public hearing, and without complying with any of the other provisions and procedures specified in this article.

     Appeals procedure.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any trust company aggrieved and directly affected by an order or rule of the banking board, issued under this article, may seek a review in the district court of this state in and for the county in which the trust company is located, within thirty days after receipt of written notice of the issuance of such order or rule. The filing of such a petition for review shall not, of itself, stay enforcement of an order or rule, but the court, upon a finding that irreparable injury would otherwise result, may order a stay upon such terms as it deems proper. The court may affirm the order of the banking board or may direct said banking board to take any action deemed proper. No person shall be subjected to any civil or criminal liability for any act or omission made in good faith reliance upon a then existing order or rule of the banking board, notwithstanding a subsequent decision by a court invalidating the order or rule.

     Legislative declaration.
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of this state that checks, drafts, money orders, or other instruments for the transmission or payment of credit or money are widely used by the people of this state as a process of settling accounts or debts and that sellers and issuers of the instruments receive, in the aggregate, large sums of money from the people of this state and it is therefore imperative that the integrity, experience, and financial responsibility and reliability of those engaged in the various types of businesses dealing in the instruments be above reproach. In order that the people of this state may be safeguarded from default in the payment of these instruments, it is necessary that proper regulatory authority be established through the banking board. Any person who sells or issues the instruments without complying with the provisions of this article 110 endangers the public interest.
