         Subsection (3)(a) is constitutional, does not violate the home rule amendment to the Colorado Constitution, and prevails over municipality’s zoning ordinance as applied to landowner.
        </b>
        Subsection (3)(a) enforces constitutionally protected property rights and prohibits the unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation. Constitutionally protected property interests are a matter of statewide concern and must be treated uniformly throughout the state. While zoning regulations are typically a matter of local concern, subsection (3)(a) is not a zoning regulation. Rather, it prohibits the unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.

         Because inalienable property rights are involved, both local and state concerns are implicated, and the constitution cannot be read to dictate the matter at issue as one of exclusively local concern.

        Although the amortization of sexually oriented businesses in a municipality may result in those businesses relocating to neighboring municipalities, there is no showing that this possibility will seriously impact residents outside the municipality. Thus, extraterritorial impact of zoning ordinance is not substantial. Although zoning regulations generally have little extraterritorial impact and are traditionally a matter of local concern, in consideration of the legislative declaration respecting subsection (3)(a) and the importance of protecting constitutionally based property rights, preventing the taking of private property without just compensation is a matter of statewide or, at least, mixed concern.

         The condemnation by a home rule municipality of property outside its territorial boundaries for open space and park purposes falls within the scope of the eminent domain power granted to such municipalities in this article.
        </b>
        The eminent domain power granted to home rule municipalities in this article is not limited to the purposes specified in this section nor is the eminent domain power circumscribed when exercised extraterritorially. Rather, this article grants home rule municipalities the power to condemn property, within or outside of territorial limits, for any lawful, public, local, and municipal purpose. The extraterritorial condemnation of property need not be pursuant to a purpose that is purely local and municipal. As long as the condemnation is based on a lawful, public, local, and municipal purpose, it does not fall outside of the scope of this article merely because it potentially implicates competing state interests. Based upon statutory provisions authorizing statutory localities to condemn land for open space, parks, and recreation, as well as the traditional exercise of this power by the state’s statutory and home rule municipalities, the extraterritorial condemnation of property for open space and parks is a lawful, public, local, and municipal purpose within the scope of this article. The condemnation of the landowner’s property outside the territorial boundaries of the municipality was, therefore, lawful. Town of Telluride v. San Miguel Valley Corp.,185 P.3d 161 (Colo. 2008).

        Accordingly, the statutory provision is unconstitutional with respect to home rule municipalities. Court’s inquiry need not extend beyond the question of whether the statute purports to deny home rule municipalities powers specifically granted by the constitution. No analysis of competing state and local interests is necessary where a statute purports to take away home rule powers granted by the constitution. The legislature cannot prohibit the exercise of constitutional home rule powers regardless of the state interests that may be implicated by the exercise of those powers. Town of Telluride v. San Miguel Valley Corp.,185 P.3d 161 (Colo. 2008).

        Subsection (4)(b) curtails the condemnation power in this article by limiting it to the enumerated purposes in this section and also by removing certain enumerated purposes from the list. Accordingly, subsection (4)(b) is an unconstitutional abrogation of the powers granted to home rule municipalities under this article. The general assembly has no power to enact a law that denies a right specifically granted by the constitution. Town of Telluride v. San Miguel Valley Corp.,185 P.3d 161 (Colo. 2008).

        Whether a comparable sale is sufficiently similar to be of probative value in determining the value of land taken is for the trial court or commission to determine in its discretion.

The record also supports a finding that criteria outlined by the American institute of real estate appraisers for use of the land residual method were met. In upholding the use of the land residual method, court of appeals rejected city’s arguments that use of this method impermissibly considers a speculative or prospective value, that income and profits from a waste transfer station could not be considered in valuing the land, and that use of this method violated the undivided basis rule.

        <b>
         Types of property subject to condemnation unlimited.

         Using or enlarging ditch without owner’s consent considered taking.
        </b>
        Using or enlarging a ditch, without the owner’s consent, was a taking or damaging of private property as would be appropriating the right-of-way therefor, in the first instance, but such taking or damaging could not be tolerated except upon payment, in a constitutional manner, of just compensation. Tripp v. Overocker, 7 Colo. 72, 1 P. 695 (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Cemetery lands subject to condemnation.
        </b>
        Cemetery lands, by virtue of their sacred nature, are not placed beyond the reach of the power of eminent domain; however, in the case of public cemeteries, such power to condemn must be given expressly or by necessary and reasonable implication. Beth Medrosh Hagodol v. City of Aurora, 126 Colo. 267, 248 P.2d 732 (1952).

        <b>
         Condemnor acquires surface and support of surface.
        </b>
        When land is acquired by condemnation for a highway, the condemnor acquires not only what is understandably known as just the surface, but, by virtue of such condemnation, it acquires whatever is necessary for the support of that surface. Russell Coal Co. v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 129 Colo. 330, 270 P.2d 772 (1954).

       <p>
        <b>
         Where overwhelming necessity shown.
        </b>
        Where land is already devoted to a public use, it would be wholly unreasonable to permit it to be taken for another public use which would nullify and defeat the one to which it is already devoted, except in cases where the overwhelming necessities of the public were such that in order to serve their needs or supply their necessities, the taking of such property became necessary. Beth Medrosh Hagodol v. City of Aurora, 126 Colo. 267, 248 P.2d 732 (1952).

Record fails to clarify condemnor’s intended use of the property or size of the planned road with sufficient specificity to allow trial court to analyze necessity of requested easement. Condemnor’s failure to sufficiently articulate development plan prevented trial court from determining scope of proposed condemnation sufficiently to determine scope of burden to be imposed upon the property to be condemned. Given evidentiary shortcomings in the record, trial court correctly concluded that it could not determine whether particular way of necessity requested by condemnor was indispensable and, therefore, trial court correctly denied condemnor’s request for immediate possession and dismissed the condemnation petition.

The court shall hear proofs and allegations of all parties interested touching the regularity of the proceedings and shall rule upon all objections thereto. Unless a jury is requested by the owner of the property as provided in section 38-1-106, the court shall appoint a board of commissioners of not less than three disinterested and impartial freeholders to determine compensation in the manner provided in this article to be allowed to the owner and persons interested in the lands, real estate, claims, or other property proposed to be taken or damaged in such county for the purposes alleged in the petition. The court shall fix the time and place for the first meeting of such commissioners. Such meeting shall be held at least thirty days prior to the date scheduled for the trial to determine compensation. At the meeting, a voir dire examination shall be conducted by the court and the parties to determine whether the proposed commissioners are disinterested and impartial freeholders. If the court determines that any of the proposed commissioners is not disinterested and impartial, the court shall replace such person and appoint another commissioner, who shall also be subject to voir dire examination. At the hearing to determine compensation, the court shall administer an oath to the commissioners, shall instruct them in writing as to their duties, and, at the conclusion of the testimony, shall instruct them in writing as to the applicable and proper law to be followed by them in arriving at their ascertainment. The court shall fix reasonable compensation for the services and expenses of said commissioners and shall provide the services of a court reporter to record all proceedings had by the commissioners.

The commissioners may request the court or clerk thereof to issue subpoenas to compel witnesses to attend the proceedings and testify as in other civil cases and may adjourn and hold meetings for that purpose. They may request the court to make rulings upon the propriety of the proof or objections of the parties. They shall hear the proofs and allegations of the parties according to the rules of evidence and, after viewing the premises or other property and without fear, favor, or partiality, shall ascertain and certify the proper compensation to be made to said owner or parties interested for the lands, real estate, claims, or other property to be taken or affected, as well as all damages accruing to the owner or parties interested in consequence of the condemnation of the same. The commissioners shall make, subscribe, and file with the clerk of the court in which such proceedings are had a certificate of their ascertainment and assessment, in which such lands, real estate, claims, or other property shall be described with convenient certainty and accuracy.

If there is more than one person interested as owner or otherwise in the property and they are unable to agree upon the nature, extent, or value of their respective interests in the total amount of compensation so ascertained and assessed on an undivided basis by either a commission or a jury, the nature, extent, or value of said interests shall thereupon be determined according to law in a separate and subsequent proceeding and distribution made among the several claimants thereto.

       Upon the entry of such rule, the petitioner shall become seized in fee unless a lesser interest has been sought, except as provided in this section, of all such lands, real estate, claims, or other property described in said rule as required to be taken, and may take possession and hold and use the same for the purposes specified in such petition, and shall thereupon be discharged from all claims for any damages by reason of any matter specified in such petition, certificate, or rule of said court. No right-of-way or easement acquired by condemnation shall ever give the petitioner any right, title, or interest to any vein, ledge, lode, deposit, oil, natural gas, or other mineral resource found or existing in the premises condemned, except insofar as the same may be required for subsurface support.

      <li id="t38a01p01s38-1-105ol15">
       If at any time after an attempted or actual ascertainment of compensation under this article or any purchase or by donation to said petitioner of any lands, real estate, claims, or other property for purposes specified in the petition it appears that the title acquired thereby, to all or any part of such lands for the use of such petitioner, is defective or if said assessment fails or is deemed defective, the petitioner may proceed and perfect such title by procuring an ascertainment of the proper compensation to be made to any person who has title, claim, or interest in or lien upon such lands, real estate, claims, or other property and by making payment thereof in the manner provided in section 38-1-112, as near as may be.

The court wherein any such proceedings are had shall determine the amount such petitioner is required to pay or deposit pending any such ascertainment. In every case where possession is so authorized, it is lawful for either party to conduct the proceedings to a conclusion, if the same are delayed by the other party.

         Upon proper application to the court or by stipulation between the parties, the owner may withdraw from the sum so deposited an amount not to exceed three-fourths of the highest valuation evidenced or testimony presented by the petitioner at the hearing for possession, unless the petitioner agrees to a larger withdrawal, if all parties interested in the property sought to be acquired consent and agree to such withdrawal. Any such withdrawal of said deposit shall be a partial payment of the amount of total compensation to be paid and shall be deducted by the clerk of the court from any award or verdict entered thereafter.

         Since landowner’s action for damages improper for consideration in condemnation proceedings.
        </b>
        The procedural requirement of the landowner having to seek recovery in a separate action arose from the fact that condemnor, after abandoning and discontinuing the proceedings, was relegated to the status of a trespasser ab initio, and the landowner’s action for damages, of necessity, had to sound in tort and involved essentials, both in the pleading and trial thereof, not properly subjects for consideration in condemnation proceedings under this section.

        <b>
         Issues pertaining to the government’s right to take immediate possession of condemned property are properly part of eminent domain proceedings.
        </b>
        Because the trial court had jurisdiction to decide issues pertaining to the department of transportation’s right to take immediate possession of the property, it necessarily follows that the trial court also had jurisdiction to accept, interpret, and enforce a stipulation which resolved the dispute over such possession. Dept. of Transp. v. Auslaender, 94 P.3d 1239 (Colo. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Although an eminent domain valuation commission is empowered to make evidentiary rulings without consulting the supervisory judge, the judge’s evidentiary rulings control and are binding on the commission.
        </b>
        This remains true whether the judge rules on the evidentiary issue presented before or after the commission considers its admissibility. Reg’l Transp. Dist. v. 750 W. 48th Ave., LLC, 2015 CO 57, 357 P.3d 179.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the judge has not ruled on the evidence, then the commission may do so without consulting her. But the judge is still the judge. Under § 38-1-101 (2)(a), she is charged with deciding all questions and issues except the amount of compensation, and the commission must operate within the bounds of the judge’s supervisory authority. Therefore, any implicit power in the commission to decide evidentiary rulings is necessarily subsidiary to judicial rulings and the commission has no power to alter those rulings unilaterally. This remains true even when the judicial rulings are made in limine. Reg’l Transp. Dist. v. 750 W. 48th Ave., LLC, 2015 CO 57, 357 P.3d 179.

        <b>
         Questions for determination by court include:
        </b>
        (1) Whether or not the petitioner belongs to the class of persons entitled to condemn; (2) whether or not the property sought to be taken belongs to the class of property that is subject to condemnation; (3) whether or not the purpose for which the property is sought to be taken is one for which condemnation is permitted; (4) whether or not the petitioner and the owner have been able to come to an agreement concerning a purchase of the land; and (5) whether or not the act authorizing the proceeding is constitutional. Pine Martin Mining Co. v. Empire Zinc Co., 90 Colo. 529, 11 P.2d 221 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Court must determine necessity and purpose of taking land.
        </b>
        The question of the necessity of taking land and property from the owner and the question as to whether or not the purpose for which the property is to be taken is a public one are questions which the court must answer because the correct answers are conditioned by rules of law of which the commissioners cannot have competent knowledge. Union P.R.R. v. Colo. Postal Tel. Cable Co., 30 Colo. 133, 69 P. 564 (1902), appeal dismissed, 191 U.S. 577, 24 S. Ct. 861, 48 L. Ed. 309 (1903).

       </p>
       <p>
        Since a right-of-way shall not give the party condemning it any right, title, or interest to any vein, ledge, lode, or deposit in the premises so taken, the question of whether the petitioners were precluded from running a tunnel is a matter which, if proper to consider in condemnation proceedings, must be settled by the court. Colo. Fuel &amp; Iron Co. v. Four Mile Ry., 29 Colo. 90, 66 P. 902 (1901).

         Feasibility or financial success of enterprise not determinations for court in limine.
        </b>
        Whether or not an enterprise is feasible or will be a financial success cannot be inquired into even by commissioners charged with the duty of determining the question of necessity for the project, and clearly such questions were not for the determination of the court in limine. Rothwell v. Coffin, 122 Colo. 140, 220 P.2d 1063 (1950).

         Nothing in subsection (1) purports to preclude a court from making determination before trial on the legal question of whether the phrase “private ways of necessity” includes ways for natural gas pipelines.

        This legal question is distinguished from factual question of necessity, that is, whether the way sought is “reasonably necessary” under the facts and circumstances of the case, which is one for the trier of fact. Akin v. Four Corners Encampment, 179 P.3d 139 (Colo. App. 2007).

       When the jury has been selected and the jurors have taken an oath faithfully and impartially to discharge their duties, the court, at the request of any party to the proceeding and in the discretion of the court, may order that the jury go upon the premises sought to be taken or damaged, in charge of a sworn bailiff, and examine the premises in person. Such order shall require the party making such request to advance a sum, to be fixed by the court in such order, sufficient in the opinion of the court to defray the necessary expenses of such examination. In default of such party forthwith advancing such sum, such order shall be held for naught upon such trial before a jury. The court shall preside in the same manner and with like powers as in other cases. Evidence shall be admitted or rejected by the court according to the rules of law. At the conclusion of the evidence, the matters in controversy may be argued by counsel to the jury. At the conclusion of the arguments, the court shall instruct the jury in writing. The jury shall retire for deliberation, in charge of a sworn officer, and when they have agreed upon a verdict the same shall be returned into court.

Any party feeling aggrieved by such verdict may move before such court for a new trial in the same manner and for the same causes as in actions at law. The refusal of such court to grant a new trial may be excepted to and assigned for appeal.

     <p>
      In cases in which compensation is ascertained, if the owner of the property taken or affected prosecutes an appeal as provided by law and the Colorado appellate rules, the petitioner may pay into court or to the clerk thereof the amount of compensation ascertained and awarded for the use of the owner and shall thereupon be entitled to take possession and use the property taken or affected the same as if no such appeal had been taken. The money so deposited shall remain on deposit until such appeal has been heard and determined. If the owner elects to receive such money before the determination of said appeal, the appeal shall thereupon be dismissed so far as such owner is concerned. If the appeal is taken by the petitioner, the amount of compensation shall nevertheless be paid into court or to the clerk thereof for the use of the owner of the property condemned or affected before such petitioner has the right to take possession of and use said property so condemned or affected. Such compensation may be paid to such owner, at any time before the determination of such appeal, upon the execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond by such owner with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by said court, in a sum double the amount of such compensation, conditioned that such owner will pay and refund to such petitioner all or such part of said sum as said owner may be required or adjudged to pay said petitioner, together with the cost of said appeal.

       <p>
        An inverse condemnation action is in the nature of a special statutory proceeding and is to be tried as if it were an eminent domain proceeding. Thus, the exemplary damages statute, which authorizes the award of exemplary damages in “all civil actions”, is not applicable to an inverse condemnation action. Ossman v. Mtn. States Tel. &amp; Tel.

         III. DAMAGES TO RESIDUE OF PROPERTY.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Measure of damages to residue is diminuation of market value.
        </b>
        The measure of damages to the residue of property after an eminent domain taking is the diminution of the market value by reason of the taking. W. Slope Gas Co. v. Lake Eldora Corp., 32 Colo. App. 293, 512 P.2d 641 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Damages are awarded equal to the actual diminution of its market value, if any, for any use to which the same may reasonably be put. City of Denver v. Bayer, 7 Colo. 113, 2 P. 6 (1883); Colo. Cent. R.R. v. Allen, 13 Colo. 229, 22 P. 605 (1889); Denver &amp; R.G.R.R. v. Griffith, 17 Colo. 598, 31 P. 171 (1892); Roberts v. Scurvin Ditch Co., 22 Colo. App. 120, 125 P. 552 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Damage to the residue after land taken is to be measured by the present difference between market value before and after taking, and includes all damages from the natural, necessary, and reasonable result of the taking. Mack v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 152 Colo. 300, 381 P.2d 987 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        All damages, present and prospective, that are the natural, necessary, or reasonable result of the taking should be assessed, except such as may arise from negligent or unskillful construction. Denver City Irrigation &amp; Water Co. v. Middaugh, 12 Colo. 434, 21 P. 565 (1889); Loloff v. Sterling, 31 Colo. 102, 71 P. 113 (1903); Farmers’ Reservoir &amp; Irrigation Co. v. Cooper, 54 Colo. 402, 130 P. 1004 (1913); Moffat v. City &amp; County of Denver, 57 Colo. 473, 143 P. 577 (1914); Mulford v. Farmers’ Reservoir &amp; Irrigation Co., 62 Colo. 167, 161 P. 301 (1916).

        <b>
         Damage to residue includes
        </b>
        all damages from the natural, necessary, and reasonable result of the taking. Mack v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 152 Colo. 300, 381 P.2d 987 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a portion of a parcel of land is taken from a property owner in a condemnation proceeding, the landowner is entitled to recover all damages that are the natural, necessary, and reasonable result of the taking, as measured by the reduction in the market value of the remainder of the property. The property owner is entitled to present any relevant evidence concerning diminution of market value caused by the taking. If the evidence supports a finding that a diminution of market value has occurred, compensation must be awarded. La Plata Elec. Ass’n, Inc. v. Cummins, 728 P.2d 696 (Colo. 1986); Bement v. Empire Elec. Ass’n, Inc. 28 P.2d 706 (Colo. 1986); Herring v. Platte River Power Auth., 728 P.2d 709 (Colo. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Loss and inconvenience thereby occasioned may be considered
        </b>
        in determining the proper measure of damages recoverable by an owner whose property has been taken. City of Denver v. Bayer, 7 Colo. 113, 2 P. 6 (1883); Colo. Cent. R.R. v. Allen, 13 Colo. 229, 22 P. 605 (1889); Colo. M. Ry. v. Brown, 15 Colo. 193, 25 P. 87 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Loss of means of access to premises considered.
        </b>
        Where the premises sought are used by the landowner as the means of access to the premises not taken, the injury occasioned by the taking will, in this respect, be special to him, and he is entitled to compensation therefor. Lavelle v. Town of Julesburg, 49 Colo. 290, 112 P. 774 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it would seem difficult to establish the true or market value of access rights since they are not a commodity dealt in on a buying and selling market, the right of ingress and egress to and from a person’s property adds or detracts from the property value and it would seem that the true value of such rights could only be found in the difference between the value of the land and its use for any and all kinds of purposes before the disturbance or destruction of such rights, and the value of the land minus any access or disturbed or inconvenient access to the highway. Boxberger v. State Hwy. Comm’n, 126 Colo. 526, 251 P.2d 920 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Damage for loss beyond market value prohibited.
        </b>
        The condemnor is not permitted to add an additional element of damage for loss of use beyond the market value. Vivian v. Bd. of Trustees, 152 Colo. 556, 383 P.2d 801 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Costs of restoration are not allowed
        </b>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Evidence of aesthetic damage and damage for loss of view,
        </b>
        which would result from construction of power line, is admissible in assessing damages to remainder since unsightliness or loss of view did not affect any other owner or public in a general way but did specifically affect remainder. La Plata Elec. Ass’n, Inc. v. Cummins, 703 P.2d 592 (Colo. App. 1985), aff’d, 728 P.2d 696 (Colo. 1986).
       </p>

        <b>
         Jury cannot consider general benefits.
        </b>
        General benefits, which accrue to the residue of property after a condemnation by reason of the improvement, may not be considered by the jury in arriving at the market value of the residue after the taking. Mack v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 152 Colo. 300, 381 P.2d 987 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         “Benefit”.
        </b>
        “Benefit”, as used in eminent domain law, is not equivalent or interchangeable with “benefit” that arises out of special improvement. City of Englewood v. Weist, 184 Colo. 325, 520 P.2d 120 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Benefit” that justifies a special assessment tax is not the same “benefit” that must be calculated and deducted from a landowner’s recovery in an eminent domain proceeding. City of Englewood v. Weist, 184 Colo. 325, 520 P.2d 120 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         General benefit cannot be set off against damages.
        </b>
        General benefits that result to the owner in common with the public and other nearby owners cannot be set off against damages. W. Slope Gas Co. v. Lake Eldora Corp., 32 Colo. App. 293, 512 P.2d 641 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Special benefits that may be set off against damages
        </b>
        are those benefits that accrue directly to the residue as a result of the construction of the improvement and that directly and particularly benefit that residue as opposed to benefitting the public generally. W. Slope Gas Co. v. Lake Eldora Corp., 32 Colo. App. 293, 512 P.2d 641 (1973); E-470 Pub. Highway Auth. v. 455 Co., 983 P.2d 149 (Colo. App. 1999), rev’d on other grounds, 3 P.3d 18 (Colo. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Special benefits may generally be set off against a condemnation award
        </b>
        but cannot be set off where the remaining property is subject to an assessment for those same benefits. E-470 Pub. Highway Auth. v. 455 Co., 983 P.2d 149 (Colo. App. 1999), rev’d on other grounds, 3 P.3d 18 (Colo. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Trial court abused its discretion by granting landowners’ motion in limine to exclude all evidence of special benefits accruing to the landowners’ property as a result of the E-470 highway construction.
        </b>
        The commissioners should have had the opportunity at trial to consider all parties’ evidence of the special benefits accruing to the remaining property. Both the highway authority’s and the landowners’ appraisers agreed that construction of the E-470 conferred special benefits on the landowners’ remaining property. By excluding this evidence of special benefits, the trial court effectively ensured that the landowners would recover in an amount greater than they suffered. E-470 Pub. Hwy. Auth. v. 455 Co., 3 P.3d 18 (Colo. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the highway expansion fee is labeled as a “special fee” or a “special assessment”, the mere existence of such fee is not, in and of itself, an adequate basis for excluding all evidence of special benefits for two reasons: (1) The fee is speculative; and (2) the fee does not charge for the same benefit as those the highway authority sought to introduce into evidence. E-470 Pub. Hwy. Auth. v. 455 Co., 3 P.3d 18 (Colo. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         City’s collection of special assessment tax not foreclosed.
        </b>
        A city’s failure to prove any benefit to the landowner’s property in the section 38-1-101 proceeding does not foreclose the city from collecting a special assessment tax. The city is entitled to specially assess for the benefit accruing to the landowner’s property by the construction of the special improvement. City of Englewood v. Weist, 184 Colo. 325, 520 P.2d 120 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Record that included contradictory and conflicting evidence supported the trial court’s determination
        </b>
        that diminution, if any, of the value of condemnee’s remaining property was de minimis even though condemnee testified that he was forced to sell his remaining lots low because the condemnation action could possibly result in a loss of privacy, an increased traffic flow, and an inability to construct a security gate at the entrance to the subdivision. Colo. Mtn. Prop. v. Heineman, 860 P.2d 1388 (Colo. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Trial court’s refusal to award damages based on the purportedly lower sales prices of condemnee’s lots is consistent with
        </b>
        rule that compensation in a condemnation action is measured either at the time the petitioner is authorized to take possession or at the date of the trial or hearing in which compensation is assessed, particularly where the trial court, within its discretion, found that condemnee failed to meet the burden of establishing that claimed loss. Colo. Mtn. Prop. v. Heineman, 860 P.2d 1388 (Colo. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Trial court did not err in awarding nominal damages
        </b>
        since the record supports its finding that there was not evidence presented of any additional cost of the roadway other than evidence of initial costs that were not associated with the subsequent grant of the access easement. Colo. Mtn. Prop. v. Heineman, 860 P.2d 1388 (Colo. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No unjust enrichment where
        </b>
        the record shows that the development costs in building roadway would have been incurred by condemnee regardless of whether condemnor pursued his rights in condemnation. Colo. Mtn. Prop. v. Heineman, 860 P.2d 1388 (Colo. App. 1993).

        Trial court appropriately denied award of pre-judgement interest in inverse condemnation case.

       There was no order authorizing the municipality to take possession of the property prior to trial. Moreover, the evaluation date used by each of the parties, without objection from either, was the date of the hearing, and the jury was specifically instructed to determine the value of the property taken as of that date. Accordingly, because the property was valued as of the date of the trial and not as of some earlier date, no award of pre-judgment interest was authorized. Fowler Irrevocable Trust 1992-1 v.

       </b>
       To refuse to award a respondent any fees at all when the trial court has found that the petitioner was not authorized to acquire some of the property interests being sought would thwart the purpose of the statute. Similarly, it would be equally inappropriate to award a respondent all fees incurred in defending the entire action when at least some of petitioner’s condemnation claims were in fact authorized by law. Thus, an “all or nothing” approach would lead to unreasonable and absurd results. Wilkinson v. Gaffney, 981 P.2d 1121 (Colo. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, record supports trial court’s determination that respondents were entitled to an award of only fees incurred in defending against petitioner’s unauthorized claim for a utility easement by condemnation. Further, the court’s ruling is supported by the record and is consistent with the statutory intent of discouraging the filing of unauthorized condemnation claims. Accordingly, trial court committed no abuse of discretion. Wilkinson v. Gaffney, 981 P.2d 1121 (Colo. App. 1999).

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t38a01p02s38-1-201ol11a">
         The power of eminent domain allows the federal government, the state, counties, cities and counties, municipalities, and various other types of governmental entities to condemn property when necessary for public use and allows individual property owners and corporations to condemn property in certain circumstances when condemnation is necessary to create a private way of necessity or to allow beneficial use of private property.
        </li>
        <li id="t38a01p02s38-1-201ol11b">
         Although both the state constitution and state statutes require the payment of just compensation to any person whose property is condemned, the exercise of the power of eminent domain nonetheless substantially impacts fundamental property rights.
        </li>
        <li id="t38a01p02s38-1-201ol11c">
         Because of this substantial impact, it is necessary and appropriate to ensure that Coloradans can easily determine which governmental entities, corporations, and other persons may exercise the power of eminent domain and to further ensure that Coloradans can easily identify the procedural requirements that entities, corporations, and other persons must follow when exercising the power of eminent domain.

         In addition to counties, cities and counties, and municipalities that serve as general units of government in the state, the governmental structure of the state includes a wide variety of special districts, authorities, and other governmental entities that serve limited governmental purposes, some of which may exercise the power of eminent domain.
        </li>
        <li id="t38a01p02s38-1-201ol12b">
         Although many of the provisions of state law that authorize governmental entities, individuals, and corporations to exercise the power of eminent domain and prescribe procedures that govern the exercise of that power are concentrated in this article and in articles 2 to 7 of this title, the proliferation throughout the history of the state of special districts, authorities, and other governmental entities that serve limited governmental purposes, together with other historical factors that have necessitated grants of eminent domain powers to certain types of corporations and persons, have resulted in the codification in other parts of the Colorado Revised Statutes of many other provisions that authorize the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
        </li>
        <li id="t38a01p02s38-1-201ol12c">
         The codification of provisions of state law that authorize eminent domain in parts of the Colorado Revised Statutes other than this article and articles 2 to 7 of this title makes it difficult in many cases for Coloradans to easily determine, with respect to any given governmental entity, corporation, or person:
         <ol type="I">

        <li id="t38a01p02s38-1-201ol12d">
         In order to help Coloradans to more easily determine whether any given governmental entity, corporation, or person may exercise the power of eminent domain and identify the procedural requirements that the entity, corporation, or person must follow in exercising the power of eminent domain, it is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of the state to list in this part 2 all of the governmental entities, corporations, and persons that may exercise the power of eminent domain pursuant to provisions of state law and to clarify that the procedural requirements specified in this article and articles 2 to 7 of this title apply to all eminent domain proceedings.

       Proceedings to drain.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the owners of any parcels of land desire to construct a drain for the purpose of carrying off surplus water and they cannot agree among themselves or with the parties who own land below, through which it is expedient to carry the drain in order to reach a natural waterway, then proceedings may be had in the same manner as in cases of eminent domain affecting irrigation works of diversion. The rights-of-way for such drains shall be regarded as equal to those for irrigation canals.

       Mineral landowner may construct connecting railway spur.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is lawful for the owner of any coal or other mineral lands, not contiguous to any railroad in this state, desiring to connect such lands with any railroad by means of a connecting railway spur, not to exceed fifteen miles in length, to construct and operate such connecting railway spur across any other lands lying intermediate between such coal or other mineral lands and any railroad with which such connection may be desired. In case the owner of such coal or other mineral lands is unable to agree with the owner of such intermediate lands for the purchase of any necessary rights-of-way across such intermediate lands for the purpose of constructing and operating such connecting railway spur as to the purchase price on such rights-of-way, then the owner of such coal or other mineral lands may exercise the right of eminent domain and condemn any rights-of-way across such intermediate lands necessary to make such connection and to construct and operate such connecting railway spur, and it may acquire title to such rights-of-way in the manner provided by law for the condemnation of lands for rights-of-way by railroad companies. All the laws of this state relating to the manner of exercising the right of eminent domain by railroad companies are hereby made applicable to such proceedings.

       A telegraph, telephone, electric light, power, gas, or pipeline company, an electric transmission authority, or a city or town is entitled to the right-of-way over or under the land, property, privileges, rights-of-way, and easements of other persons and corporations and to the right to erect its poles, wires, pipes, regulator stations, substations, systems, and offices upon making just compensation therefor in the manner provided by law. When a right-of-way is taken under this section for an interstate electric transmission line, the court shall evaluate public purpose in light of the transmission system as a whole, including public use and benefits occurring either within Colorado or at a regional level. The rights granted by this section and section 38-5-105 to such electric light, power, gas, or pipeline companies or to such cities and towns shall not extend to the taking of any portion of the right-of-way of a railroad company, except to the extent of acquiring any necessary easement to cross the same or to serve such railroad company with electric light, power, or gas service. The rights granted by this section and section 38-5-105 to telegraph or telephone companies shall not extend to the taking of any portion of the right-of-way of a railroad company, except to the extent of acquiring any easement which does not materially interfere with the existing use by the railroad company, or except to the extent of acquiring any necessary easement to cross the same or to serve such railroad company with telegraph or telephone service.

       If any right-of-way is taken by such telegraph, telephone, electric light power, gas, or pipeline company, city or town over any portion of the right-of-way of a railroad company the taking party shall pay the entire cost of constructing its facilities along such right-of-way, including any expenses incurred by the railroad for inspection and flagging as reasonably necessary to avoid interference with safe operation of the railroad. The taking party shall also bear the entire cost, including the cost of such inspection and flagging, of removing, relocating, altering, or protecting any facility installed on right-of-way so taken if, at any time, such removal, relocation, alteration, or protection becomes reasonably necessary to avoid interference with the railroad company’s ability to use its original right-of-way to operate its railroad efficiently and safely and to efficiently and safely serve existing, new, or potential railroad customers. The taking party shall indemnify the railroad company from all losses and expenses resulting from the negligence of the taking party, its successors or contractors, in connection with or related to such right-of-way. The taking party shall have no claim against the railroad for any loss resulting from damage to the taking party’s telegraph or telephone facilities resulting from any unforeseen emergencies or acts of God such as derailment, explosions, collisions, or activities reasonably performed in repairing damages caused by such occurrences.

     <p>
      At any time after jurisdiction has been obtained pursuant to section 38-1-103, the petitioner, upon notice to the respondent pursuant to the Colorado rules of civil procedure, may move for an order for immediate possession. Upon such motion and after hearing, the court, by rule in that behalf made, may authorize the petitioner, upon payment into court or to the clerk thereof of the amount determined by the court as probably sufficient to pay the sum that may ultimately be awarded as compensation and damages for the taking, if not in possession to take possession of such right-of-way, and if already in possession to maintain and keep such possession, and in all cases to use and enjoy such right-of-way during the pendency and until the final conclusion of such proceedings, and the court may stay all actions and proceedings against such petitioner on account thereof. Withdrawal from the sum so deposited may be had as provided in section 38-1-105 (6)(b). At such hearing for immediate possession, the court shall hear and dispose of all objections that are raised at that time concerning the motion for immediate possession, the legal sufficiency of the petition, or the regularity of the proceedings in any other respect.

      <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol11">
       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol11a">
         The passage of House Bill 95-1335, enacted at the first regular session of the sixtieth general assembly, established a policy within the state to encourage competition among the various telecommunications providers, to reduce the barriers to entry for those providers, to authorize and encourage competition within the local exchange telecommunications market, and to ensure that all consumers benefit from such competition and expansion.
        </li>
        <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol11b">
         The stated goals of House Bill 95-1335 were that all citizens have access to a wider range of telecommunications services at rates that are reasonably comparable within the state, that basic service be available and affordable to all citizens, and that universal access to advanced telecommunications services would be available to all consumers. Such goals are essential to the economic and social well-being of the citizens of Colorado and can be accomplished only if telecommunications providers are allowed to develop ubiquitous, seamless, statewide telecommunications networks. To require telecommunications companies to seek authority from every political subdivision within the state to conduct business is unreasonable, impractical, and unduly burdensome. In addition, the general assembly further finds and declares that since the public rights-of-way are dedicated to and held on a nonproprietary basis in trust for the use of the public, their use by telecommunications companies is consistent with such policy and appropriate for the public good.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol12">
       The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that nothing in this article shall be construed to alter or diminish the authority of political subdivisions of the state to lawfully exercise their police powers with respect to activities of telecommunications providers within their boundaries, and, subject to such reservation of authority, that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol12a">
         The construction, maintenance, operation, oversight, and regulation of telecommunications providers and their facilities is a matter of statewide concern and interest;
        </li>
        <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol12b">
         Telecommunications providers operating under the authority of the federal communications commission or the Colorado public utilities commission pursuant to article 15 of title 40, C.R.S., require no additional authorization or franchise by any municipality or other political subdivision of the state to conduct business within a given geographic area and that no such political subdivision has jurisdiction to regulate telecommunications providers based upon the content, nature, or type of telecommunications service or signal they provide except to the extent granted by federal or state legislation;
        </li>
        <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol12c">
         Telecommunications providers have a right to occupy and utilize the public rights-of-way for the efficient conduct of their business;
        </li>
        <li id="t38a5.5s38-5.5-101ol12d">
         Access to rights-of-way and oversight of that access must be competitively neutral, and no telecommunications provider should enjoy any competitive advantage or suffer a competitive disadvantage by virtue of a selective or discriminatory exercise of the police power by a local government.

      Any defendant has the right to appear in the proceeding and file an answer, in writing, with the clerk of the court, at any time prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the petition but not thereafter, in which answer said defendant shall set forth such legal objections as he may have to the condemnation or appropriation of any property owned by him or to the prosecution of said proceeding.

No person shall be disqualified to act as a commissioner by reason of the fact that he may own either the fee or other interest in or to property that might be assessed a special benefit on account of the proposed improvement.

      It is the duty of the commissioners to estimate, fix, and determine the fair and actual cash market value of all property proposed to be taken for the improvement, without reference to the projected improvement, and the fair, direct, and actual damage caused on account of said improvement to other property not taken for the improvement. The commissioners shall provide for the payment of the total amount of their awards for land taken and damaged, in all cases where the resolution or ordinance authorizing the improvement so provides, by assessing against the owners of all real estate which, in their opinion, will be specially benefited by the proposed improvement the amounts of said benefit as special assessments, and such commissioners shall assess the balance required to make said total amount as a general assessment against the petitioning city or city and county. Such special benefits shall be assessed against the owners of each lot or parcel of property that is, in the opinion of said commissioners, specially benefited by said improvement, which said special benefits shall be a lien on the property so charged, and shall be collected as provided by the charter or ordinance of said city or city and county, and when so collected shall be paid into the treasury of said city or city and county as a separate fund, to be used for the payment of the awards and damages.

       A city’s failure to prove any benefit to the landowner’s property in the section 38-1-101 proceeding does not foreclose the city from collecting a special assessment tax. The city was entitled to specially assess for the benefit accruing to the landowner’s property by the construction of the special improvement. City of Englewood v.

      Any person who is the owner of, or who has any interest in, any of the property mentioned in said report, whether appropriated or damaged or against which special benefits have been assessed, may appear, at or before the time fixed by the court for the consideration of said report but not after said time, and file his written objection to said report. Default shall be entered against the owners of all property mentioned in said report who have not filed objections thereto within said time, and the report shall be confirmed by the court as to such persons. At the time fixed by the court for the consideration of said report, the court shall proceed to hear any objections that have been filed, except where a jury trial has been demanded, as provided for in section 38-6-113. Any party interested in said proceeding may introduce such evidence as may tend to establish the right of the matter. The burden of proof to change any finding, award, or assessment of said commissioners shall be upon the person objecting thereto. If it appears to the court that the property of the objector has been appraised by the commissioners at more or less than the fair, actual cash market value thereof, or that the fair, direct, and actual damage to property not taken is greater or less than the amount awarded by the commissioners, or that the property of the objector is assessed a special benefit in an amount greater than it will be actually benefited by the proposed improvement, the court shall so find and shall also find what the proper award or assessment shall be, and judgment shall be rendered accordingly. The court, for good cause shown, may modify, alter, change, annul, or confirm the report of the commissioners, or any part thereof, or may order a new appraisement and assessment as to any of the property affected in the proceeding by the same commissioners or by other commissioners appointed by the court.

The jury shall return a special verdict fixing and determining the damages or compensation to be allowed to each defendant, severally, who has demanded a jury trial, which verdict shall include both the fair, actual cash market value of the land actually taken for the improvement and the direct, fair, and actual damage, if any, caused on account of said improvement to property not taken for the improvement. Any party to the proceeding may move for a new trial in the same manner as in actions at law.

       At any time prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the petition provided for in section 38-6-205, any defendant who owns or is interested in any property to be taken, appropriated, or damaged on account of the proposed improvement may file his demand, in writing, for a trial by a jury of either six or twelve freeholders to appraise and assess the damages which said defendant or person may sustain by reason of the appropriation and condemnation of, or damage to, his property. Any person so demanding a jury, at the time of said demand, shall deposit with the clerk the jury fees for one day’s services according to the rate allowed jurors in the district court. The court shall fix an early date for said trial, and on such date the defendants who have made written demands for jury trial within the time provided shall proceed to submit their claims to the jury. Such jury shall be drawn as in civil actions; except that the jurors shall have the qualifications provided in this section.

       The court shall proceed in the same manner and with like powers as in other cases, except as otherwise provided in this part 2. At the request of any party to the proceedings, the court shall order that the jury go upon the premises sought to be taken or damaged, in charge of a sworn bailiff and in the company of any other person that the court may order, and examine the premises in person. At the conclusion of the evidence, the matters in controversy may be argued by counsel to the jury, and at the conclusion of the arguments the court shall instruct the jury in writing. The jury shall return a special verdict fixing and determining the damages or compensation to be allowed to each defendant, severally, who has demanded a jury trial, which verdict shall include the fair, actual cash market value of the land actually taken for the improvement. Any party to the proceeding may move for a new trial in the same manner as in actions at law. The refusal of said court to grant the same may be excepted to and assigned for appeal, but no appeal shall be permitted to stay the improvement sought by the proceeding.

       The court shall set a date, not less than twenty-one days after the filing of such motion, for the hearing thereon, and the court shall require at least fourteen days’ notice to be given to each party to the proceeding whose interests would be affected by the taking requested. The averments in the motion and the necessity for the vesting of title, or some lesser estate, prior to the final determination of just compensation are deemed admitted unless such averments are controverted in a responsive pleading filed at or before the hearing on the motion for vesting.

       At the hearing on the motion for vesting, if such averments have been controverted in responsive pleadings filed at or before the said hearing and if the court has not previously, in the same proceeding, determined the same, the court shall first hear and determine the following matters:

Appellate review shall not stay the other proceedings under this article, unless the appeal was obtained by the petitioner or unless an order staying such further proceedings is entered by the appellate court upon a showing of irreparable injury.

If the foregoing matters are determined in favor of the petitioner, the court shall appoint three disinterested commissioners, who shall be freeholders, to assess the compensation to which the respondents named in the motion for vesting may be entitled by reason of the appropriation of the petitioner.

The commissioners shall forthwith make, subscribe, and file with the clerk of the court in which such proceedings are had a certified report meeting the requirements of section 38-1-115. Upon the motion of the petitioner filed within fourteen days of receipt of the notice provided for in section 38-7-103 (1), the court shall review the said report of the commissioners, and, upon good cause shown by the petitioner, the court may order a new report by the same or different commissioners, and the said order shall void the report objected to.

      UNIFORM FRAUDULENT TRANSFER ACT
      PREFATORY NOTE
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was promulgated by the Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1918. The Act has been adopted in 25 jurisdictions, including the Virgin Islands. It has also been adopted in the sections of the Bankruptcy Act of 1938 and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 that deal with fraudulent transfers and obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uniform Act was a codification of the “better” decisions applying the Statute of 13 Elizabeth. See Analysis of H.R. 12339, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 213 (1936). The English statute was enacted in some form in many states, but, whether or not so enacted, the voidability of fraudulent transfer was part of the law of every American jurisdiction. Since the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors is seldom susceptible of direct proof, courts have relied on badges of fraud. The weight given these badges varied greatly from jurisdiction, and the Conference sought to minimize or eliminate the diversity by providing that proof of certain fact combinations would conclusively establish fraud. In the absence of evidence of the existence of such facts, proof of a fraudulent transfer was to depend on evidence of actual intent. An important reform effected by the Uniform Act was the elimination of any requirement that a creditor have obtained a judgment or execution returned unsatisfied before bringing an action to avoid a transfer as fraudulent. See American Surety Co. v. Conner, 251 N.Y. 1, 166 N.E. 783, 67 A.L.R. 244 (1929) (per C.J. Cardozo).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Conference was persuaded in 1979 to appoint a committee to undertake a study of the Uniform Act with a view to preparing the draft of a revision. The Conference was influenced by the following considerations:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li id="t38a08ol11">
      The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 has made numerous changes in the section of that Act dealing with fraudulent transfers and obligations, thereby substantially reducing the correspondence of the provisions of the federal bankruptcy law on fraudulent transfers with the Uniform Act.
     </li>
     <li id="t38a08ol12">
      The Committee on Corporate Laws of the Section of Corporations, Banking &amp; Business Law of the American Bar Association, engaged in revising the Model Corporation Act, suggested that the Conference review provisions of the Uniform Act with a view to determining whether the Acts are consistent in respect to the treatment of dividend distributions.
     </li>
     <li id="t38a08ol13">
      The Uniform Commercial Code (located in title 4 of C.R.S.), enacted at least in part by all 50 states, had substantially modified related rules of law regulating transfers of personal property, notably by facilitating the making and perfection of security transfers against attack by unsecured creditors.
     </li>
     <li id="t38a08ol14">
      Debtors and trustees in a number of cases have avoided foreclosure of security interests by invoking the fraudulent transfer section of the Bankruptcy Reform Act.
     </li>
     <li id="t38a08ol15">
      The Model Rules of Professional Conduct adopted by the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association on August 2, 1983, forbid a lawyer to counsel or to assist a client in conduct that the lawyer knows is fraudulent.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The Drafting Committee appointed by the Conference held its first meeting in January of 1983. A first reading of a draft of the revision of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was had at the Conference’s meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, on July 27, 1983. The Committee held four meetings in addition to a meeting held in connection with the Conference meeting in Boca Raton. Meetings were also attended by the following representatives of interested organizations:
    </p>
    <p>
     Robert Rosenberg, Esq., of the American Bar Association;
    </p>
    <p>
     Richard Cherin, Esq., of the Commercial Financial Services Committee of the Corporation, Banking and Business Law Section of the American Bar Association;
    </p>
    <p>
     Robert Zinman, Esq., of the American College of Real Estate Lawyers;
    </p>
    <p>
     Bruce Bernstein, Esq., of the National Commercial Finance Association;
    </p>
    <p>
     Ernest E. Specks, Esq., of the Real Property, Probate and Trust Law Section of the American Bar Association.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Committee determined to rename the Act the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act in recognition of its applicability to transfers of personal property as well as real property, “conveyance” having a connotation restricting it to a transfer of personal property. As noted in Comment (2) accompanying § 1(2) (numbered as section 38-8-102 (2) in C.R.S.) and Comment (8) accompanying § 4 (numbered as section 38-8-105 in C.R.S.), however, this Act, like the original Uniform Act, does not purport to cover the whole law of voidable transfers and obligations. The limited scope of the original Act did not impair its effectiveness in achieving uniformity in the areas covered. See McLaughlin, Application of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, 46 Harv. L. Rev. 404, 405 (1933).
    </p>
    <p>
     The basic structure and approach of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act are preserved in the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. There are two sections in the new Act delineating what transfers and obligations are fraudulent. Section 4(a) (numbered as section 38-8-105 (1) in C.R.S.) is an adaptation of three sections of the U.F.C.A.; § 5(a) (numbered as section 38-8-106 (1) in C.R.S.) is an adaptation of another section of the U.F.C.A.; and § 5(b) (numbered as section 38-8-106 (2) in C.R.S.) is new. One section of the U.F.C.A. (§ 8) is not carried forward into the new Act because deemed to be redundant in part and in part susceptible of inequitable application. Both Acts declare a transfer made or an obligation incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors to be fraudulent. Both Acts render a transfer made or obligation incurred without adequate consideration to be constructively fraudulent - i.e., without regard to the actual intent of the parties - under one of the following conditions:
    </p>
    <p>
     (1) the debtor was left by the transfer or obligation with unreasonably small assets for a transaction or the business in which he was engaged;
    </p>
    <p>
     (2) the debtor intended to incur, or believed that he would incur, more debts than he would be able to pay; or
    </p>
    <p>
     (3) the debtor was insolvent at the time or as a result of the transfer or obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
     As under the original Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act a transfer or obligation that is constructively fraudulent because insolvency concurs with or follows failure to receive adequate consideration is voidable only by a creditor in existence at the time the transfer occurs or the obligation is incurred. Either an existing or subsequent creditor may avoid a transfer or obligation for inadequate consideration when accompanied by the financial condition specified in § 4(a)(2)(i) (section 38-8-105 (1)(b)(I) in C.R.S.) or the mental state specified in § 4(a)(2)(ii) (section 38-8-104 (1)(b)(II) in C.R.S.).
    </p>
    <p>
     Reasonably equivalent value is required in order to constitute adequate consideration under the revised Act. The revision follows the Bankruptcy Code in eliminating good faith on the part of the transferee or obligee as an issue in the determination of whether adequate consideration is given by a transferee or obligee. The new Act, like the Bankruptcy Act, allows the transferee or obligee to show good faith in defense after a creditor establishes that a fraudulent transfer has been made or a fraudulent obligation has been incurred. Thus a showing by a defendant that a reasonable equivalent has been given in good faith for a transfer or obligation is a complete defense although the debtor is shown to have intended to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.
    </p>
    <p>
     A good faith transferee or obligee who has given less than a reasonable equivalent is nevertheless allowed a reduction in liability to the extent of the value given. The new Act, like the Bankruptcy Code, eliminates the provision of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act that enables a creditor to attack a security transfer on the ground that the value of the property transferred is disproportionate to the debt secured. The premise of the new Act is that the value of the interest transferred for security is measured by and thus corresponds exactly to the debt secured. Foreclosure of a debtor’s interest by a regularly conducted, noncollusive sale on default under a mortgage or other security agreement may not be avoided under the Act as a transfer for less than a reasonably equivalent value.
    </p>
    <p>
     The definition of insolvency under the Act is adapted from the definition of the term in the Bankruptcy Code. Insolvency is presumed from proof of a failure generally to pay debts as they become due.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new Act adds a new category of fraudulent transfer, namely, a preferential transfer by an insolvent insider to a creditor who had reasonable cause to believe the debtor to be insolvent. An insider is defined in much the same way as in the Bankruptcy Code and includes a relative, also defined as in the Bankruptcy Code, a director or officer of a corporate debtor, a partner, or a person in control of a debtor. This provision is available only to an existing creditor. Its premise is that an insolvent debtor is obliged to pay debts to creditors not related to him before paying those who are insiders.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new Act omits any provision directed particularly at transfers or obligations of insolvent partnership debtors. Under § 8 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act any transfer made or obligation incurred by an insolvent partnership to a partner is fraudulent without regard to intent or adequacy of consideration. So categorical a condemnation of a partnership transaction with a partner may unfairly prejudice the interests of a partner’s separate creditors. The new Act also omits as redundant a provision in the original Act that makes fraudulent a transfer made or obligation incurred by an insolvent partnership for less than a fair consideration to the partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 7 (numbered as section 38-8-108 in C.R.S.) lists the remedies available to creditors under the new Act. It eliminates as unnecessary and confusing a differentiation made in the original Act between the remedies available to holders of matured claims and those holding unmatured claims. Since promulgation of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act the Supreme Court has imposed restrictions on the availability and use of prejudgment remedies. As a result many states have amended their statutes and rules applicable to such remedies, and it is frequently unclear whether a state’s procedures include a prejudgment remedy against a fraudulent transfer or obligation. A bracketed paragraph is included in Section 7 for adoption by those states that elect to make such a remedy available.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 8 (numbered as section 38-8-109 in C.R.S.) prescribes the measure of liability of a transferee or obligee under the Act and enumerates defenses. Defenses against avoidance of a preferential transfer to an insider under § 5(b) (numbered as section 38-8-106 (2) in C.R.S.) include an adaptation of defenses available under § 547(c)(2) and (4) of the Bankruptcy Code when such a transfer is sought to be avoided as a preference by the trustee in bankruptcy. In addition a preferential transfer may be justified when shown to be made pursuant to a good faith effort to stave off forced liquidation and rehabilitate the debtor. Section 8 also precludes avoidance, as a constructively fraudulent transfer, of the termination of a lease on default or the enforcement of a security interest in compliance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new Act includes a new section specifying when a transfer is made or an obligation is incurred. The section specifying the time when a transfer occurs is adapted from Section 548(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. Its premise is that if the law prescribes a mode for making the transfer a matter of public record or notice, it is not deemed to be made for any purpose under the Act until it has become such a matter of record or notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new Act also includes a statute of limitations that bars the right rather than the remedy on expiration of the statutory periods prescribed. The law governing limitations on actions to avoid fraudulent transfers among the states is unclear and full of diversity. The Act recognizes that laches and estoppel may operate to preclude a particular creditor from pursuing a remedy against a fraudulent transfer or obligation even though the statutory period of limitations has not run.

      This section was numbered as section 1 in the uniform act. In the introductory portion to this section, after the word “article”, Colorado added a comma and the words “unless the context otherwise requires”. In the introductory portion to subsection (2), Colorado replaced a comma with a period and changed the words “but the term does not include” to “‘Asset ’ shall not include”. In subsection (2)(b), after “exempt”, Colorado added “immediately prior to the time of transfer”. The definition of “control” in subsection (4) has been added and subsequent definitions renumbered accordingly. In subsection (8), the word “means” has been substituted for “includes”.

       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol11">
        The definition of “affiliate” is derived from § 101(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol12">
        The definition of “asset” is substantially to the same effect as the definition of “assets” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The definition in this Act, unlike that in the earlier Act, does not, however require a determination that the property is liable for the debts of the debtor. Thus, an unliquidated claim for damages resulting from personal injury or a contingent claim of a surety for reimbursement, contribution, or subrogation may be counted as an asset for the purpose of determining whether the holder of the claim is solvent as a debtor under § 2 of this Act (numbered as section 38-8-103 in C.R.S.), although applicable law may not allow such an asset to be levied on and sold by a creditor. Cf. Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Co. v. Goldman (In re Ollag Construction Equipment Corp.), 578 F.2d 904, 907-09 (2d Cir. 1978).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol13">
        The definition of “claim” is derived from § 101(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the purpose of this Act is primarily to protect unsecured creditors against transfers and obligations injurious to their rights, the words “claim” and “debt” as used in the Act generally have reference to an unsecured claim and debt. As the context may indicate, however, usage of the terms is not so restricted. See, e.g. §§ 1(1)(i)(B) (numbered as section 38-8-102 (1)(b)(II) in C.R.S.) and 1(8) (numbered as section 38-8-102 (9) in C.R.S.).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol14">
        The definition of “creditor” in combination with the definition of “claim” has substantially the same effect as the definition of “creditor” under § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. As under that Act, the holder of an unliquidated tort claim or a contingent claim may be a creditor protected by this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol15">
        The definition of “debt” is derived from § 101(11) of the Bankruptcy Code.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol16">
        The definition of “debtor” is new.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol17">
        The definition of “insider” is derived from § 101(28) of the Bankruptcy Code. The definition has been restricted in clauses (i)(C), (ii)(E), and (iii)(D) (clauses (a)(III), (b)(V), and (c)(IV) in C.R.S.), to make clear that a partner is not an insider of an individual, corporation, or partnership if any of these latter three persons is only a limited partner. The definition of “insider” in the Bankruptcy Code does not purport to make a limited partner an insider of the partners or of the partnership with which the limited partner is associated, but it is susceptible of a contrary interpretation and one which would extend unduly the scope of the defined relationship when the limited partner is not a person in control of the partnership. The definition of “insider” in this Act also differs from the definition in the Bankruptcy Code in omitting the reference in 11 U.S.C. § 101(28)(D) to an elected official or relative of such an official as an insider of a municipality. As in the Bankruptcy Code (see 11 U.S.C. § 102(3)), the word “includes” is not limiting, however. Thus, a court may find a person living with an individual for an extended time in the same household or as a permanent companion to have the kind of close relationship intended to be covered by the term “insider.” Likewise, a trust may be found to be an insider of a beneficiary.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol18">
        The definition of “lien” is derived from paragraphs (30), (31), (43), and (45) of § 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, which define “judicial lien,” “lien,” “security interest,” and “statutory lien” respectively.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol19">
        The definition of “person” is adapted from paragraphs (28) and (30) of § 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code, defining “organization” and “person” respectively.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol110">
        The definition of “property” is derived from § 1-201(33) of the Uniform Probate Code (see section 15-10-201 (36) in C.R.S.). Property includes both real and personal property, whether tangible or intangible, and any interest in property, whether legal or equitable.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol111">
        The definition of “relative” is derived from § 101(37) of the Bankruptcy Code but is explicit in its references to the spouse of a debtor in view of uncertainty as to whether the common law determines degrees of relationship by affinity.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol112">
        The definition of “transfer” is derived principally from § 101(48) of the Bankruptcy Code. The definition of “conveyance” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was similarly comprehensive, and the references in this Act to “payment of money, release, lease, and the creation of a lien or incumbrance” are derived from the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. While the definition in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act did not explicitly refer to an involuntary transfer, the decisions under that Act were generally consistent with an interpretation that covered such a transfer. See, e.g., Hearn 45 St. Corp. v. Jano, 283 N.Y. 139, 27 N.E.2d 814, 128 A.L.R. 1285 (1940) (execution and foreclosure sales); Lefkowitz v. Finkelstein Trading Corp., 14 F.Supp. 898, 899 (S.D.N.Y. 1936) (execution sale); Langan v. First Trust &amp; Deposit Co., 277 App.Div. 1090, 101 N.Y.S.2d 36 (4th Dept. 1950), aff’d, 302 N.Y. 932, 100 N.E.2d 189 (1951) (mortgage foreclosure); Catabene v. Wallner, 16 N.J.Super. 597, 602, 85 A.2d 300, 302 (1951) (mortgage foreclosure).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-102-officialcommentol113">
        The definition of “valid lien” is new. A valid lien includes an equitable lien that may not be defeated by a judicial lien creditor. See, e.g., Pearlman v. Reliance Insurance Co., 371 U.S. 132, 136 (1962) (upholding a surety’s equitable lien in respect to a fund owing a bankrupt contractor).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) (paragraph (a), (b), and (c) in C.R.S.) provide clarification by excluding from the term not only generally exempt property but also an interest in a tenancy by the entirety in many states and an interest that is generally beyond reach by unsecured creditors because subject to a valid lien. This Act, like its predecessor and the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, declares rights and provides remedies for unsecured creditors against transfers that impede them in the collection of their claims. The laws protecting valid liens against impairment by levying creditors, exemption statutes, and the rules restricting levyability of interest in entireties property are limitations on the rights and remedies of unsecured creditors, and it is therefore appropriate to exclude property interests that are beyond the reach of unsecured creditors from the definition of “asset” for the purposes of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       A creditor of a joint tenant or tenant in common may ordinarily collect a judgment by process against the tenant’s interest, and in some states a creditor of a tenant by the entirety may likewise collect a judgment by process against the tenant’s interest. See 2 American Law of Property 10, 22, 28-32 (1952); Craig, An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy, 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258-59 (1974). The levyable interest of such a tenant is included as an asset under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “assets” in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act excluded property that is exempt from liability for debts. The definition did not, however, exclude all property that cannot be reached by a creditor through judicial proceedings to collect a debt. Thus, it included the interest of a tenant by the entirety although in nearly half the states such an interest cannot be subjected to liability for a debt unless it is an obligation owed jointly by the debtor with his or her cotenant by the entirety. See 2 American Law of Property 29 (1952); Craig, An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy, 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258 (1974). The definition in this Act requires exclusion of interests in property held by tenants by the entirety that are not subject to collection process by a creditor without a right to proceed against both tenants by the entirety as joint debtors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “generally exempt” property in § 1(2)(ii) (numbered as section 38-8-102 (2)(b) in C.R.S.) recognizes that all exemptions are subject to exceptions. Creditors having special rights against generally exempt property typically include claimants for alimony, taxes, wages, the purchase price of the property, and labor or materials that improve the property. See Uniform Exemptions Act § 10 and the accompanying Comment. The fact that a particular creditor may reach generally exempt property by resorting to judicial process does not warrant its inclusion as an asset in determining whether the debtor is insolvent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this Act is not an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations (see Comment (8) to § 4 infra) (numbered as section 38-8-105 in C.R.S.), it does not preclude the holder of a claim that may be collected by process against property generally exempt as to other creditors from obtaining relief from a transfer of such property that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim. Likewise the holder of an unsecured claim enforceable against tenants by the entirety is not precluded by the Act from pursuing a remedy against a transfer of property held by the entirety that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonbankruptcy law is the law of a state or federal law that is not part of the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code. The definition of an “asset” thus does not include property that would be subject to administration for the benefit of creditors under the Bankruptcy Code unless it is subject under other applicable law, state or federal, to process for the collection of a creditor’s claim against a single debtor.

        The general assembly restricted the definition of “insider” under this act by substituting the word “means” in place of the word “includes”
       </b>
       in the uniform act. Although the general assembly chose to change only one word--switching the word “includes” to “means”--the change in verbs has substantive implications. The terms “means” and “includes” are not necessarily synonymous. The natural distinction would be that where “means” is employed, the term and its definition are to be interchangeable equivalents, and that the verb “includes” imports a general class, some of whose particular instances are those specified in the definition.

        Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) is derived from the definition of “insolvent” in § 101(29)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. The definition in subsection (a) and the correlated definition of partnership insolvency in subsection (c) (numbered as subsection (3) in C.R.S.) contemplate a fair valuation of the debts as well as the assets of the debtor. As under the definition of the same term in § 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act exempt property is excluded from the computation of the value of the assets. See § 1(2) supra. (numbered as section 38-8-102 (2) in C.R.S.) For similar reasons interests in valid spendthrift trusts and interests in tenancies by the entireties that cannot be severed by a creditor of only one tenant are not included. See the Comment to § 1(2) supra. (numbered as section 38-8-102 (2) in C.R.S.) Since a valid lien also precludes an unsecured creditor from collecting the creditor’s claim from the encumbered interest in a debtor’s property, both the encumbered interest and the debt secured thereby are excluded from the computation of insolvency under this Act. See § 1(2) supra (numbered as section 38-8-102 (2) in C.R.S.) and subsection (e) of this section (numbered as subsection (5) in C.R.S.).

        Section 2(b) (numbered as section 38-8-103 (2) in C.R.S.) establishes a rebuttable presumption of insolvency from the fact of general nonpayment of debts as they become due. Such general nonpayment is a ground for the filing of an involuntary petition under § 303(h)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. See also U.C.C. § 1-201(23), which declares a person to be “insolvent” who “has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business.” The presumption imposes on the party against whom the presumption is directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of insolvency as defined in § 2(a) is more probable than its existence. See Uniform Rules of Evidence (1974 Act), Rule 301(a). The 1974 Uniform Rule 301(a) conforms to the Final Draft of Federal Rule 301 as submitted to the United States Supreme Court by the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Evidence. “The so-called ‘bursting bubble’ theory, under which a presumption vanishes upon the introduction of evidence which would support a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact, even though not believed, is rejected as according presumptions too ‘slight and evanescent’ an effect.” Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 301.

        Subsection (d) (numbered as subsection (4) in C.R.S.) follows the approach of the definition of “insolvency” in § 101(29) of the Bankruptcy Code by excluding from the computation of the value of the debtor’s assets any value that can be realized only by avoiding a transfer of an interest formerly held by the debtor or by discovery or pursuit of property that has been fraudulently concealed or removed.

        Subsection (e) (numbered as subsection (5) in C.R.S.) is new. It makes clear the purpose not to render a person insolvent under this section by counting as a debt an obligation secured by property of the debtor that is not counted as an asset. See also Comments to §§ 1(2) (numbered as section 38-8-102 (2) in C.R.S.) and 2(a) supra (numbered as section 38-8-103 (1) in C.R.S.).

      <p>
       The requirement of § 550(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code that a transferee be “without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer” in order to be protected has been omitted as inappropriate. Knowledge of the facts rendering the transfer voidable would be inconsistent with the good faith that is required of a protected transferee. Knowledge of the voidability of a transfer would seem to involve a legal conclusion. Determination of the voidability of the transfer ought not to require the court to inquire into the legal sophistication of the transferee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption is established in recognition of the difficulties typically imposed on a creditor in proving insolvency in the bankruptcy sense, as provided in subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.). See generally Levit, The Archaic Concept of Balance-Sheet Insolvency, 47 Am.Bankr.L.J. 215 (1973). Not only is the relevant information in the possession of a noncooperative debtor but the debtor’s records are more often than not incomplete and inaccurate. As a practical matter, insolvency is most cogently evidenced by a general cessation of payment of debts, as has long been recognized by the laws of other countries and is now reflected in the Bankruptcy Code. See Honsberger, Failure to Pay One’s Debts Generally as They Become Due: The Experience of France and Canada, 54 Am.Bankr.L.J. 153 (1980); J. MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 13, 63-64, 436 (1956). In determining whether a debtor is paying its debts generally as they become due, the court should look at more than the amount and due dates of the indebtedness. The court should also take into account such factors as the number of the debtor’s debts, the proportion of those debts not being paid, the duration of the nonpayment, and the existence of bona fide disputes or other special circumstances alleged to constitute an explanation for the stoppage of payments. The court’s determination may be affected by a consideration of the debtor’s payment practices prior to the period of alleged nonpayment and the payment practices of the trade or industry in which the debtor is engaged. The case law that has developed under § 303(h)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code has not required a showing that a debtor has failed or refused to pay a majority in number and amount of his or her debts in order to prove general nonpayment of debts as they become due. See, e.g., Hill v. Cargill, Inc. (In re Hill), 8 B.R. 779, 3 C.B.C.2d 920 (Bk.D.Minn. 1981) (nonpayment of three largest debts held to constitute general nonpayment, although small debts were being paid); In re All Media Properties, Inc., 5 B.R. 126, 6 B.C.D. 586, 2 C.B.C.2d 449 (Bk.S.D.Tex. 1980) (missing significant number of payments or regularly missing payments significant in amount said to constitute general nonpayment; missing payments on more than 50% of aggregate of claims said not to be required to show general nonpayment; nonpayment for more than 30 days after billing held to establish nonpayment of a debt when it is due); In re Kreidler Import Corp., 4 B.R. 256, 6 B.C.D. 608, 2 C.B.C.2d 159 (Bk.D.Md. 1980) (nonpayment of one debt constituting 97% of debtor’s total indebtedness held to constitute general nonpayment). A presumption of insolvency does not arise from nonpayment of a debt as to which there is a genuine bona fide dispute, even though the debt is a substantial part of the debtor’s indebtedness. Cf. 11 U.S.C. § 303(h)(1), as amended by § 426(b) of Public Law No. 98-882, the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984.

        The fair value balance sheet method for determining insolvency is essentially mandated for individuals.
       </b>
       The Colorado Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act method of determining insolvency mirrors the balance sheet test for insolvency under the federal bankruptcy code. The balance sheet test for insolvency requires that the court determine the fair value of the debtor’s assets and the extent of its liabilities at the time of each contested transfer. In re Blair, 588 B.R. 605 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (2)’s presumption appears to be based only on a simple factual inquiry:
       </b>
       At the time of the alleged fraudulent transfers, was the debtor paying its debts as they became due, or not? It is a factual question and not really the province for an expert analysis. No expert knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education seems needed to ascertain whether someone is paying their debts. In re Blair, 588 B.R. 605 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2018).

       <li id="t38a08s38-8-104-officialcommentol11">
        This section defines “value” as used in various contexts in this Act, frequently with a qualifying adjective. The word appears in the following sections:
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-104-officialcommentol12">
        Section 3(a) (numbered as section 38-8-104 (1) in C.R.S.) is adapted from § 548(d)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. See also § 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The definition in Section 3 is not exclusive. “Value” is to be determined in light of the purpose of the Act to protect a debtor’s estate from being depleted to the prejudice of the debtor’s unsecured creditors. Consideration having no utility from a creditor’s viewpoint does not satisfy the statutory definition. The definition does not specify all the kinds of consideration that do not constitute value for the purposes of this Act--e.g., love and affection. See, e.g., United States v. West, 299 F.Supp. 661, 666 (D.Del. 1969).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-104-officialcommentol13">
        Section 3(a) does not indicate what is “reasonably equivalent value” for a transfer or obligation. Under this Act, as under § 548(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, a transfer for security is ordinarily for a reasonably equivalent value notwithstanding a discrepancy between the value of the asset transferred and the debt secured, since the amount of the debt is the measure of the value of the interest in the asset that is transferred. See, e.g., Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Co. v. Holy Family Polish Nat’l Catholic Church, Carnegie, Pa., 341 Pa. 390, 19 A.2d 360 (1941). If, however, a transfer purports to secure more than the debt actually incurred or to be incurred, it may be found to be for less than a reasonably equivalent value. See e.g., In re Peoria Braumeister Co., 138 F.2d 520, 523 (7th Cir. 1943) (chattel mortgage securing a $3,000 note held to be fraudulent when the debt secured was only $2,500); Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Jirasek, 254 Mich. 131, 140, 235 N.W. 836, 839 (1931) (quitclaim deed given as mortgage held to be fraudulent to the extent the value of the property transferred exceeded the indebtedness secured). If the debt is a fraudulent obligation under this Act, a transfer to secure it as well as the obligation would be vulnerable to attack as fraudulent. A transfer to satisfy or secure an antecedent debt owed an insider is also subject to avoidance under the conditions specified in Section 5(b) (numbered as section 38-8-106 (2) in C.R.S.).

       <li id="t38a08s38-8-104-officialcommentol14">
        Section 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act has been thought not to recognize that an unperformed promise could constitute fair consideration. See McLaughlin, Application of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, 46 Harv.L.Rev. 404, 414 (1933). Courts construing these provisions of the prior law nevertheless have held unperformed promises to constitute value in a variety of circumstances. See, e.g., Harper v. Lloyd’s Factors, Inc., 214 F.2d 662 (2d Cir. 1954) (transfer of money for promise of factor to discount transferor’s purchase-money notes given to fur dealer); Schlecht v. Schlecht, 168 Minn. 168, 176-77, 209 N.W. 883, 886-87 (1926) (transfer for promise to make repairs and improvements on transferor’s homestead); Farmer’s Exchange Bank v. Oneida Motor Truck Co., 202 Wis. 266, 232 N.W. 536 (1930) transfer in consideration of assumption of certain of transferor’s liabilities; see also Hummel v. Cernocky, 161 F.2d 685 (7th Cir. 1947) (transfer in consideration of cash, assumption of a mortgage, payment of certain debts, and agreement to pay other debts). Likewise a transfer in consideration of a negotiable note discountable at a commercial bank, or the purchase from an established, solvent institution of an insurance policy, annuity, or contract to provide care and accommodations clearly appears to be for value. On the other hand, a transfer for an unperformed promise by an individual to support a parent or other transferor has generally been held voidable as a fraud on creditors of the transferor. See, e.g., Springfield Ins. Co. v. Fry, 267 F.Supp. 693 (N.D.Okla. 1967); Sandler v. Parlapiano, 236 App.Div. 70, 258 N.Y.Supp. 88 (1st Dep’t 1932); Warwick Municipal Employees Credit Union v. Higham, 106 R.E. 363, 259 A.2d 852 (1969); Hulsether v. Sanders, 54 S.D. 412, 223 N.W. 335 (1929); Cooper v. Cooper, 22 Tenn.App. 473, 477, 124 S.W.2d 264, 267 (1939); Note, Rights of Creditors in Property Conveyed in Consideration of Future Support, 45 Iowa L.Rev. 546, 550-62 (1960). This Act adopts the view taken in the cases cited in determining whether an unperformed promise is value.

        Subsection (b) (numbered as subsection (2) in C.R.S.) rejects the rule of such cases as Durrett v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 621 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1980) (nonjudicial foreclosure of a mortgage avoided as a fraudulent transfer when the property of an insolvent mortgagor was sold for less than 70% of its fair value); and Abramson v. Lakewood Bank &amp; Trust Co., 647 F.2d 547 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1164 (1982) (nonjudicial foreclosure held to be fraudulent transfer if made without fair consideration). Subsection (b) adopts the view taken in Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Madrid (In re Madrid), 21 B.R. 424 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1982), aff’d on another ground, 725 F.2d 1197 (9th Cir. 1984), that the price bid at a public foreclosure sale determines the fair value of the property sold. Subsection (b) prescribes the effect of a sale meeting its requirements, whether the asset sold is personal or real property. The rule of this subsection applies to a foreclosure by sale of the interest of a vendee under an installment land contract in accordance with applicable law that requires or permits the foreclosure to be effected by a sale in the same manner as the foreclosure of a mortgage. See G.Osborne, G.Nelson, &amp; D.Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law 83-84, 95-97 (1979). The premise of the subsection is that “a sale of the collateral by the secured party as the normal consequence of default . . . [is] the safest way of establishing the fair value of the collateral . . ..” 2 G.Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property, 1227 (1965).

        Section 4(a)(1) (numbered as section 38-8-105 (1)(a) in C.R.S.) is derived from § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Factors appropriate for consideration in determining actual intent under paragraph (1) (paragraph (a) in C.R.S.) are specified in subsection (b) (subsection (2) in C.R.S.).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-105-officialcommentol12">
        Section 4(a)(2) (numbered as section 38-8-105 (1)(b) in C.R.S.) is derived from §§ 5 and 6 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act but substitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for “fair consideration.” The transferee’s good faith was an element of “fair consideration” as defined in § 3 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, and lack of fair consideration was one of the elements of a fraudulent transfer as defined in four sections of the Uniform Act. The transferee’s good faith is irrelevant to a determination of the adequacy of the consideration under this Act, but lack of good faith may be a basis for withholding protection of a transferee or obligee under § 8 infra (numbered as section 38-8-109 in C.R.S.).

       <li id="t38a08s38-8-105-officialcommentol13">
        Unlike the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act as originally promulgated, this Act does not prescribe different tests when a transfer is made for the purpose of security and when it is intended to be absolute. The premise of this Act is that when a transfer is for security only, the equity or value of the asset that exceeds the amount of the debt secured remains available to unsecured creditors and thus cannot be regarded as the subject of a fraudulent transfer merely because of the encumbrance resulting from an otherwise valid security transfer. Disproportion between the value of the asset securing the debt and the size of the debt secured does not, in the absence of circumstances indicating a purpose to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, constitute an impermissible hindrance to the enforcement of other creditors’ rights against the debtor-transferor. Cf. U.C.C. § 9-311.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-105-officialcommentol14">
        Subparagraph (i) of § 4(a)(2) (subparagraph (I) of section 38-8-105 (1)(b) in C.R.S.) is an adaptation of § 5 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act but substitutes “unreasonably small [assets] in relation to the business or transaction” for “unreasonably small capital.” The reference to “capital” in the Uniform Act is ambiguous in that it may refer to net worth or to the par value of stock or to the consideration received for stock issued. The special meanings of “capital” in corporation law have no relevance in the law of fraudulent transfers. The subparagraph focuses attention on whether the amount of all the assets retained by the debtor was inadequate, i.e., unreasonably small, in light of the needs of the business or transaction in which the debtor was engaged or about to engage.

       <li id="t38a08s38-8-105-officialcommentol15">
        Subsection (b) (subsection (2) in C.R.S.) is a nonexclusive catalogue of factors appropriate for consideration by the court in determining whether the debtor had an actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud one or more creditors. Proof of the existence of any one or more of the factors enumerated in subsection (b) may be relevant evidence as to the debtor’s actual intent but does not create a presumption that the debtor has made a fraudulent transfer or incurred a fraudulent obligation. The list of factors includes most of the badges of fraud that have been recognized by the courts in construing and applying the Statute of 13 Elizabeth and § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Proof of the presence of certain badges in combination establishes fraud conclusively--i.e., without regard to the actual intent of the parties--when they concur as provided in § 4(a)(2) or in § 5 (section 38-8-105 (1)(b) or in section 38-8-106 in C.R.S.). The fact that a transfer has been made to a relative or to an affiliated corporation has not been regarded as a badge of fraud sufficient to warrant avoidance when unaccompanied by any other evidence of fraud. The courts have uniformly recognized, however, that a transfer to a closely related person warrants close scrutiny of the other circumstances, including the nature and extent of the consideration exchanged. See 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences § 307 (Rev. ed. 1940). The second, third, fourth, and fifth factors listed are all adapted from the classic catalogue of badges of fraud provided by Lord Coke in Twyne’s Case, 3 Coke 80b, 76 Eng.Rep. 809 (Star Chamber 1601). Lord Coke also included the use of a trust and the recitation in the instrument of transfer that it “was made honestly, truly, and bona fide,” but the use of the trust is fraudulent only when accompanied by elements or badges specified in this Act, and recitals of “good faith” can no longer be regarded as significant evidence of a fraudulent intent.

        In considering the factors listed in § 4(b) (section 38-8-105 (2) in C.R.S.) a court should evaluate all the relevant circumstances involving a challenged transfer or obligation. Thus the court may appropriately take into account all indicia negativing as well as those suggesting fraud, as illustrated in the following reported cases:

        The effect of the two transfers described in § 4(b)(11) (section 38-8-105 (2)(k) in C.R.S.), if not avoided, may be to permit a debtor and a lienor to deprive the debtor’s unsecured creditors of access to the debtor’s assets for the purpose of collecting their claims while the debtor, the debtor’s affiliate or insider, and the lienor arrange for the beneficial use or disposition of the assets in accordance with their interests. The kind of disposition sought to be reached here is exemplified by that found in Northern Pacific Co. v. Boyd, 228 U.S. 482 (1913), the leading case in establishing the absolute priority doctrine in reorganization law. There the Court held that a reorganization whereby the secured creditors and the management-owners retained their economic interests in a railroad through a foreclosure that cut off claims of unsecured creditors against its assets was in effect a fraudulent disposition (id. at 502-05). See Frank, Some Realistic Reflections on Some Aspects of Corporate Reorganization, 19 Va. L.Rev. 541, 693 (1933). For cases in which an analogous injury to unsecured creditors was inflicted by a lienor and a debtor, see Jackson v. Star Sprinkler Corp. of Florida, 575 F.2d 1223, 1231-34 (8th Cir. 1978); Heath v. Helmick, 173 F.2d 157, 161-62 (9th Cir. 1949); Toner v. Nuss, 234 F.S. 457, 461-62 (E.D.Pa. 1964); and see In re Spotless Tavern Co., Inc., 4 F.Supp. 752, 753, 755 (D.Md. 1933).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-105-officialcommentol18">
        Nothing in § 4(b) (section 38-8-105 (2) in C.R.S.) is intended to affect the application of § 2-402(2), 9-205, 9-301, or 6-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 2-402(2) recognizes the generally prevailing rule that retention of possession of goods by a seller may be fraudulent but limits the application of the rule by negating any imputation of fraud from “retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification.” Section 9-205 explicitly negates any imputation of fraud from the grant of liberty by a secured creditor to a debtor to use, commingle, or dispose of personal property collateral or to account for its proceeds. The section recognizes that it does not relax prevailing requirements for delivery of possession by a pledgor. Moreover, the section does not mitigate the general requirement of § 9-301(1)(b) that a nonpossessory security interest in personal property must be accompanied by notice-filing to be effective against a levying creditor. Finally, like the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act this Act does not pre-empt the statutes governing bulk transfers, such as Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Compliance with the cited sections of the Uniform Commercial Code does not, however, insulate a transfer or obligation from avoidance. Thus a sale by an insolvent debtor for less than a reasonably equivalent value would be voidable under this Act notwithstanding compliance with the Uniform Commercial Code.

       <b>
        The Colorado Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (CUFTA) changes the common law rule that a claim of conspiracy
       </b>
       to fraudulently convey property fails unless the claimant establishes a lien against the property transferred. Double Oak Constr., L.L.C. v. Cornerstone Dev. Int’l, L.L.C., 97 P.3d 140 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principle behind the “lien requirement” rule is that, until a creditor obtains a lien giving him or her vested or specific rights in the debtor’s property, the debtor is legally free to do what he or she will with his or her property. However, modern fraudulent transfer law, like CUFTA, has dispensed with the lien requirement, focusing instead on the debtor’s intent to frustrate the creditor once its claim is made known. Double Oak Constr., L.L.C. v. Cornerstone Dev. Int’l, L.L.C., 97 P.3d 140 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A transfer in violation of CUFTA is a legal wrong that will support a conspiracy claim.
       </b>
       A creditor who does not have a lien on the subject property is nevertheless entitled to assert a civil conspiracy cause of action against persons who participate in a fraudulent conveyance. Double Oak Constr., L.L.C. v. Cornerstone Dev. Int’l, L.L.C., 97 P.3d 140 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        For purposes of CUFTA, the intent of a transferee can be imputed to the debtor when the transferee is in a position to dominate or control the disposition of the debtor’s property.

       <b>
        Nothing in this section indicates that the plaintiff’s burden of proving fraudulent intent may be reduced
       </b>
       by attaching a presumption of fraud to a transaction between a principal and an agent. Schempp v. Lucre Mgmt. Group, 75 P.3d 1157 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>

       <b>
        Whether a debtor intended to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors is a question of fact.

       The movant has the burden of proving all elements of a fraudulent transfer before the debtor must come forward to prove his or her defenses. Krol v. Unglaub, 332 B.R. 303 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Evidence that transactions were in the ordinary course of business may negate the actual intent element of fraudulent transfer.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In determining whether a transfer is made with actual intent to defraud, CUFTA sets forth several factors, known as the “badges of fraud”, from which an inference of fraudulent intent may be drawn.
       </b>
       Krol v. Unglaub, 332 B.R. 303 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       When these “badges of fraud” are present in sufficient number, they may give rise to an inference or presumption of an intent to defraud. Krol v. Unglaub, 332 B.R. 303 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Separate findings are not required on each of the “badges of fraud” in subsection (2)
       </b>
       where the findings and the record make it clear that the court was aware of and considered many, if not all, of such factors. Silverberg v. Colantuno, 991 P.2d 280 (Colo. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Reasonably equivalent value” is not the same as market value,
       </b>
       although market value is an important factor to be used in the assessment. Silverberg v. Colantuno, 991 P.2d 280 (Colo. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Whether “reasonably equivalent value” has been received is a question of fact.
       </b>
       What constitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for the transfer requires an analysis of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction. The standard of reasonably equivalent value implies a rule of reasonableness in light of the particular circumstances. Reasonable equivalence is not synonymous with market value, even though market value is an important factor to be utilized in the assessment. For purposes of the Colorado Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, equity looks to the substance of the transaction rather than its form. Krol v. Unglaub, 332 B.R. 303 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A transfer for which the transferor received no direct or indirect benefit cannot be considered reasonably equivalent value,
       </b>
       even with the undisputed history of the transfers of the property back and forth between a husband and wife for zero dollars. Leverage Leasing Co. v. Smith, 143 P.3d 1164 (Colo. App. 2006).

        Subsection (a) (numbered as subsection (1) in C.R.S.) is derived from § 4 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. It adheres to the limitation of the protection of that section to a creditor who extended credit before the transfer or obligation described. As pointed out in Comment (2) accompanying § 4 (section 38-8-105 in C.R.S.), this Act substitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for “fair consideration.”

        Subsection (b) (subsection (2) in C.R.S.) renders a preferential transfer--i.e., a transfer by an insolvent debtor for or on account of an antecedent debt--to an insider vulnerable as a fraudulent transfer when the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent. This subsection adopts for general application the rule of such cases as Jackson Sound Studios, Inc. v. Travis, 473 F.2d 503 (5th Cir. 1973) (security transfer of corporation’s equipment to corporate principal’s mother perfected on eve of bankruptcy of corporation held to be fraudulent); In re Lamie Chemical Co., 296 F. 24 (4th Cir. 1924) (corporate preference to corporate officers and directors held voidable by receiver when corporation was insolvent or nearly so and directors had already voted for liquidation); Stuart v. Larson, 298 F. 223 (8th Cir. 1924), noted 38 Harv.L.Rev. 521 (1925) (corporate preference to director held voidable). See generally 2 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences 386 (rev. ed. 1940). Subsection (b) overrules such cases as Epstein v. Goldstein, 107 F.2d 755, 757 (2d Cir. 1939) (transfer by insolvent husband to wife to secure his debt to her sustained against attack by husband’s trustee); Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Jirasek, 254 Mich. 131, 139, 235 N.W. 836, 389 (1931) (mortgage given by debtor to his brother to secure an antecedent debt owed the brother sustained as not fraudulent).

        Subsection (b) (subsection (2) in C.R.S.) does not extend as far as § 8(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and § 548(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in rendering voidable a transfer or obligation incurred by an insolvent partnership to a partner, who is an insider of the partnership. The transfer to the partner is not vulnerable to avoidance under § 4(b) (section 38-8-105 (2) in C.R.S.) unless the transfer was for an antecedent debt and the partner had reasonable cause to believe that the partnership was insolvent. The cited provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and the Bankruptcy Act make any transfer by an insolvent partnership to a partner voidable. Avoidance of the partnership transfer without reference to the partner’s state of mind and the nature of the consideration exchanged would be unduly harsh treatment of the creditors of the partner and unduly favorable to the creditors of the partnership.

        One of the uncertainties in the law governing the avoidance of fraudulent transfers and obligations is the difficulty of determining when the cause of action arises. Subsection (b) (subsection (2) in C.R.S.) clarifies this point in time. For transfers of real estate Section 6(1) (section 38-8-107 (1) in C.R.S.) fixes the time as the date of perfection against a good faith purchaser from the transferor and for transfers of fixtures and assets constituting personalty, the time is fixed as the date of perfection against a judicial lien creditor not asserting rights under this Act. Perfection typically is effected by notice-filing, recordation, or delivery of unequivocal possession. See U.C.C. §§ 9-302, 9-304, and 9-305 (security interest in personal property perfected by notice-filing or delivery of possession to transferee); 4 American Law of Property § 17.10-17.12 (1952) (recordation of transfer or delivery of possession to grantee required for perfection against bona fide purchaser from grantor). The provision for postponing the time a transfer is made until its perfection is an adaptation of § 548(d)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. When no steps are taken to perfect a transfer that applicable law permits to be perfected, the transfer is deemed by paragraph (2) to be perfected immediately before the filing of an action to avoid it; without such a provision to cover that eventuality, an unperfected transfer would arguably be immune to attack. Some transfers--e.g., an assignment of a bank account, creation of a security interest in money, or execution of a marital or premarital agreement for the disposition of property owned by the parties to the agreement--may not be amenable to perfection as against a bona fide purchaser or judicial lien creditor. When a transfer is not perfectible as provided in paragraph (11), the transfer occurs for the purpose of this Act when the transferor effectively parts with an interest in the asset as provided in § 1(12) supra (section 38-8-102 (12) in C.R.S.).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-107-officialcommentol12">
        Paragraph (4) requires the transferor to have rights in the asset transferred before the transfer is made for the purpose of this section. This provision makes clear that its purpose may not be circumvented by notice-filing or recordation of a document evidencing an interest in an asset to be acquired in the future. Cf. Bankruptcy Code § 547(e); U.C.C. § 9-203(1)(c).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-107-officialcommentol13">
        Paragraph (5) is new. It is intended to resolve uncertainty arising from Rubin v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 661 F.2d 979, 989-91, 997 (2d Cir. 1981), insofar as that case holds that an obligation of guaranty may be deemed to be incurred when advances covered by the guaranty are made rather than when the guaranty first became effective between the parties. Compare Rosenberg, Intercorporate Guaranties and the Law of Fraudulent Conveyances: Lender Beware, 125 U.Pa.L.Rev. 235, 256-57 (1976).

       An obligation may be avoided as fraudulent under this Act if it is incurred under the circumstances specified in § 4(a) (section 38-8-105 (1) in C.R.S.) or § 5(a) (section 38-8-106 (1) in C.R.S.). The debtor may receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for an obligation incurred even though the benefit to the debtor is indirect. See Rubin v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 661 F.2d at 991-92; Williams v. Twin City Co., 251 F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir. 1958); Rosenberg, supra at 243-46.

        This section is derived from §§ 9 and 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Section 9 of that Act specified the remedies of creditors whose claims have matured, and § 10 enumerated the remedies available to creditors whose claims have not matured. A creditor holding an unmatured claim may be denied the right to receive payment for the proceeds of a sale on execution until his claim has matured, but the proceeds may be deposited in court or in an interest-bearing account pending the maturity of the creditor’s claim. The remedies specified in this section are not exclusive.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-108-officialcommentol12">
        The availability of an attachment or other provisional remedy has been restricted by amendments of statutes and rules of procedure to reflect views of the Supreme Court expressed in Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337 (1969), and its progeny. This judicial development and the procedural changes that followed in its wake do not preclude resort to attachment by a creditor in seeking avoidance of a fraudulent transfer or obligation. See, e.g., Britton v. Howard Sav. Bank, 727 F.2d 315, 317-20 (3d Cir. 1984); Computer Sciences Corp. v. Sci-Tek Inc., 367 A.2d 658, 661 (Del. Super. 1976); Great Lakes Carbon Corp. v. Fontana, 54 A.D.2d 548, 387 N.Y.S. 2d 115 (1st Dep’t 1976). Section 7(a)(2) (section 38-8-108 (1)(b) in C.R.S.) continues the authorization for the use of attachment contained in § 9(b) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, or of a similar provisional remedy, when the state’s procedure provides therefor, subject to the constraints imposed by the due process clauses of the United States and state constitutions.

        Subsections (a) and (b) of § 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act authorized the court, in an action on a fraudulent transfer or obligation, to restrain the defendant from disposing of his property, to appoint a receiver to take charge of his property, or to make any order the circumstances may require. Section 10, however, applied only to a creditor whose claim was unmatured. There is no reason to restrict the availability of these remedies to such a creditor, and the courts have not so restricted them. See, e.g., Lipskey v. Voloshen, 155 Md. 139, 143-45, 141 Atl. 402, 404-05 (1928) (judgment creditor granted injunction against disposition of property by transferee, but appointment of receiver denied for lack of sufficient showing of need for such relief); Matthews v. Schusheim, 36 Misc. 2d 918, 922-23, 235 N.Y.S.2d 973, 976-77, 991-92 (Sup.Ct. 1962) (injunction and appointment of receiver granted to holder of claims for fraud, breach of contract, and alimony arrearages; whether creditor’s claim was mature said to be immaterial); Oliphant v. Moore, 155 Tenn. 359, 362-63, 293 S.W. 541, 542 (1927) (tort creditor granted injunction restraining alleged tortfeasor’s disposition of property).

        As under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, a creditor is not required to obtain a judgment against the debtor-transferor or to have a matured claim in order to proceed under subsection (a) (subsection (1) in C.R.S.).

        The provision in subsection (b) (subsection (2) in C.R.S.) for a creditor to levy execution on a fraudulently transferred asset continues the availability of a remedy provided in § 9(b) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. See, e.g., Doland v. Burns Lbr. Co., 156 Minn. 238, 194 N.W. 636 (1923); Montana Ass’n of Credit Management v. Hergert, 181 Mont. 442, 449, 453, 593 P.2d 1059, 1063, 1065 (1979); Corbett v.

        Subsection (a) (subsection (1) in C.R.S.) states the rule that applies when the transferee establishes a complete defense to the action for avoidance based on Section 4(a)(1) (section 38-8-105 (1)(a) in C.R.S.). The subsection is an adaptation of the exception stated in § 9 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The person who invokes this defense carries the burden of establishing good faith and the reasonable equivalence of the consideration exchanged. Chorost v. Grand Rapids Factory Showrooms, Inc., 77 F. Supp. 276, 280 (D.N.J. 1948), aff’d, 172 F.2d 327, 329 (3d Cir. 1949).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-109-officialcommentol12">
        Subsection (b) (subsection (2) in C.R.S.) is derived from § 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The value of the asset transferred is limited to the value of the levyable interest on the transferor, exclusive of any interest encumbered by a valid lien. See § 1(2) supra (section 38-8-102 (2) in C.R.S.).
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-109-officialcommentol13">
        Subsection (c) (subsection (3) in C.R.S.) is new. The measure of the recovery of a defrauded creditor against a fraudulent transferee is usually limited to the value of the asset transferred at the time of the transfer. See, e.g., United States v. Fernon, 640 F.2d 609, 611 (5th Cir. 1981); Hamilton Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Halstead, 134 N.Y. 520, 31 N.E. 900 (1892); cf. Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co., 289 U.S. 227 (1932) (transferee’s objection to trial court’s award of highest value of asset between the date of the transfer and the date of the decree of avoidance rejected because an award measured by value as of time of the transfer plus interest from that date would have been larger). The premise of § 8(c) is that changes in value of the asset transferred that occur after the transfer should ordinarily not affect the amount of the creditor’s recovery. Circumstances may require a departure from that measure of the recovery, however, as the cases decided under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and other laws derived from the Statute of 13 Elizabeth illustrate. Thus, if the value of the asset at the time of levy and sale to enforce the judgment of the creditor has been enhanced by improvements of the asset transferred or discharge of liens on the property, a good faith transferee should be reimbursed for the outlay for such a purpose to the extent the sale proceeds were increased thereby. See Bankruptcy Code § 550(d); Janson v. Schier, 375 A.2d 1159, 1160 (N.H. 1977); Anno., 8 A.L.R. 527 (1920). If the value of the asset has been diminished by severance and disposition of timber or minerals or fixtures, the transferee should be liable for the amount of the resulting reduction. See Damazo v. Wahby, 269 Md. 252, 257, 305 A.2d 138, 142 (1973). If the transferee has collected rents, harvested crops, or derived other income from the use or occupancy of the asset after the transfer, the liability of the transferee should be limited in any event to the net income after deduction of the expense incurred in earning the income. Anno., 60 A.L.R.2d 593 (1958). On the other hand, adjustment for the equities does not warrant an award to the creditor of consequential damages alleged to accrue from mismanagement of the asset after the transfer.

       <li id="t38a08s38-8-109-officialcommentol14">
        Subsection (d) (subsection (4) in C.R.S.) is an adaptation of § 548(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. An insider who receives property or an obligation from an insolvent debtor as security for or in satisfaction of an antecedent debt of the transferor or obligor is not a good faith transferee or obligee if the insider has reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred.
       </li>
       <li id="t38a08s38-8-109-officialcommentol15">
        Subsection (e)(1) (subsection (5)(a) in C.R.S.) rejects the rule adopted in Darby v. Atkinson (In re Farris), 415 F.Supp. 33, 39-41 (W.D.Okla. 1976), that termination of a lease on default in accordance with its terms and applicable law may constitute a fraudulent transfer. Subsection (e)(2) (subsection (5)(b) in C.R.S.) protects a transferee who acquires a debtor’s interest in an asset as a result of the enforcement of a secured creditor’s rights pursuant to and in compliance with the provisions of Part 5 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Cf. Calaiaro v. Pittsburgh Nat’l Bank (In re Ewing), 33 B.R. 288, 9 C.B.C.2d 526, CCH B.L.R. paragraph 69,460 (Bk.W.D.Pa. 1983) (sale of pledged stock held subject to avoidance as fraudulent transfer in § 548 of the Bankruptcy Code), rev’d, 36 B.R. 476 (W.D.Pa. 1984) (transfer held not voidable because deemed to have occurred more than one year before bankruptcy petition filed). Although a secured creditor may enforce rights in collateral without a sale under § 9-502 or § 9-505 of the Code, the creditor must proceed in good faith (U.C.C. § 9-103) and in a “commercially reasonable” manner. The “commercially reasonable” constraint is explicit in U.C.C. § 9-502(2) and is implicit in § 9-505. See 2 G. Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property 1224-27 (1965).

       <li id="t38a08s38-8-109-officialcommentol16">
        Subsection (f) (subsection (6) in C.R.S.) provides additional defenses against the avoidance of a preferential transfer to an insider under § 5(b) (section 38-8-106 (2) in C.R.S.).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Paragraph (1) (paragraph (a) in C.R.S.) is adapted from § 547(c)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, which permits a preferred creditor to set off the amount of new value subsequently advanced against the recovery of a voidable preference by a trustee in bankruptcy to the debtor without security. The new value may consist not only of money, goods, or services delivered on unsecured credit but also of the release of a valid lien. See, e.g., In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co., 424 F.2d 722, 724 (2d Cir. 1970); Baranow v. Gibraltor Factors Corp. (In re Hygrade Envelope Co.), 393 F.2d 60, 65-67 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 837 (1968); In re John Morrow &amp; Co., 134 F.686, 688 (S.D.Ohio 1901). It does not include an obligation substituted for a prior obligation. If the insider receiving the preference thereafter extends new credit to the debtor but also takes security from the debtor, the injury to the other creditors resulting from the preference remains undiminished by the new credit. On the other hand, if a lien taken to secure the new credit is itself voidable by a judicial lien creditor of the debtor, the new value received by the debtor may appropriately be treated as unsecured and applied to reduce the liability of the insider for the preferential transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (2) (paragraph (b) in C.R.S.) is derived from § 546(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, which excepts certain payments made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs from avoidance by the trustee in bankruptcy as preferential transfers. Whether a transfer was in the “ordinary course” requires a consideration of the pattern of payments or secured transactions engaged in by the debtor and the insider prior to the transfer challenged under § 5(b) (section 38-8-106 (2) in C.R.S.). See Tait &amp; Williams, Bankruptcy Preference Laws: The Scope of Section 547(c)(2), 99 Banking L.J. 55, 63-66 (1982). The defense provided by paragraph (2) is available, irrespective of whether the debtor or the insider or both are engaged in business, but the prior conduct or practice of both the debtor and the insider-transferee is relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (3) (paragraph (c) in C.R.S.) is new and reflects a policy judgment that an insider who has previously extended credit to a debtor should not be deterred from extending further credit to the debtor in a good faith effort to save the debtor from a forced liquidation in bankruptcy or otherwise. A similar rationale has sustained the taking of security from an insolvent debtor for an advance to enable the debtor to stave off bankruptcy and extricate itself from financial stringency. Blackman v. Bechtel, 80 F.2d 505, 508-09 (8th Cir. 1935); Olive v. Tyler (In re Chelan Land Co.), 257 F.497, 5 A.L.R. 561 (9th Cir. 1919); In re Robin Bros. Bakeries, Inc., 22 F.S. 662, 663-64 (N.D.Ill. 1937); see Dean v. Davis, 242 U.S. 438, 444 (1917). The amount of the present value given, the size of the antecedent debt secured, and the likelihood of success for the rehabilitative effort are relevant considerations in determining whether the transfer was in good faith.

        Whether “reasonably equivalent value” has been received is a question of fact.
       </b>
       What constitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for the transfer requires an analysis of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction. The standard of reasonably equivalent value implies a rule of reasonableness in light of the particular circumstances. Reasonable equivalence is not synonymous with market value, even though market value is an important factor to be utilized in the assessment. For purposes of the Colorado Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, equity looks to the substance of the transaction rather than its form. Krol v. Unglaub, 332 B.R. 303 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2005).

        This section is new. Its purpose is to make clear that lapse of the statutory periods prescribed by the section bars the right and not merely the remedy. See Restatement of Conflict of Laws 2d § 143 Comments (b) and (c) (1971). The section rejects the rule applied in United States v. Gleneagles Inv. Co., 565 F.S. 556, 583 (M.D.Pa. 1983) (state statute of limitations held not to apply to action by United States based on Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act).

        Statutes of limitations applicable to the avoidance of fraudulent transfers and obligations vary widely from state to state and are frequently subject to uncertainties in their application. See Hesson, The Statute of Limitations in Actions to Set Aside Fraudulent Conveyances and in Actions Against Directors by Creditors of Corporations, 32 Cornell L.Q. 222 (1946); Annos., 76 A.L.R. 864 (1932), 128 A.L.R. 1289 (1940), 133 A.L.R. 1311 (1941), 14 A.L.R.2d 598 (1950), and 100 A.L.R.2d 1094 (1965). Together with § 6 (section 38-8-107 in C.R.S.), this section should mitigate the uncertainty and diversity that have characterized the decisions applying statutes of limitations to actions to fraudulent transfers and obligations. The periods prescribed apply, whether the action under this Act is brought by the creditor defrauded or by a purchaser at a sale on execution levied pursuant to § 7(b) (section 38-8-108 (2) in C.R.S.) and whether the action is brought against the original transferee or subsequent transferee. The prescription of statutory periods of limitation does not preclude the barring of an avoidance action for laches. See § 10 (section 38-8-111 in C.R.S.) and the accompanying Comment infra.

      <p>
       This section is derived from § 11 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and § 1-103 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The section adds a reference to “laches” in recognition of the particular appropriateness of the application of this equitable doctrine to an untimely action to avoid a fraudulent transfer. See Louis Dreyfus Corp. v. Butler, 496 F.2d 806, 808 (6th Cir. 1974) (action to avoid transfers to debtor’s wife when debtor was engaged in speculative business held to be barred by laches or applicable statutes of limitations); Cooch v. Grier, 30 Del.Ch. 255, 265-66, 59 A.2d 282, 287-88 (1948) (action under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act held barred by laches when the creditor was chargeable with inexcusable delay and the defendant was prejudiced by the delay).

         Proof of parol agreement prohibited absent fraud, accident, or mistake.
        </b>
        In the absence of the elements of fraud, accident, or mistake, the grantor in an absolute conveyance is prohibited by the statute of frauds from setting up and proving a parol agreement, in which the grantee was to hold the land in trust for his benefit. Hall v. Linn, 8 Colo. 264, 5 P. 641 (1885); Bohm v. Bohm, 9 Colo. 100, 10 P. 790 (1885); Von Trotha v. Bamberger, 15 Colo. 1, 24 P. 883 (1890).

         Situations giving rise to resulting trusts.
        </b>
        There are three situations in which the trust which arises is properly called a resulting trust: (1) Where an express trust fails in whole or in part; (2) where an express trust is fully performed without exhausting the trust estate; and (3) where property is purchased and the purchase price is paid by one person and at his direction the vendor conveys the property to another person.

       </p>
       <p>
        A trust in operation of law may occur where a trust is declared only as to part of the conveyance and nothing is said as to rest. Walker v. Bruce, 44 Colo. 109, 97 P. 250 (1908).

         When constructive trust operates.
        </b>
        It has been held that a constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression; when property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee. Page v. Clark, 197 Colo. 306, 592 P.2d 792 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where legal title to land has been fraudulently acquired, and is still held in fraud of the rights of another having a valuable interest in the premises, a trust by operation of law may be declared upon equitable terms. Learned v. Tritch, 6 Colo. 432 (1882); Kayser v. Maugham, 8 Colo. 232, 6 P. 803 (1885); Stewart v. Stevens, 10 Colo. 440, 15 P. 786 (1887); Von Trotha v.

         Setting aside transaction for abuse of confidential relationship.
        </b>
        If the existence of a confidential relationship has been established, a transaction may be set aside if that relationship has been abused. It is not necessary that the abuse of the confidential relationship be the procuring cause of the original conveyance, but rather the refusal to perform the promise to reconvey is itself a sufficient abuse of confidence to allow the conveyance to be set aside.

        In order to escape the bar of the statute of frauds, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to prove, among other things, that they reasonably reposed confidence and trust in the promisor at the time of the negotiations leading to the oral agreement at issue and that, but for such confidential relationship, such oral agreement would have been reduced to writing.

         Verbal agreements for profits and contracts for land may be independent.
        </b>
        A verbal agreement to share the profits arising from the purchase and sale of real estate may be made independent of any contract for an interest in the land itself. Kayser v. Maugham, 8 Colo. 232, 6 P. 803 (1885); Von Trotha v. Bamberger, 15 Colo. 1, 24 P. 883 (1890).

         Oral agreement for perpetual right-of-way constitutes easement.
        </b>
        An oral agreement for a perpetual right-of-way over the premises of another constitutes an easement or interest in land and is within the statute of frauds. Whitsett v. Kershow, 4 Colo. 419 (1878); Ward v. Farwell, 6 Colo. 66 (1881); Stewart v. Stevens, 10 Colo. 440, 15 P. 786 (1887); Fetta v. Vandevier, 3 Colo. App. 419, 34 P. 168 (1893), aff’d, Vandevier v.

         Agreement for joint benefit of several persons not within section.

        Agreement between two or more persons to explore the public domain and discover and locate lodes for the joint benefit of all is not within this section, and it is not necessary that it should be written.

        Where one enters upon a mine previously discovered, and to which the discoverer has lost his right by failing to make the development required by the law; from the moment of commencing the labor of development with the bona fide purpose to complete it, and so appropriate the mine, the party has a possession in fact, and for the time being a right to retain that possession, and this right is, perhaps, such an interest in land as cannot be contracted for or disposed of without writing. Murley v. Ennis, 2 Colo. 300 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Subsequent oral modification unenforceable.
        </b>
        A contract for the sale of land required to be in writing cannot be validly changed or modified as to a material condition, by a subsequent oral agreement, without more, so as to make the original written agreement, as orally modified, an enforceable obligation. Burnford v. Blanning, 189 Colo. 292, 540 P.2d 337 (1975).

         Exceptions to unenforceability of subsequent oral modification.
        </b>
        Exceptions to general rule that contracts for sale of land cannot be modified by subsequent parol agreement include: (1) When subsequent oral agreement amounts to revocation of written contract; and (2) when party consents to, or requests postponement of, performance by other party which is for his benefit and other party has acted on such request or consent. Urton &amp; Co. v. Poznik, 181 Colo. 15, 506 P.2d 741 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contracts for the sale of land can be modified by subsequent oral agreement if a party consents to or requests a postponement of performance by the other party which is for the requesting party’s benefit and the other party has acted thereon.

        <b>
         When oral agreement not violative of statute.
        </b>
        Where an oral modification agreed to by the parties has been performed, a contract which affects interests in real property may be modified as to a material condition by a subsequent oral agreement without violating the statute of frauds.

While the phrase “internal reference” is often used to describe the requisite nexus, it need not be in the form of express cross-references between the writings. Instead, the requirement may be satisfied by parol evidence where it is apparent that the memoranda referred to the same subject matter or transaction. Bennett v. Moring, 33 Colo.

        An oral contract for a one-fourth interest in the water of a spring, based on a valuable consideration, and which is performed by both parties, except as to the expenses that may arise in the future, is such a complete performance on both sides as will remove the bar of the statute.

       <p>
        <b>
         Standards used in determining part performance.
        </b>
        Part performance consists of performing something required by the contract, such as the payment of rent, plus the taking of possession by the tenant and the installation of trade fixtures or other similar equipment of a type that is indicative of a long-term tenancy. A &amp; R Co. v. Union Air Transp., Inc., 738 P.2d 73 (Colo. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party relying on part performance to defeat a defense based on the statute of frauds must show that the partial performance is more consistent with the terms of the contract than with some other arrangement, such as a month-to-month tenancy or a tenancy at will. A &amp; R Co. v. Union Air Transp., Inc., 738 P.2d 73 (Colo. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere possession of property is not substantial part performance if possession may be attributed to some arrangement other than the one under the alleged oral agreement. A &amp; R Co. v. Union Air Transp., Inc., 738 P.2d 73 (Colo. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In many cases where part performance has been allowed to defeat a statute of frauds defense, either a tenant or a putative owner has taken possession of the premises and made extensive improvements or expenditures in preparing to occupy the property in reliance on an oral agreement. A &amp; R Co. v. Union Air Transp., Inc., 738 P.2d 73 (Colo. App. 1987).

       <p>
        <b>
         Specific performance enforceable for part performance.
        </b>
        Specific performance of an oral contract will be enforced in favor of one who has partly performed it. Van Trotha v. Bamberger, 15 Colo. 1, 24 P. 883 (1890); Knoff v. Grace, 68 Colo. 527, 190 P. 526 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Essential contract terms must be established to justify specific performance of parole contract.
        </b>
        In order to justify the specific performance of a parol contract for the sale of land on the ground of part performance, it is necessary that all the essential terms of the contract must first be established by competent evidence and shown to be definite, certain, clear, and unambiguous. Mestas v. Martini, 113 Colo. 108, 155 P.2d 161 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the purchaser of lands has partly performed under a verbal contract, he can recover for what he has done in pursuance of the oral agreement where the vendor insists upon the statute of frauds and refuses to perform. Colo. Lumber, Land, &amp; Imp. Co. v. Dustin, 38 Colo. 398, 87 P. 1142 (1906); Drier v. Sherwood, 77 Colo. 539, 238 P. 38 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Sufficient consideration required for enforceability of agreement.
        </b>
        An agreement, whether within or without the statute of frauds, must be founded upon a sufficient consideration before a court of equity will enforce it. Beulah Marble Co. v. Mattice, 22 Colo. 547, 45 P. 432 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Cause of performance other than contract alleged insufficient.
        </b>
        What is fairly referable to some cause other than the contract as alleged will not be regarded as sufficient part performance to justify a decree of specific performance. Von Trotha v. Bamberger, 15 Colo. 1, 24 P. 883 (1890); Knoff v. Grace, 68 Colo. 527, 190 P. 526 (1920).

       <p>
        <b>
         Requisites for rescission of oral contract for land purchase.
        </b>
        Where a party has rendered services, or paid money, in consideration of an oral contract for the purchase of land, he cannot rescind such contract and recover for such services, or the money paid, unless the other party insists upon the statute of frauds, and refuses to perform it on his part. Colo. Lumber, Land, &amp; Imp. Co. v. Dustin, 38 Colo. 398, 87 P. 1142 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Evidence of parol contract inadmissible where written contract alleged.
        </b>
        In an action for specific performance of a contract to convey land, where the complaint alleges a written contract, evidence of a parol contract taken out of the statute of frauds by part performance is inadmissible to support the action. People’s Mining &amp; Milling Co. v. Central Consol. Mines Corp., 20 Colo. App. 561, 80 P. 479 (1905).

         A trial court has discretion to grant the equitable relief of specific performance

        <b>
         Part performance removes contract from bar of statute of frauds.
        </b>
        Part performance of a contract removes it from the bar of the statute of frauds. Ridgeway v. Pope, 163 Colo. 160, 430 P.2d 77 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Acts of part performance must be pursuant to verbal contract.
        </b>
        Acts of part performance, such as will furnish a foundation for enforcing a verbal contract respecting land otherwise void under the statute of frauds, must be such as are done in pursuance, or according to the terms, of the contract, and which in some manner affect or change the relation of the parties in respect to the property whereby one of the parties would be defrauded if the contract were not enforced. Von Trotha v. Bamberger, 15 Colo. 1, 24 P. 883 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Absent agreement, no acts of part performance would exist.
        </b>
        The part performance, which will bring a contract within the provisions of this section, must consist of an act or of acts which it clearly appears the performing party would not have done in the absence of the agreement or without a direct view to its performance. Horton v. Stegmyer, 175 F. 756, 20 Ann. Cas. 1134 (8th Cir. 1913); Brown v. Johanson, 69 Colo. 400, 194 P. 943 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Money expended for labor and building materials constitute part performance.
        </b>
        Where persons expended from $1,200 to $1,500 in labor and materials in building their home on another’s land in reliance on owner’s consent, it is clearly apparent that there was sufficient part performance to overcome the defense of the statute of frauds. Zamboni v. Graham, 104 Colo. 23, 88 P.2d 98 (1939); Hill v. Chambers, 136 Colo. 129, 314 P.2d 707 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Actual possession and making improvements constitute sufficient part performance.
        </b>
        The most important acts which constitute a sufficient part performance to authorize courts of equity to decree specific performance are actual possession, and the making of permanent and valuable improvements. Hunt v. Hayt, 10 Colo. 278, 15 P. 410 (1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff solicited defendant to quit his ranch, move to town, take possession of, furnish, and conduct a hotel on certain premises, promising that if he would do so, he, plaintiff, would execute to him a lease of the hotel at a specified rent for a specified term of years, and the defendant complied with this request, removed from his ranch, assumed possession of, and furnished, the hotel, and paid rentals monthly for several months, such acts constitute a sufficient part performance to entitle defendant to specific performance of the contract lease. Adcock v. Lieber, 51 Colo. 373, 117 P. 993 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Mere possession will not be deemed part performance
        </b>
        sufficient to justify such relief when it may fairly be referable to some other cause than the execution of the contract. Von Trotha v. Bamberger, 15 Colo. 1, 24 P. 883 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Plaintiff has burden of proof.
        </b>
        In an action to compel defendant to execute a written lease to premises for a term of two years, the burden of proof was upon plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he and the defendant made an oral contract for a written lease of the premises for a period of two years and, that in reliance upon this contract, he had entered into possession and partly performed it. Kiter v. Owen, 115 Colo. 7, 168 P.2d 254 (1946).

         IV. PROMISE TO ANSWER FOR THE DEBT OF ANOTHER.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Promise is considered original when given for promisor’s benefit,
        </b>
        rather than to secure credit for a third party debtor. Cramblit v. Chateau Motel, Inc., 28 Colo. App. 213, 472, P.2d 183 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        A promise by one, for himself, to pay for services rendered to another, is an original promise, and binding without writing. Tuttle v. Welty, 46 Colo. 25, 102 P. 1069 (1909); Spelts v. Anderson, 67 Colo. 63, 185 P. 468 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one, to promote his own interest, promises to pay the debt of another, the transaction constitutes an original contract and is not within the statute of frauds. Spelts v. Anderson, 67 Colo. 63, 185 P. 468 (1919); Moon v. Greenlee, 69 Colo. 482, 195 P. 1100 (1921); Takamine v. Hirschfeld, 81 Colo. 501, 256 P. 312 (1927); Ady v. Weicker Transf. &amp; Storage Co., 97 Colo. 230, 48 P.2d 807 (1935); Mayer Oil Co. v. Schnepf, 100 Colo. 578, 69 P.2d 775 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        An agreement by a debtor to pay his creditor’s obligation to a third party has never been regarded as a collateral promise, but wherever it is entered into upon a sufficient consideration and is accepted by the party to whom the money is to be paid, it has always been deemed an original promise, and enforceable by the party who is entitled to its advantages. Thatcher v. Rockwell, 4 Colo. 375 (1878), aff’d, 105 U.S. 467, 26 L. Ed. 949 (1881); Mulvany v. Gross, 1 Colo. App. 112, 27 P. 878 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        The promise of one person, though in form to answer for the debt of another, if founded upon a new and sufficient consideration, moving from the creditor and promised to the promisor, and beneficial to the latter, is not within the statute of frauds, and need not be in writing. Green v. Morrison, 5 Colo. 18 (1879); De Walt v. Hartzell, 7 Colo. 601, 4 P. 1201 (1884); Maxwell v. Dell, 11 Colo. 415, 18 P. 561 (1888); Mulvany v. Gross, 1 Colo. App. 112, 27 P. 878 (1891); Green v. Latcham, 2 Colo. App. 416, 31 P. 233 (1892); Fisk v. Reser, 19 Colo. 88, 34 P. 572 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        Promise of the secretary of a corporation to pay a balance for printing stock certificates if printer “would go ahead” and print them, which he did is an original promise and not within the statute of frauds. Takamine v. Hirschfeld, 81 Colo. 501, 256 P. 312 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        An oral promise is collateral and thus barred by the statute of frauds, if the leading object of the promise is to become a surety or guarantor on the debt of another; the promise is original when the performance of the agreement directly benefits the promisor. Idealco, Inc. v. Gunnin, 746 P.2d 69 (Colo. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        An original oral promise will only be enforced if the accrual of the benefit to the promisor is contingent upon performance by the promisee. Idealco, Inc. v. Gunnin, 746 P.2d 69 (Colo. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Applicability of subsection (1)(b).
        </b>
        A bank, which ignorantly pays money to the holder of an instrument upon the faith of a third person’s statement that he knows the holder to be the payee and which is afterwards compelled to pay the amount to the true payee, may recover the sum from the third person in an action for damages occasioned by the deceit, and subsection (1)(b) cannot be invoked in behalf of the defendant in such case, because his liability does not grow out of any special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another, nor upon any agreement required to be in writing. Lahay v. City Nat’l Bank, 15 Colo. 339, 25 P. 704 (1890).
       </p>
       <p class="navhead1">
        <b>
         Part performance which will withdraw a promise covered by subsection (1)(b)
        </b>
        from the statute must consist of acts from which it clearly appears that the performing party would not have done in the absence of the agreement. Masinton v. Dean, 659 P.2d 50 (Colo. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         What is done as part performance must be consistent
        </b>
        with no theory other than the oral agreement, otherwise it does not tend to prove the latter. Masinton v. Dean, 659 P.2d 50 (Colo. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         To be binding collateral agreement must be in writing.
        </b>
        An agreement, if it is not collateral, but in the nature of an original agreement to pay the debt of another, founded on a sufficient consideration received by the promisor himself, is not within the provisions of subsection (1)(b), and therefore, need not be in writing; but, if the agreement to answer for the debt of another be wholly collateral, it must be in writing. Thatcher v. Rockwell, 4 Colo. 375 (1878), aff’d, 105 U.S. 467, 26 L. Ed. 949 (1881); Fisk v. Reser, 19 Colo. 88, 34 P. 572 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Words importing collateral undertaking.
        </b>
        The words, “we will see the articles paid for”, or equivalent words, standing alone and uncontrolled by circumstances showing a contrary intent, import a collateral undertaking, and are within the statute of frauds. Wagner v. Hallack, 3 Colo. 176 (1877); Clayton Coal Co. v. King, 108 Colo. 63, 113 P.2d 672 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the president of an insolvent bank presented to one of the directors, who was also a depositor, a release of his claim in the latter capacity, and to induce the execution thereof, said to the director: “You shall have your money out of the assets of the bank if this settlement goes through.” “I will take the assets of the bank, and make the money out of them, and you shall have every nickel.” “You shall have all your money back, with interest.” These words were a promise to pay the debt of the bank and the oral agreement is void under subsection (1)(b). Freeman v. Hampton, 67 Colo. 90, 185 P. 251 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant said concerning lumber purchased by another: “If he doesn’t pay for it, I will”, this is not an original undertaking, but a collateral promise and within the statute of frauds. Seal v. Colo. Coal &amp; Lumber Co., 79 Colo. 141, 244 P. 469 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Agreement within statute where object is to become guarantor to promisee.
        </b>
        When the leading object of the promise or agreement is to become guarantor or surety to the promisee for a debt for which a third party is and continues to be primarily liable, the agreement, whether made before or after, or at the time with the promise of the principal, is within the statute of frauds and not binding unless evidenced by writing. Cramblit v. Chateau Motel, Inc., 28 Colo. App. 213, 472 P.2d 183 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff sold to a tenant goods and charged them upon his books to such tenant, a promise by the landlord to pay such account, made without consideration, was a promise to pay the debt of another within subsection (1)(b), and was not binding unless made in writing. Burson v. Bogart, 18 Colo. App. 449, 72 P. 605 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Full performance of promise by plaintiff removes matter from statute.
        </b>
        Assuming that the alleged promises of the defendants amounted to a special promise to answer for the debt of another person, the full performance on the part of plaintiff of the acts required of him under the oral agreement would remove the case from the statute of frauds. Schust v. Perington, 169 Colo. 39, 453 P.2d 599 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Promise to pay another’s debt for consideration not within statute.
        </b>
        Where one promises to pay the debt of another in consideration of money or property received from the debtor for the expressed purpose of paying the debt, the promise is not within the statute of frauds. Hughes v. Fisher, 10 Colo. 383, 15 P. 702 (1887); Durkee v. Conklin, 13 Colo. App. 313, 57 P. 486 (1899); Cerrusite Mining Co. v. Steele, 18 Colo. App. 216, 70 P. 1091 (1902); McIntire v. Schiffer, 31 Colo. 246, 72 P. 1056 (1903); Burson v. Bogart, 49 Colo. 410, 113 P. 516 (1911); Argys v. McGlothlen, 130 Colo. 490, 276 P.2d 983 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, after the plaintiff refused to sell supplies to a corporation lacking credit, the defendant then said: “Charge these things to me, and let the boys at the mine have what they need”, the promise was original rather than collateral or of guaranty; hence, not within the statute. Redington v. Jenkins-McKay Hdwe. Co., 111 Colo. 363, 141 P.2d 891 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Return to work on promise of payment of wages not within statute.
        </b>
        Where oil drillers ceased work because of default of payment of their wages by the original contractor, and returned to work on the promise of officers of the owner company that the latter would see that their wages were paid, the promise is not within the statute of frauds. Mayer Oil Co. v. Schnepf, 100 Colo. 578, 69 P.2d 775 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Promise to assume notes for purchase of property not within statute.
        </b>
        Where defendants purchased property of plaintiffs incumbered by trust deed, and orally agreed to assume the notes secured thereby, such promise is not an agreement to answer for the debt of another person within the meaning of subsection (1)(b). Enos v. Anderson, 40 Colo. 395, 93 P. 475 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Payment of note in exchange for conveyance of property not within statute.
        </b>
        A promise to a debtor to pay his debt in consideration of the conveyance of property to the promisor is not within the statute of frauds. Enos v. Anderson, 40 Colo. 395, 93 P. 475 (1907); Burson v. Bogart, 49 Colo. 410, 113 P. 516 (1911); United States Mining Corp. v. Fred Goble, Inc., 82 Colo. 59, 256 P. 1091 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in exchange for property conveyed to her by her husband, the wife promised to pay off the husband’s note, the agreement was nothing more than a promise to perform an obligation in consideration of which the lands were conveyed to her; this agreement constituted an original contract by the wife, not within the statute of frauds. Green v. Richardson, 4 Colo. 584 (1879); McIntire v. Schiffer, 31 Colo. 246, 72 P. 1056 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where agreement not promise to pay another’s debt.
        </b>
        An agreement to place a person’s name upon a settlement check is not a promise to pay the debt of another, although performance of the promise may result in the discharge of the debt of another. Davis v. Ciancio, 172 Colo. 54, 470 P.2d 30 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Partnership, agreeing that a loan to one of partners would be a partnership debt, is a direct and not collateral agreement and does not come within the statute. Kelsey v. Munson, 198 F. 841 (8th Cir. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        A contract, by which certain expert witnesses were to testify in behalf of the managing officers of a mining corporation in an action against them for sending fraudulent statements through the mail in regard to the values of its properties, is a direct promise to pay the stipulated fees and expenses of the corporation and is not a contract to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another within this section. Lincoln Mt. Gold Mining Co. v. Williams, 37 Colo. 193, 85 P. 844 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Test for liability for debt of another.
        </b>
        The test for whether one by an oral promise becomes liable for the debts of another is whether or not a promise has been made as a surety of the debtor or as an original undertaking by the promisor. Seal v. Colo. Coal &amp; Lumber Co., 79 Colo. 141, 244 P. 469 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Debtor and creditor may sue for breach of promise.
        </b>
        Upon the breach of a promise to pay the debt of another in consideration of money or property received from the debtor, not only the debtor himself, but the creditor, may sue, even though the promise is made to the debtor alone. Argys v. McGlothlen, 130 Colo. 490, 276 P.2d 983 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Plaintiff has burden of establishing that oral promise asserted was original
        </b>
        and unconditional and thus amounted to an assumption by defendant of the direct liability for goods thereafter furnished to third parties. Clayton Coal Co. v. King, 108 Colo. 63, 113 P.2d 672 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Novation of a guaranty is an original agreement
        </b>
        rather than a collateral agreement and thus not within the purview of the statute of frauds. Moffat County State Bank v. Told, 780 P.2d 11 (Colo. App. 1989), aff’d, 800 P.2d 1320 (Colo. 1990).

        <b>
         Writing required for antenuptial agreement.
        </b>
        Antenuptial agreements conveying lands are included in that class of contracts required by this section to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, as equity will not permit subsection (1)(c) to be made an instrument for the perpetration of a fraud. Moore v. Allen, 26 Colo. 197, 57 P. 698, 77 Am. St. R. 255 (1899).

         Widow’s violation of antenuptial contract manifested bad faith.
        </b>
        Where an oral contract was entered into between a husband and wife before their marriage wherein it was agreed that their property rights should not be affected by the marriage, and subsequent to their marriage they executed a written agreement in which each waived and released all right to the property of the other, and where the husband left a will in which no provision was made for the widow who attempted to repudiate both contracts as void, her violation of the solemn contracts was a manifestation of bad faith and ought not to be tolerated. Remington v. Remington, 69 Colo. 206, 193 P. 550 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>

        In an action of replevin for property claimed by the plaintiff under a sale to him by a third person, the defendant, who was neither a creditor of, nor a subsequent purchaser from, such third person, could not attack the validity of the transfer of the property between such third person and the plaintiff on the ground of no actual change of possession.

         II. SUFFICIENT DELIVERY AND CHANGE OF POSSESSION.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Acts necessary to constitute sufficient delivery and change of possession
        </b>
        depend in a great measure upon the nature and situation of the property. Crymble v. Mulvaney, 21 Colo. 203, 40 P. 499 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Determination of sufficient delivery.
        </b>
        If there is a full surrender upon the part of the vendor and a full assumption on the part of the vendee of the control and dominion of the subject of the sale, the delivery is sufficient. Cook v. Mann, 6 Colo. 21 (1881); Wilcox v. Jackson, 7 Colo. 521, 4 P. 966 (1884); Bassinger v. Spangler, 9 Colo. 175, 10 P. 809 (1886); Sweeney v. Coe, 12 Colo. 485, 21 P. 705 (1889); Herr v. Denver Milling &amp; Mercantile Co., 13 Colo. 406, 22 P. 770 (1889); Atchison v. Graham, 14 Colo. 217, 23 P. 876 (1890); Felt v. Cleghorn, 2 Colo. App. 4, 29 P. 813 (1892); Springer v. Kreeger, 3 Colo. App. 487, 34 P. 269 (1893); Crymble v. Mulvaney, 21 Colo. 203, 40 P. 499 (1895); Hugus &amp; Co. v. Hardenburg, 19 Colo. App. 464, 76 P. 543 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, at the time of the sale, chattels were not in the physical possession of the vendor but were under his control, and where the sale was not accompanied by an immediate delivery to the bank, or any delivery, nor was it followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things sold, the sale is void. Reed v. Ardway State Bank, 102 Colo. 266, 78 P.2d 624 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires the removal of the property sold from the custody and control of the vendor whenever removal is possible, notwithstanding any expense or hardship the removal may entail. Burchinell v. Weinberger, 4 Colo. App. 6, 34 P. 911 (1893); Crymble v. Mulvaney, 21 Colo. 203, 40 P. 499 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Requirements of change of possession.
        </b>
        The vendee of chattels must take actual possession of the articles sold, and the possession must be open, notorious, unequivocal, and such as to apprise the community that the goods have changed hands or that the sale is void as to creditors of the vendor. Bassinger v. Spangler, 9 Colo. 175, 10 P. 809 (1886); Sweeney v. Coe, 12 Colo. 485, 21 P. 705 (1889); Lloyd v. Williams, 6 Colo. App. 157, 40 P. 243 (1895); Willis v. Roberts, 18 Colo. App. 149, 70 P. 445 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        The necessity of clear, unequivocal, and unmistakable change of possession, and retention of such possession by the vendee, has been properly, fully, and clearly asserted by the supreme court. Cook v. Mann, 6 Colo. 21 (1881); Wilcox v. Jackson, 7 Colo. 521, 4 P. 966 (1884); Herr v. Denver Milling &amp; Mercantile Co., 13 Colo. 406, 22 P. 770 (1889); Baur v. Beall, 14 Colo. 383, 23 P. 345 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possession taken by a purchaser of personalty must be actual, continued, visible, open, notorious, unequivocal, and exclusive. Cook v. Mann, 6 Colo. 21 (1881); Davis v. Patterson, 69 Colo. 226, 193 P. 662 (1920); Acott v. Sterling Hdwe. &amp; Implement Co., 74 Colo. 195, 219 P. 1073 (1923); Fish v. East, 114 F.2d 177 (10th Cir. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Sale void absent visible indicia of change of ownership.
        </b>
        The sale of a stock of goods in a store is void as no indicia of a change of ownership were visible, where the sign of the former proprietor, who made the sale, was permitted to remain on the building, the vendor frequented the store after the sale and occasionally made sales of goods himself; therefore, the retention of the old sign amounted to a declaration to the public that the former proprietor was still proprietor of the store and it gave to the transaction an equivocal character. Bassinger v. Spangler, 9 Colo. 175, 10 P. 809 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Gift of automobile by parent to minor child void as to creditors.
        </b>
        Gift of an automobile by a parent to a minor child residing with him, unaccompanied by delivery and continued change of possession, is void as to creditors. Wilcoxen v. Morgan, 2 Colo. 473 (1875); Bassinger v. Spangler, 9 Colo. 175, 10 P. 809 (1886); Bartell v. Griffin, 47 Colo. 569, 108 P. 171 (1910); Goad v. Corrington, 61 Colo. 427, 158 P. 284 (1916); Davis v. Patterson, 69 Colo. 226, 193 P. 662 (1920); Chavez v. Haynie, 75 Colo. 414, 225 P. 852 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Purchaser’s placing goods in locked room constituted possession.
        </b>
        Where a purchaser of goods obtained possession thereof, put them in a room over which the vendor had no control, locked them up, took the key away, leaving a notice on the door that the goods were his, his possession satisfied the requirements of this section. Conly v. Friedman, 6 Colo. App. 160, 40 P. 348 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Conditional sale not avoided by vendor’s continued possession.
        </b>
        Where a bill of sale is made under an oral agreement that it shall be delivered only upon the happening of a certain event, the sale, being conditional, is not avoided by the fact that the vendor continued in possession until performance of the condition. Roberts v. Hawn, 20 Colo. 77, 36 P. 886 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         If conditional sale is rescinded, seller is bound
        </b>
        to immediately take and keep actual and continued possession of the personalty in order to make the transaction available against the buyer’s creditors. Coors v. Reagan, 44 Colo. 126, 96 P. 966 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Rights of subsequent purchaser taking with knowledge of prior transaction.
        </b>
        Where a sale of chattels is completed as between the parties thereto, but the possession temporarily remains with the vendor, a subsequent purchaser who has knowledge of the prior transaction takes subject to the rights of the prior vendee. McKee v. Bassick Mining Co., 8 Colo. 392, 8 P. 561 (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Evidence admissible to determine actual change of possession of goods.
        </b>
        Where the issue is as to whether an actual change of possession of the goods took place, the books of the warehouse in which they were stored, at and after the time of the sale, are admissible to show whether or not there has been such a change. Springer v. Kreeger, 3 Colo. App. 487, 34 P. 269 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Concurrent or joint possession inadmissible.
        </b>

Spangler, 9 Colo. 175, 10 P. 809 (1886); Atchison v. Graham, 14 Colo. 217, 23 P. 876 (1890); Donovan v. Gathe, 3 Colo. App. 151, 32 P. 436 (1893); Bartell v.

         Recording of bill of sale not notice to creditors.
        </b>

        <b>
         Rights of parties unaffected by transfer subsequent to sale.
        </b>
        The rights of the parties are not at all affected by any transfer which may be made subsequent to the time of the sale, even though the transfer may occur before any actual levy on the goods by creditors who have sued out attachments or have issued executions. Cook v. Mann, 6 Colo. 21 (1881); Ray v. Raymond, 8 Colo. 467, 9 P. 15 (1885); Bassinger v. Spangler, 9 Colo. 175, 10 P. 809 (1886); Sweeney v. Coe, 12 Colo. 485, 21 P. 705 (1889); Atchison v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Creditor’s knowledge of fraudulent sale inmaterial.

       </p>
       <p>
        A sale, not accompanied by delivery and followed by actual and continued change of possession, is fraudulent and void as to creditors of the vendor, notwithstanding such creditors had actual notice of the sale.

         Hindering and delaying construed.

        The hindering and delaying meant by this section as vitiating an assignment is that hindrance and delay intended to be produced by the assignor through covin and malice, or for his own benefit and advantage. Burr v. Clement, 9 Colo. 1, 9 P. 633 (1885).

        Transferee liable under subsection (1) because conveyance was made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, in this case, the internal revenue service. While structuring the sale of the assets of the insolvent company, corporate executive (transferee) obtained multiple opinions on the foreseeable tax consequences.

        <b>
         Intent of conveyance necessary determination.
        </b>
        The necessary and material thing to bring a case within the protection of this section is not that the party invoking its aid should have an existing cause of action or demand at the time the conveyance is made, but that the grantor intended by such conveyance to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors or other persons in the manner set forth in this section. Gregory v. Filbeck, 12 Colo. 379, 21 P. 489 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is true that a fraudulent intent must be participated in by both parties, grantor and grantee, or mortgagor and mortgagee, when such is the case, the conveyance or mortgage is null and void. Livingston v. Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co., 12 Colo. App. 331, 56 P. 355 (1898); Fish v. East, 114 F.2d 177 (10th Cir. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        A sale of property, though for a full consideration, may be void, if made by the owner with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, and if the vendee participated in such intent. Helm v. Brewster, 42 Colo. 25, 93 P. 1101 (1908); Reithmann v. Godsman, 23 Colo. 202, 46 P. 684 (1896); Fish v. East, 114 F.2d 177 (10th Cir. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Intent need only be to hinder or delay payment.
        </b>
        That the transferor did not intend to defraud his creditors will not defeat a suit to void a transfer as fraudulent. If the transferor’s intent was merely to hinder or to delay the payment of his creditors, the transfer will be voided. United States v. Morgan, 554 F. Supp. 582 (D. Colo. 1982).

        <b>
         Burden of proof to show that a conveyance is honest
        </b>
        and made in good faith for valuable consideration and without intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors is on the transferee and transferor. In re Genova v. Champion, 33 B.R. 930 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Once a bankruptcy trustee shows a family transfer, burden of proof shifts
        </b>
        to the transferee and transferor to show that the transfer was honest and that there was no intent to defraud. Also, the burden of proof of solvency is upon the debtor and the transferee and not upon the trustee. In re Genova v. Champion, 33 B.R. 930 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1983).

       <p>
        <b>
         Void transfer invalid even between parties.
        </b>
        Where an attempted transfer by deed of a party’s interest in property is set aside as an attempt to defraud creditors, it is invalid as between the parties to the deed. Park State Bank v. McLean, 660 P.2d 13 (Colo. App. 1982).

         Action by judgment creditor to set aside conveyance maintainable.

        <b>
         Bar to money judgments implicit in remedy.
        </b>
        Implicit in this remedy is a bar to any money judgments against the fraudulent transferor since awarding the judgment creditor a money judgment would amount to an increase in the judgment debt owed to the judgment creditor by the fraudulent transferor.

         Purpose of section.
        </b>
        From a consideration of the language of the entire section, it is evident that the legislative purpose of this section is to assure that tenants will not be wrongfully deprived of their security deposits, and that if so deprived they will be entitled to adequate judicial relief. Ball v. Weller, 39 Colo. App. 14, 563 P.2d 371 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is designed to assist tenants in vindicating their legal rights and to equalize the disparity in power which exists between landlord and tenant in conflicts over relatively small sums. Martin v. Allen, 193 Colo. 395, 566 P.2d 1075 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides a court remedy against landlords who withhold security deposits willfully and wrongfully, and the tenant’s attorney should be paid for the time necessary to prevail; absent reasonable attorneys’ fees, the security deposit law would not be enforced. Mau v. E.P.H. Corp., 638 P.2d 777 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Security deposit actually belongs to tenant;
        </b>
        it is only security for the landlord. Turner v. Lyon, 189 Colo. 234, 539 P.2d 1241 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Landlords not absolved from notice requirement.
        </b>
        The last sentence in subsection (1) does not absolve landlords from the notice requirement; it merely permits them, upon proper notice, to apply deposits against unpaid rent. Heatherridge Mgt. Co. v. Benson, 192 Colo. 190, 558 P.2d 435 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Justification for requiring tenants to notify landlords
        </b>
        prior to claiming treble damages, attorneys’ fees, and court costs is to give the landlord one last week to return the security deposit. Turner v. Lyon, 189 Colo. 234, 539 P.2d 1241 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         “Willful” defined.
        </b>
        The term “willful” in subsection (3)(a) means “deliberate”. Turner v. Lyon, 189 Colo. 234, 539 P.2d 1241 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         When retention “willful”.
        </b>
        If the landlord deliberately fails to return the security deposit during the additional seven-day period, the retention is logically “willful” under this section. Turner v. Lyon, 189 Colo. 234, 539 P.2d 1241 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Wrongful withholding of deposit determined.
        </b>
        Failure to return the deposit, coupled with failure to provide a tenant with statutorily mandated written statement of reasons for the retention, makes the withholding of a deposit wrongful. Martinez v. Steinbaum, 623 P.2d 49 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Deposit not “wrongfully” held.
        </b>
        Where respondent authorized petitioner in writing to retain that portion of his deposit equal to one month’s rent, petitioner did not withhold that part of the deposit “wrongfully”, within the contemplation of subsection (3)(a). Heatherridge Mgt. Co. v. Benson, 192 Colo. 190, 558 P.2d 435 (1976).

        </b>
        The discrepancy between the amount of a security deposit retained and the amount of actual damages proved by the landlord is important evidence of his good faith. Guzman v. McDonald, 194 Colo. 160, 570 P.2d 532 (1977).

        Where the statutory notice was given within the one-month period allowed by subsection (1), and only nine days after the surrender of the key to the premises, and suit was commenced prior to the expiration of the additional seven-day period contemplated by the notice requirements of subsection (3)(a), award of treble damages is improper.

         A tenant cannot be compelled to arbitrate a claim for violation of the wrongful withholding of security deposits act.

        The act creates a cause of action enforceable in Colorado courts; the enforceability of the statutory cause of action in a legal proceeding cannot be limited or waived by an arbitration agreement. Thus an arbitration provision that would waive this cause of action in favor of mandatory arbitration is unenforceable to the extent that it applies to an action brought under the act. Ingold v.

       <p>
        <b>
         Constitutionality of attorneys’ fees provision.
        </b>
        The legitimate aims of subsection (3)(a) supply a rational basis for the distinction between prevailing tenant-plaintiffs, who are entitled to attorneys’ fees, and prevailing landlord-defendants, who are not, and therefore the provision is constitutional. Torres v. Portillos, 638 P.2d 274 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equality of opportunity to recover attorneys’ fees is not a fundamental right, and therefore the rational relationship test, not the strict scrutiny test, is the appropriate standard for equal protection review. Torres v. Portillos, 638 P.2d 274 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Entitlement to attorneys’ fees.
        </b>
        Tenants who are successful on appeal are entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees. Martin v. Allen, 193 Colo. 395, 566 P.2d 1075 (1977); Kirkland v. Allen, 678 P.2d 568 (Colo. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Attorneys’ fees allowable include
        </b>
        those incurred on appeal. Martinez v. Steinbaum, 623 P.2d 49 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees allowable include those incurred in resolving an issue as to the amount of reasonable attorney fees incurred in the underlying litigation and those incurred on appeal. Mau v. E.P.H. Corp., 638 P.2d 777 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Rationale for award of attorney fees.
        </b>
        The reason this section provides for an award of attorney fees is two-fold: (1) To insulate the award of damages from being substantially reduced by the fees; and (2) to encourage the private bar to enforce its provisions in actions which generally involve small amounts of money. Ball v. Weller, 39 Colo. App. 14, 563 P.2d 371 (1977); Torres v. Portillos, 638 P.2d 274 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>

         Successful tenants are entitled to recover attorney fees for landlord’s independent actions
        </b>
        challenging rulings and fee awards in the underlying security deposit litigation. Mishkin v. Young, 198 P.3d 1269 (Colo. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Hearing to determine amount of attorneys’ fees.
        </b>
        When a successful plaintiff has requested attorneys’ fees in his complaint, such an award is mandatory, and it becomes incumbent upon the trial court to hold a hearing to determine the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees to be awarded. Ball v. Weller, 39 Colo. App. 14, 563 P.2d 371 (1977); Kirkland v. Allen, 678 P.2d 568 (Colo. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Awarding fees without hearing error.
        </b>
        The trial court erred in awarding attorneys’ fees to respondent without a hearing on their reasonableness. Heatherridge Mgt. Co. v. Benson, 192 Colo. 190, 558 P.2d 435 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Factors considered in determining of reasonable fee.
        </b>
        If the fee requested is reasonable in light of community standards and the other criteria to be considered by the court, it is not appropriate for a court to take into consideration what a major client may pay the attorney on an hourly basis or the possible absence of overhead expenses comparable to those borne by lawyers in private practice. Mau v. E.P.H. Corp., 638 P.2d 777 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         When penalty provision attaches.
        </b>
        If a landlord does not return a security deposit within the required time, the penalty provision of subsection (3)(a) attaches to that portion of the money wrongfully retained, plus attorneys’ fees, and court costs. Turner v. Lyon, 189 Colo. 234, 539 P.2d 1241 (1975); Kirkland v. Allen, 678 P.2d 568 (Colo. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where landlord deliberately fails to return security deposit within the additional seven-day period following the tenant’s notice to landlord of his intention to file legal proceedings, such retention is logically “willful” under subsection (3)(a) treble damages provisions. Kirkland v. Allen, 678 P.2d 568 (Colo. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The purpose of the seven-day notice provision in subsection (3)(a)
        </b>
        is to give landlords one last week to avoid treble damages by returning the security deposit. Mishkin v. Young, 107 P.3d 393 (Colo. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A landlord may not avoid treble damages by accounting
        </b>
        for a security deposit during the seven-day period established by subsection (3)(a). The seven-day period is beyond the statutory deadline of subsection (1) and, therefore, the landlord has already forfeited all rights to retain the deposit. Mishkin v. Young, 107 P.3d 393 (Colo. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Statutory liability of subsection (3)(a) may be offset
        </b>
        by an award, if any, made to the landlord by counterclaim for damages caused by the tenant to the property, and the landlord has the burden of proving the claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Turner v. Lyon, 189 Colo. 234, 539 P.2d 1241 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Treble damages action not “frivolous” merely because landlord wins.
        </b>
        A treble damages action under subsection (3)(a) cannot be characterized as “frivolous” or “groundless”, as used in § 13-17-101(3), merely because the landlord prevails on the merits of his defense. Torres v. Portillos, 638 P.2d 274 (Colo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Prospective renter was not entitled to treble damages
        </b>
        pursuant to this section since deposit paid for rental of condominium unit was not a security deposit but was instead prepayment of the entire rent for said unit. Mtn. Queen Condo. Ass’n v. Haan, 753 P.2d 1234 (Colo. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Statute of limitations.
        </b>
        The treble damages provision of this section, being penal in nature, is governed by the one-year statute of limitations; however, the recovery of the actual security deposit and the award of attorneys’ fees, being remedial in nature, are limited by the six-year statute of limitations. Carlson v. McCoy, 193 Colo. 391, 566 P.2d 1073 (1977).

       Return of security deposit - hazardous condition - gas appliance.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t38a12p01s38-12-104ol11">
       Anytime service personnel from any organization providing gas service to a residential building become aware of any hazardous condition of a gas appliance, piping, or other gas equipment, such personnel shall inform the customer of record at the affected address in writing of the hazardous condition and take any further action provided for by the policies of such personnel’s employer. Such written notification shall state the potential nature of the hazard as a fire hazard or a hazard to life, health, property, or public welfare and shall explain the possible cause of the hazard.
      </li>
      <li id="t38a12p01s38-12-104ol12">
       If the resident of the residential building is a tenant, such tenant shall immediately inform the landlord of the property or the landlord’s agent in writing of the existence of the hazard.
      </li>
      <li id="t38a12p01s38-12-104ol13">
       The landlord shall then have seventy-two hours excluding a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday after the actual receipt of the written notice of the hazardous condition to have the hazardous condition repaired by a professional. “Professional” for the purposes of this section means a person authorized by the state of Colorado or by a county or municipal government through license or certificate where such government authorization is required. Where no person with such government authorization is available, and where there are no local requirements for government authorization, a person who is otherwise qualified and who possesses insurance with a minimum of one hundred thousand dollars public liability and property damage coverage shall be deemed a professional for purposes of this section. Proof of such repairs shall be forwarded to the landlord or the landlord’s agent. Such proof may also be used as an affirmative defense in any action to recover the security deposit, as provided for in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t38a12p01s38-12-104ol14">
       If the landlord does not have the repairs made within seventy-two hours excluding a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, and the condition of the building remains hazardous, the tenant may opt to vacate the premises. After the tenant vacates the premises, the lease or other rental agreement between the landlord and tenant becomes null and void, all rights and future obligations between the landlord and tenant pursuant to the lease or other rental agreement terminate, and the tenant may demand the immediate return of all or any portion of the security deposit held by the landlord to which the tenant is entitled. The landlord shall have seventy-two hours following the tenant’s vacation of the premises to deliver to the tenant all of, or the appropriate portion of, the security deposit plus any rent rebate owed to the tenant for rent paid by the tenant for the period of time after the tenant has vacated. If the seventy-second hour falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the security deposit must be delivered by noon on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The tenant shall provide the landlord with a correct forwarding address. No security deposit shall be retained to cover normal wear and tear. In the event that actual cause exists for retaining any portion of the security deposit, the landlord shall provide the tenant with a written statement listing the exact reasons for the retention of any portion of the security deposit. When the statement is delivered, it shall be accompanied by payment of the difference between any sum deposited and the amount retained. The landlord is deemed to have complied with this section by mailing said statement and any payments required by this section to the forwarding address of the tenant. Nothing in this section shall preclude the landlord from withholding the security deposit for nonpayment of rent or for nonpayment of utility charges, repair work, or cleaning contracted for by the tenant. If the tenant does not receive the entire security deposit or a portion of the security deposit together with a written statement listing the exact reasons for the retention of any portion of the security deposit within the time period provided for in this section, the retention of the security deposit shall be deemed willful and wrongful and, notwithstanding the provisions of section 38-12-103 (3), shall entitle the tenant to twice the amount of the security deposit and to reasonable attorney fees.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that mobile homes, manufactured housing, and factory-built housing are important and effective ways to meet Colorado’s affordable housing needs. The general assembly further finds and declares that, because of the unique aspects of mobile homes and mobile home park ownership, there is a need to protect mobile home owners from eviction with short notice so as to prevent mobile home owners from losing their shelter as well as any equity in their mobile homes. The general assembly encourages local governments to allow and protect mobile home parks in their jurisdictions and to enact plans to increase the number of mobile home parks in their jurisdictions. The general assembly further encourages local governments to provide incentives to mobile home park owners to attract additional mobile home parks and to increase the viability of current parks.

         IMPORTANT NOTICE TO THE HOME OWNER:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        This notice and the accompanying notice to quit/notice of nonpayment of rent are the first steps in the eviction process. Any dispute you may have regarding the grounds for eviction should be addressed with your landlord or the management of the mobile home park or in the courts if an eviction action is filed. Please be advised that the “Mobile Home Park Act”, part 2 of article 12 of title 38, Colorado Revised Statutes, and the “Mobile Home Park Act Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Program” created in section 38-12-1104, Colorado Revised Statutes, may provide you with legal protection.
       </p>
       <p>
        NOTICE TO QUIT: In order to terminate a home owner’s tenancy, the landlord or management of a mobile home park must serve to a home owner a notice to quit. The notice must be in writing and must contain certain information, including:
       </p>
       <p>
        • The grounds for the termination of the tenancy;
       </p>
       <p>
        • Whether or not the home owner has a right to cure under the “Mobile Home Park Act”; and
       </p>
       <p>
        • That the home owner has the option of mediation pursuant to section 38-12-216, Colorado Revised Statutes, of the “Mobile Home Park Act” and the option of filing a complaint through the “Mobile Home Park Act Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Program” created in section 38-12-1104, Colorado Revised Statutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        NOTICE OF NONPAYMENT OF RENT: In order to terminate a home owner’s tenancy due to nonpayment of rent, the landlord or management of a mobile home park must serve to a home owner a notice of nonpayment of rent. The notice must be in writing and must require that the home owner either make payment of rent or sell the owner’s unit or remove it from the premises within a period of not less than ten days after the date the notice is served or posted, for failure to pay rent when due.
       </p>
       <p>
        CURE PERIODS: If the home owner has a right to cure under the “Mobile Home Park Act”, the landlord or management of a mobile home park cannot terminate a home owner’s tenancy without first providing the home owner with a time period to cure the noncompliance. “Cure” refers to a home owner remedying, fixing, or otherwise correcting the situation or problem that made the tenancy subject to termination pursuant to sections 38-12-202, 38-12-203, or 38-12-204, Colorado Revised Statutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        COMMENCEMENT OF LEGAL ACTION TO TERMINATE THE TENANCY: After the last day of the applicable notice period required by section 38-12-202 (1)(c), Colorado Revised Statutes, a legal action may be commenced to take possession of the space leased by the home owner. In order to evict a home owner, the landlord or management of the mobile home park must prove:
       </p>
       <p>
        • The landlord or management complied with the notice requirements of the “Mobile Home Park Act”;
       </p>
       <p>
        • The landlord or management provided the home owner with a statement of reasons for termination of the tenancy; and
       </p>
       <p>
        • The reasons for termination of the tenancy are true and valid under the “Mobile Home Park Act”.
       </p>
       <p>
        To defend against an eviction action, a home owner must appear in court. If the court rules in favor of the landlord or management of the mobile home park, the home owner has not less than thirty days from the time of the ruling to either remove or sell the mobile home and to vacate the premises. If the home owner wishes to extend such period beyond thirty days but not more than sixty days from the date of the ruling, the home owner shall prepay to the landlord an amount equal to a pro rata share of rent for each day following the expiration of the initial thirty-day period after the court’s ruling that the mobile home owner will remain on the premises. All prepayments shall be paid no later than thirty days after the court ruling. This section does not preclude earlier removal by law enforcement officers of a mobile home or one or more mobile home owners or occupants from the mobile home park if a mobile home owner violates article 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, or 18 of title 18 or section 16-13-303, Colorado Revised Statutes.

         Upon granting judgment for possession by the landlord in a forcible entry and detainer action, the court shall immediately issue a writ of restitution which the landlord shall take to the sheriff. In addition, if a money judgment has been requested in the complaint and if service was accomplished by personal service, the court shall determine and enter judgment for any amounts due to the landlord and shall calculate a pro rata daily rent amount that must be paid for the home to remain in the park. The court may rely upon information provided by the landlord or the landlord’s attorney when determining the pro rata daily rent amount to be paid by the home owner.

The notice of judgment must also advise the home owner, in instances where the mobile home must be removed from the mobile home lot, to prepare the mobile home for removal from the premises by removing the skirting, disconnecting utilities, attaching tires, and otherwise making the mobile home safe and ready for highway travel.

         Should the home owner fail to have the mobile home safe and ready for physical removal from the premises or should inclement weather or other unforeseen problems occur at the time specified in the notice of judgment, the landlord and the sheriff may, by written agreement, extend the time for the execution of the writ of restitution to allow time for the landlord to arrange to have the necessary work done or to permit the sheriff’s execution of the writ of restitution at a time when weather or other conditions will make removal less hazardous to the mobile home.

The liability of the landlord and the sheriff in such event shall be limited to gross negligence or willful and wanton disregard of the property rights of the home owner. The responsibility to prevent freezing and to prevent wind and weather damage to the mobile home lies exclusively with those persons who have a property interest in the mobile home; except that the landlord may take appropriate action to prevent freezing, to prevent wind and weather damage, and to prevent damage caused by vandals.

        Ordinance constituted rent control because options it imposes for constructing new employee housing or deed restricting housing are within commonly understood meaning of rent control.
       </b>
       Rent control falls within an area of mixed state and local concern. Ordinance clearly conflicts with state prohibition on rent control contained in this section. Accordingly, ordinance invalid and section does not violate home rule amendment to constitution. Town of Telluride v. Lot Thirty-Four Venture, 3 P.3d 30 (Colo. 2000).

       It is unlawful for a landlord to remove or exclude a tenant from a dwelling unit without resorting to court process, unless the removal or exclusion is consistent with article 18.5 of title 25 and the rules promulgated by the state board of health for the cleanup of an illegal drug laboratory; is with the mutual consent of the landlord and tenant; or unless the dwelling unit has been abandoned by the tenant, as evidenced by the return of keys, the substantial removal of the tenant’s personal property, notice by the tenant, or the extended absence of the tenant while rent remains unpaid, any of which would cause a reasonable person to believe the tenant had permanently surrendered possession of the dwelling unit. Unlawful removal or exclusion includes the willful termination of utilities or the willful removal of doors, windows, or locks to the premises other than as required for repair or maintenance. If the landlord willfully and unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or willfully and unlawfully causes the termination of heat, running water, hot water, electric, gas, or other essential services, the tenant may seek any remedy available under the law, including this part 5.

       A tenant affected by any violation of this section may bring a civil action to restrain further violations and to recover damages, costs, and reasonable attorney fees. In the case of a violation, the tenant must be awarded statutory damages equal to the tenant’s actual damages and the higher amount of either three times the monthly rent or five thousand dollars, as well as any other damages, attorney fees, and costs that may be owed.

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t38a12p11s38-12-1102ol11a">
         There are factors unique to the relationship between mobile home owners and mobile home park landlords;
        </li>
        <li id="t38a12p11s38-12-1102ol11b">
         Once occupancy has commenced, a mobile home owner may be subject to violations of the “Mobile Home Park Act”, part 2 of this article 12, without an adequate remedy at law because the difficulty and expense in moving and relocating a mobile home can affect the operation of market forces and lead to an inequality of the bargaining position of the parties;
        </li>
        <li id="t38a12p11s38-12-1102ol11c">
         Taking legal action against a mobile home park landlord for violations of the “Mobile Home Park Act” can be a costly and lengthy process, and many mobile home owners cannot afford to pursue a court process to vindicate statutory rights. Mobile home park landlords will also benefit by having access to a process that resolves disputes quickly and efficiently.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t38a12p11s38-12-1102ol12">
       Therefore, it is the intent of the general assembly to provide an equitable as well as a less costly and more efficient way for mobile home owners and mobile home park landlords to resolve disputes, and to provide a mechanism for state authorities to quickly locate mobile home park landlords.

     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the growth and maintenance of museum collections, both public and private, is a matter of general public interest to the citizens of Colorado. Because museums of all kinds depend upon loans of various articles of property to augment their collections and because uncertainty regarding title to and responsibility for loaned property is a hindrance to museums in their efforts to maintain, repair, and dispose of property in their possession, it is the purpose of this article to fairly and reasonably allocate responsibilities and to provide rules for the determination of title and financial responsibilities in certain cases.

           In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a customer shall have all rights and title to any mold in the possession of a molder that was used to perform work for such customer; except that, if a customer has not claimed possession of a mold within three years following its last prior use, such mold shall be presumed to be abandoned by the customer and all rights and title to such mold shall be transferred to the molder who shall destroy or otherwise dispose of such mold as abandoned property in accordance with this section. For purposes of this subsection (3), “within three years following its last prior use” means any period following the last prior use of the mold and includes periods preceding September 30, 1998.

          <li id="t38a20p01s38-20-116ol13aII">
           Any molder who desires to have all rights and title to a mold shall send written notice to the customer’s last-known address by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, signed by the addressee only. If the written notice is returned unclaimed, the molder shall publish said notice at least one day in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the mold is located. Such written notice shall clearly indicate that the molder intends to terminate the customer’s rights and title to the mold described in such notice and shall include a recitation of the customer’s rights, as set forth in this section.
          </li>
          <li id="t38a20p01s38-20-116ol13aIII">
           If a customer does not respond to the written notice sent pursuant to subparagraph (II) of this paragraph (a) within one hundred twenty days after the date of such notice to claim possession of the mold or does not make other contractual arrangements with the molder for storage of such mold, all rights and title of the customer to such mold shall transfer to the molder. Such molder may then destroy or otherwise dispose of the mold without risk of liability to the customer.

          <li id="t38a20p01s38-20-116ol13aIV">
           The molder shall maintain in such molder’s records for a period of one year a copy of the notice sent pursuant to subparagraph (II) of this paragraph (a), together with the return receipt signed by the addressee, or, if said notice is returned unclaimed, said notice and the proof of return unclaimed shall be so maintained.

        <li id="t38a20p01s38-20-116ol13b">
         Nothing in this subsection (3) shall require a molder to commence a judicial action to foreclose on a molders’ lien if such mold is abandoned, as such term is defined in this section, and nothing in this subsection (3) shall be interpreted to eliminate any right of action a molder may have against a customer for unpaid charges, damages, costs, or attorney fees, if provided for by contract.

The reasonable cost of keeping the livestock up to the date of the sale shall not exceed five dollars per head per day.

If the owner and the owner’s agent are not known and there are sale proceeds to be forwarded, such proceeds shall be returned to the board. The board shall deposit such proceeds in its estray fund and make a record of such deposit, identifying the livestock and stating the amount realized from the sale. The board shall pay proceeds from the estray fund to any secured party that has filed a lien against the livestock sold and has submitted a claim for payment to the board. Such payments shall be made only to the extent of the amount owed to the secured party. Such record shall be open to public inspection.

The court, in its discretion, may order that the livestock be sold and that the sale proceeds be deposited with the clerk of the court pending further order of such court.

         Upon receiving an application pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (2), a court may, upon good cause shown, require the lienor to post bond for such amount as the defendant may be entitled for damages sustained in the event of wrongful foreclosure. Such bond shall be secured by two or more sureties, one corporate surety authorized to do business in this state, or a cash bond, whichever is approved by the court.

       When the livestock cannot be sold in one day, the sale may be continued on a day-to-day basis. Upon completion of the sale, the public livestock market shall file a bill of sale with the court that entered judgment of foreclosure. Such bill of sale shall include the amount for which each animal was sold and the name of each purchaser. The court shall record such bill of sale in its docket and shall preserve the original.

      Where a rental agreement is entered into between the owner and the occupant, the owner and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns have a lien upon all personal property located at the self-service storage facility for rent, labor, or other charges, present or future, including late fees as specified in section 38-21.5-101.5 (3), in relation to the personal property and for expenses necessary for its preservation or expenses reasonably incurred in its sale or other disposition pursuant to this article 21.5. The lien attaches as of the date the personal property is brought to the self-service storage facility and continues so long as the owner retains possession and until the default is corrected, a sale is conducted, or the property is otherwise disposed of to satisfy the lien. Before taking enforcement action pursuant to section 38-21.5-103 (1)(b), the owner shall determine if a financing statement concerning the property to be sold or otherwise disposed of has been filed with the secretary of state in accordance with part 5 of article 9 of title 4.

This lien claim when so filed may be enforced under the provisions of this article in the same manner as if said laborers or materials had been furnished and labor performed for each of said buildings, structures, or other improvements separately; but if the cost or value of such labor, laborers, or materials cannot be readily and definitely divided and apportioned among the several buildings, structures, or other improvements, then one lien claim may be made, established, and enforced against all such buildings, structures, or other improvements, together with the ground upon which the same may be situated, and in such case for the purposes of this article, all such buildings, structures, and improvements shall be deemed one building, structure, or improvement, and the land on which the same are situated as one tract of land.

A transcript of the docket of said judgment and decree may be filed with the county clerk and recorder of the county where such property is situated or in any other county, and thereupon said judgment and decree shall become a lien upon the real property in such county of each party so personally liable in favor of any such lien claimant holding any such judgment against any such party so personally liable, as in other cases of recording transcripts of judgment.

       Assignment of lien - failure to support lien.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any party claiming a lien may assign in writing his claim and lien to any other claimant or other person who shall thereupon have all the rights and remedies of the assignor for the purpose of filing and for the enforcement of any such lien by action under this article, and the assignment shall be a sufficient consideration as to all other parties for the purpose of such action. Such assignment may be made before or after the filing of the statement of lien. Any such claimant, whether as assignee or otherwise, may include all the liens he may possess against the same property in any such statement, and when more than one such claim is included in one such statement, one verification thereto shall be sufficient. Any person may file separate statements of two or more claims. If, on the trial of a cause under the provisions of this article, the proceedings will not support a lien, the plaintiff and all lien claimants entitled thereto may proceed to judgment as in an action on contract, and executions may issue as provided in such cases, and said judgment shall have all the rights of a judgment in a personal action.

     <p>
      Whenever any person removes any property subject to a lien under this article out of the county in which the statement has been filed, the lien claimant may file, within thirty days after receiving notice of such removal, with the county clerk and recorder of the county to which such property has been removed, an inventory of said property so removed, showing the amount due and unpaid thereon, which inventory shall be filed in the lien records of such county. Such filing shall operate as a notice of the existence of the lien, and it shall thereupon attach to and extend to the leasehold and other premises, properties, and appurtenances with which said property so removed has been put in use or to which it has attached if it is of the kind and character enumerated in section 38-24-101. If said leasehold, premises, properties, and appurtenances belong to some party other than the party originally contracting with the lien claimant, the lien shall be limited to the property and chattels so removed. The benefits of this section as regards removal shall apply even though such removal is to another locality in the same county.

      Within sixty days after the date of delivery of transportation fuel or an earlier agreed-upon payment date, every distributor has a lien upon the property of a retailer or other commercial user for the amount of unreimbursed taxes paid by the distributor under article 27 of title 39, C.R.S., for each delivery of transportation fuel to that retailer or other commercial user. The lien extends to all business assets and property of the retailer or other commercial user, including stock in trade, business fixtures, and equipment owned or used by the retailer or other commercial user in the conduct of business, as long as a delinquency in the reimbursement continues.

If the contractor or subcontractor, if he is the debtor, does not give, within ten days after the receipt of such amount, the same railroad, reservoir, or irrigating canal company, or its agent, written notice that the claim is disputed, he shall be considered as assenting to its payment and the railroad, reservoir, or irrigating canal company, or its agent, shall be justified in paying the same when due and charging the same to the contractor. The person to whom any such debt is due and who delivers a verified account thereof as provided may recover the amount thereof in an action at law to the extent of any balance due by the railroad, reservoir, or irrigating canal company to the contractor at or after the time of delivering the verified account. Nothing in this section or in section 38-26-103 shall interfere with the right of action upon bonds provided for in section 38-26-102 or against the railroad, reservoir, or irrigating canal company for the full amount of any such debt in case of a failure of the company to take a bond.

       Right of purchaser to obtain partial specific performance.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If it is impossible for a vendor of real property to convey a portion of the real property he contracted to convey, the vendee has a right to obtain a conveyance of that portion which it is possible to convey and a right to obtain damages or other equitable relief concerning the portion which it is impossible to convey. For the purposes of this section, “vendor” includes an optionor or a grantor of a right to repurchase or lease, and “vendee” includes an optionee or a holder of a right to repurchase or lease.

      The general assembly finds and declares that it is in the public interest to define conservation easements in gross, since such easements have not been defined by the judiciary. Further, the general assembly finds and declares that it is in the public interest to determine who may receive such easements and for what purpose such easements may be received.

     <p>
      If it is determined that conditions on or surrounding a property encumbered by a conservation easement in gross change so that it becomes impossible to fulfill its conservation purposes that are defined in the deed of conservation easement, a court with jurisdiction may, at the joint request of both the owner of property encumbered by a conservation easement and the holder of the easement, terminate, release, extinguish, or abandon the conservation easement. If condemnation by a public authority of a part of a property or of the entire property encumbered by a conservation easement in gross renders it impossible to fulfill any of the conservation purposes outlined in the deed of conservation easement, the conservation easement may be terminated, released, extinguished, or abandoned through condemnation proceedings. A conservation easement in gross for which a Colorado state income tax credit has been allowed may not in whole or in part be released, terminated, extinguished, or abandoned by merger with the underlying fee interest in the servient land or water rights. Any release, termination, or extinguishment of a conservation easement under this section must be recorded in the records of the office of the clerk and recorder in the county where the conservation easement is located.

        <li id="t38a31p01s38-31-101ol16c">
         Upon the death of a joint tenant, the deceased joint tenant’s interest is terminated. In the case of one surviving joint tenant, his or her interest in the property shall continue free of the deceased joint tenant’s interest. In the case of two or more surviving joint tenants, their interests shall continue in proportion to their respective interests at the time the joint tenancy was created.

         For purposes of the “Colorado Medical Assistance Act”, articles 4, 5, and 6 of title 25.5, C.R.S., a joint tenancy shall be deemed to be a joint tenancy with equal interests among the joint tenants regardless of the language in the deed or other instrument creating the joint tenancy.

       <b>
        Joint tenancy and tenancy in common distinguished.
       </b>
       The major distinguishing characteristic of joint tenancy, as opposed to tenancy in common, is right of survivorship in each of the cotenants. Bradley v. Mann, 34 Colo. App. 135, 525 P.2d 492 (1974), aff’d, 188 Colo. 392, 535 P.2d 213 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court must presume the tenancies are not joint till something is shown otherwise. Miller v. Buyer, 82 Colo. 474, 261 P. 659 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section raises a presumption against the creation of joint tenancies, so that if the parties to a partnership had intended a joint tenancy to apply only to one-half of the partnership property, or to a particular one-half interest in it, they could and--because of this section--should have specifically so stated. In re Sullivan’s Estate, 121 Colo. 494, 218 P.2d 1064 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of an affirmative declaration that the estate devised is in joint tenancy, an estate in tenancy in common will be devised, unless it clearly and explicitly appears from the language employed that the testator understood the nature and incidents of the different estates and intended to create a joint tenancy. Estate of Kwatkowski, 94 Colo. 222, 29 P.2d 639 (1934); Chilson v. Reed, 154 Colo. 149, 389 P.2d 87 (1964).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Language creates joint tenancy.
       </b>
       The statement in a corporate stock certificate that parties “as joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common” are the owners of the stock, amply proclaims a joint tenancy, and upon its face the certificate must be considered as accomplishing that result. Eisenhardt v. Lowell, 105 Colo. 417, 98 P.2d 1001 (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rights vest at creation of joint tenancy.
       </b>
       In real property, rights under a joint tenancy are fixed and vested in the joint tenants at the time of the creation of the joint tenancy; and once a joint tenancy is created, the donor no longer has the power to exercise absolute dominion over the property. He may not treat the whole property as his own, he cannot convey to a third party the interest he created in the joint tenant, and while he may occupy the whole property, he cannot exclude the other joint tenants from their right to use and enjoy the property, and he is liable to them for any depleting use he may make of the land. Estate of Lee v. Graber, 170 Colo. 419, 462 P.2d 492 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Grantees under a joint tenancy deed are presumed to own equal shares
       </b>
       in the property conveyed, but parol evidence is admissible to overcome the presumption. Duston v. Duston, 31 Colo. App. 147, 498 P.2d 1174 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Action by joint tenants inconsistent with survivorship right destroys tenancy.
       </b>
       In ascertaining whether a joint tenancy has been destroyed, resulting in a tenancy in common, this state has recently adopted the modern test which focuses on the intent of the parties with regard to the right of survivorship characteristic. Actions by the joint tenants which are inconsistent with the right of survivorship operate to terminate the joint tenancy. Mangus v. Miller, 35 Colo. App. 115, 532 P.2d 368 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Action against joint tenancy.
       </b>
       Where several parties are defendants in a suit to quiet title, in order that they may be sued jointly, it must affirmatively appear that they are joint tenants in whatever interest they claim to have. Miller v. Buyer, 82 Colo. 474, 261 P. 659 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Gift of joint interest is irrevocable.
       </b>
       A gift of a joint interest in real property is complete, perfect, and irrevocable. Estate of Lee v. Graber, 170 Colo. 419, 462 P.2d 492 (1969).

        A joint tenant may sever a joint tenancy by conveying the property to himself or herself as a tenant in common

        Debtor’s joint tenancy interest in property terminated upon his death.

       Condominium ownership recognized.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Condominium ownership of real property is recognized in this state. Whether created before or after April 30, 1963, such ownership shall be deemed to consist of a separate estate in an individual air space unit of a multi-unit property together with an undivided interest in common elements. The separate estate of any condominium owner of an individual air space unit and his common ownership of such common elements as are appurtenant to his individual air space unit by the terms of the recorded declaration are inseparable for any period of condominium ownership that is prescribed by the recorded declaration. Condominium ownership may exist on land owned in fee simple or held under an estate for years.

       Assessment of condominium ownership.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever condominium ownership of real property is created or separate assessment of condominium units is desired, a written notice thereof shall be delivered to the assessor of the county in which said real property is situated, which notice shall set forth descriptions of the condominium units. Thereafter all taxes, assessments, and other charges of this state or of any political subdivision, or of any special improvement district, or of any other taxing or assessing authority shall be assessed against and collected on each condominium unit, each of which shall be carried on the tax books as a separate and distinct parcel for that purpose and not on the building or property as a whole. The valuation of the general and limited common elements shall be assessed proportionately upon the individual air space unit in the manner provided in the declaration. The lien for taxes assessed to any individual condominium owner shall be confined to his condominium unit and to his undivided interest in the general and limited common elements. No forfeiture or sale of any condominium unit for delinquent taxes, assessments, or charges shall divest or in any way affect the title of other condominium units.

       The declaration shall be recorded in the county where the condominium property is located. Such declaration shall provide for the filing for record of a map properly locating condominium units. Any instrument affecting the condominium unit may legally describe it by the identifying condominium unit number or symbol as shown on such map. If such declaration provides for the disposition of condominium units in the event of the destruction or obsolescence of buildings in which such units are situate and restricts partition of the common elements, the rules or laws known as the rule against perpetuities and the rule prohibiting unlawful restraints on alienation shall not be applied to defeat or limit any such provisions.

       To the extent that any such declaration contains a mandatory requirement that all condominium unit owners be members of an association or corporation or provides for the payment of charges assessed by the association upon condominium units or the appointment of an attorney-in-fact to deal with the property upon its destruction or obsolescence, any rule of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the same shall be considered as covenants running with the land binding upon all condominium owners and their successors in interest. Any common law rule terminating agency upon death or disability of a principal shall not be applied to defeat or limit any such provisions.

       Said notice constitutes the notice to terminate the tenancy as provided by section 13-40-107, C.R.S.; except that no residential tenancy shall be terminated prior to the expiration date of the existing lease agreement, if any, unless consented to by both the tenant and the developer. If the term of the lease has less than ninety days remaining when notification is mailed or delivered, as the case may be, or if there is no written lease agreement, residential tenancy may not be terminated by the developer less than ninety days after the date the notice is mailed or delivered, as the case may be, to the tenant, unless consented to by both the tenant and the developer. The return receipt shall be prima facie evidence of receipt of notice. If the term of the lease has less than ninety days remaining when notification is mailed or delivered, as the case may be, the tenant may hold over for the remainder of said ninety-day period under the same terms and conditions of the lease agreement if the tenant makes timely rental payments and performs other conditions of the lease agreement.

       Any person who applies for a residential tenancy after the recording of the declaration shall be informed of this recording at the time of application, and any leases executed after such recording may provide for termination within less than ninety days provided that the terms of the lease conspicuously disclose the intention to convert the property containing the leased premises to condominium ownership.

      Editor’s note:
     </b>
     The provisions of this act are based substantially on the “Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act”, as promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Colorado did not adopt article 4 concerning protection of purchasers and the optional article 5 of said uniform act concerning administration and registration of common interest communities.

        Subdivision can be a common interest community as defined in subsection (8) even if it does not include common property.
       </b>
       Where subdivision covenants required homeowners to pay mandatory assessments for maintenance or improvement and the homeowners’ association was responsible for maintenance and improvement of the subdivision and enforcement of covenants, the absence of common property in the subdivision did not preclude the subdivision from being a common interest community because the scope of the phrase “other real estate” in subsection (8) is not restricted to common property. Hiwan Homeowners Ass’n v. Knotts, 215 P.3d 1271 (Colo. App. 2009).
      </p>

       <b>
        Based upon definition of “declaration” under subsection (13), in the absence of covenant imposing mandatory dues, homeowners association has the implied power to collect assessments from homeowners to pay for the maintenance of the common areas of the subdivision.
       </b>
       Here, the “declarations” for the homeowners association of the subdivision in effect at the time respondent lot owner purchased his lot incorporated all documents recorded up to that date. At the time respondent lot owner purchased his lot, the declarations made clear that the homeowners association had the power to impose annual membership or use fees on lot owners. These declarations were sufficient to create a common interest community by implication, with the concomitant power to impose mandatory dues on lot owners to pay for the maintenance of common areas of the subdivision. The respondent lot owner, therefore, has an implied duty to pay his proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the common area. Evergreen Highlands Ass’n v. West, 73 P.3d 1 (Colo. 2003).

       Recorded plat, deeds, and subdivision agreement, taken together, do not create a common interest community when the documents do not obligate homeowners to pay expenses related to community-owned space, do not expressly create a homeowners’ association, and lack too many statutorily prescribed components.

       Any lease, the expiration or termination of which may terminate the common interest community or reduce its size, must be recorded. In a leasehold condominium or leasehold planned community, the declaration must contain the signature of each lessor of any such lease in order for the provisions of this section to be effective. The declaration must state:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t38a33.3p02s38-33.3-206ol11a">

      <li id="t38a33.3p02s38-33.3-206ol12">
       After the declaration for a leasehold condominium or leasehold planned community is recorded, neither the lessor nor the lessor’s successor in interest may terminate the leasehold interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of a unit owner’s share of the rent and otherwise complies with all covenants which, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate the lease. A unit owner’s leasehold interest in a condominium or planned community is not affected by failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill any other covenant.

Reallocations shall be confirmed by an amendment to the declaration prepared, executed, and recorded by the association.

       Subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) impose parallel restrictions on the right of withdrawal
       
       depending on whether a declaration divides the real estate into separate portions subject to that right. Subsection (4)(a) applies only if the declaration does not describe separate portions. Subsection (4)(b) thus applies if the declaration does describe separate portions that are subject to withdrawal. “Portion”, as used in subsection (4)(b), must therefore refer to a described portion as used in subsection (4)(a).

      A declarant may maintain sales offices, management offices, and models in the common interest community only if the declaration so provides. Except as provided in a declaration, any real estate in a common interest community used as a sales office, management office, or model and not designated a unit by the declaration is a common element.

Subject to any limitations in the declaration, a declarant may maintain signs on the common elements advertising the common interest community.

       Changes in the allocated interests of a unit, for example, “the undivided interests in and to the general common elements appurtenant to each unit”, are among those for which subsection (4)(a) allows the declaration to require greater than a sixty-seven percent vote. Therefore, the declaration’s requirement for unanimous consent applies to this provision despite the adoption of amendments to other provisions by a two-thirds vote. DA Mtn. Rentals v. Lodge at Lionshead,

       The phrase in subsection (4)(a), “or any larger percentage the declaration specifies”,
       
       recognizes the continued validity of any pre-Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act declaration requirement for a voting threshold in excess of sixty-seven percent in order to change the allocated interest of a unit. Such alterations of property interests are much more consequential than the goals of efficiency and flexibility that are deemed sufficiently protected by the sixty-seven percent threshold referenced in subsection (1)(a)(I).

       Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain, or in the case of foreclosure against an entire cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the declaration, a common interest community may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least sixty-seven percent of the votes in the association are allocated or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the common interest community are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

       An agreement of unit owners to terminate must be evidenced by their execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is situated and is effective only upon recordation.

       In the case of a condominium or planned community containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all of the common elements and units of the common interest community must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the common interest community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the minimum terms of the sale.

       In the case of a condominium or planned community containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all the unit owners consent to the sale.

       Subject to the provisions of a termination agreement described in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in a common interest community following termination, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. If any real estate is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all the powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all the powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections (8), (9), and (10) of this section, taking into account the value of property owned or distributed that is not sold so as to preserve the proportionate interests of each unit owner with respect to all property cumulatively. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the unit owner’s successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the unit owner’s successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this article or the declaration.

     <p>
      A unit owners’ association shall be organized no later than the date the first unit in the common interest community is conveyed to a purchaser. The membership of the association at all times shall consist exclusively of all unit owners or, following termination of the common interest community, of all former unit owners entitled to distributions of proceeds under section 38-33.3-218, or their heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns. The association shall be organized as a nonprofit, not-for-profit, or for-profit corporation or as a limited liability company in accordance with the laws of the state of Colorado; except that the failure of the association to incorporate or organize as a limited liability company will not adversely affect either the existence of the common interest community for purposes of this article or the rights of persons acting in reliance upon such existence, other than as specifically provided in section 38-33.3-316. Neither the choice of entity nor the organizational structure of the association shall be deemed to affect its substantive rights and obligations under this article.

       An association may be formed by a unit owner if declarant fails to do so.
       
       Where the intent of the developer is clear and, especially where the declaration states that the covenants are to run with the land, the right to form the association also runs with the land. Moreover, owners are on notice that an owners’ association, of which they are automatically members, can be formed, even after a delay, by another homeowner. DeJean v. Grosz,

       A declaration does not violate subsection (5) by requiring, even after the period in which a declarant’s control of the association has expired, that the binding arbitration provision may only be amended with the declarant’s consent.
       
       The permissible period of declarant control of an association set forth in subsection (5) is not pertinent to the issue of amending the declaration because the declaration is amended by a vote of the unit owners, not the association. Vallagio at Inverness v. Metro. Homes,

The notice shall also include the following disclosures:
            1. The alleged construction defects might result in increased costs to the association in maintenance or repair or cause an increase in assessments or special assessments to cover the cost of repairs.
            2. If the association does not file a claim before the applicable legal deadlines, the claim will expire.
            3. Until the alleged defects are repaired, sellers of units within the common interest community might owe unit buyers a duty to disclose known defects.
            4. The executive board (intends to enter) (has entered) into a fee arrangement with the attorneys representing the association, under which (the attorneys will be paid a contingency fee equal to ______ percent of the (net) (gross) recovery of the amount the association recovers from the defendant(s)) (the association’s attorneys will be paid (an hourly fee of $_____) (a fixed fee of $_____)).
            5. In addition to attorney fees, the association may incur up to $_______ for legal costs, including expert witnesses, depositions, and filing fees. The amount will not be exceeded without the executive board’s further written authority. If the association does not prevail on its claim, the association may be responsible for paying these legal expenses.
            6. If the association does not prevail on its claim, the association may be responsible for paying its attorney fees.
            7. If the association does not prevail on its claim, a court or arbitrator sometimes awards costs and attorney fees to the opposing party. Should that happen in this case, the association may be responsible for paying the opposing party’s costs and fees as a result of such award.
            8. There is no guarantee that the association will recover enough funds to repair the claimed construction defect(s). If the claimed defects are not repaired, additional damage to property and a reduction in the useful life of the common elements might occur.
            9. Until the claimed construction defects are repaired, or until the construction defect claim is concluded, the market value of the units in the association might be adversely affected.
            10. Until the claimed construction defect(s) are repaired, or until the construction defect(s) claim is concluded, owners in the association might have difficulty refinancing and prospective buyers might have difficulty obtaining financing. In addition, certain federal underwriting standards or regulations prevent refinancing or obtaining a new loan in projects where a construction defect is claimed, and certain lenders as a matter of policy will not refinance or provide a new loan in projects where a construction defect is claimed.

       in its recorded lien statement, the misnomer does not affect its right to foreclose, because this section does not require an association to record a statement to perfect the statutory lien. In the absence of evidence that the misnomer frustrated the identification of the association or caused confusion to the defendants, the association is entitled to foreclose the lien.

       The association has a super-priority lien over the lender’s otherwise senior deed of trust in the event of a foreclosure commenced by the association or the lender, which lien is limited to delinquent assessments accruing within six months of the initiation of foreclosure proceedings. Further, the association’s super-priority lien includes interest, charges, late charges, fines, and attorney fees so long as the total does not exceed the limit. BA Mortg. v. Quail Creek Condo.

      Upon the death of a sole trustee or the surviving trustee of an express trust created by any written instrument affecting title to real property, the trust shall not descend to the heirs of such trustee nor pass to his personal representative, but the trust if then unexecuted shall vest in the then public trustee and his successors in office of the county wherein the real estate is situate, with all powers of the original trustee. The district court may, upon application of any party in interest, appoint a new trustee except in such cases where by law or by the instrument a successor in trust is provided, and in such cases the trust shall vest in such successor.

         Notice of lis pendens was groundless and invalid under subsection (3)

        because the plaintiffs’ original complaint sought only monetary damages and did not affect title to real property. The validity of a notice of lis pendens is determined when it is recorded, and the subsequent filing of an amended complaint that asserts an equitable lien claim cannot relate back to the date of the original complaint and thereby render an invalid notice of lis pendens valid.

         Trial court wrongly held that property owner claiming private prescriptive easement violated subsection (3) by filing sworn affidavits describing prior purchasers’ historic use of the tract at issue on the grounds affidavits unjustifiably clouded title of adverse property claimants.
        </b>
        The affidavits unjustifiably clouded title because property owner failed to obtain a court decree expressly establishing an easement prior to filing them. However, a party may lawfully record a document putting others on notice of a prescriptive easement over another’s property regardless of whether a court has yet recognized the existence of the easement. Brown v. Faatz, 197 P.3d 245 (Colo. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Affidavits describing prior purchasers’ historic use of the tract at issue are instruments encumbering or affecting title to real property within the meaning of subsections (1) and (3).
        </b>
        Nonetheless, recording of the affidavits by property owner claiming easement, which clouded title of other property claimants, did not in and of itself constitute a violation of subsection (3). The statute only prohibits the recording of documents that the person knows or has reason to know are forged, groundless, contain a material misstatement or false claim, or are otherwise invalid. Here, the easement claimant did not know or have reason to know that the affidavits contained material misstatements, and the trial court’s findings that claimant should have known the affidavits were “groundless” or “otherwise invalid” were based on misapprehensions of the law. Accordingly, property owner claiming easement did not violate subsection (3). Brown v. Faatz, 197 P.3d 245 (Colo. App. 2008).

         Trial court did not err by determining that lis pendens filed by condominium purchasers was not spurious at the time it was filed.
        </b>
        Purchaser’s contract claim, while unsuccessful, was advanced in good faith. While purchasers’ claim for specific performance that formed basis of lis pendens was effectively denied by the trial court’s recognition that the contract that afforded the remedy of specific performance was terminated, purchasers advanced rational arguments, based upon facts and the law, in support of its continued existence and these arguments were not groundless or otherwise spurious. At the time of recording the lis pendens, purchasers did not know or have reason to know the trial court would later find the contract to be void under § 38-33.3-312 (5). By extension, the lis pendens, while filed and recorded, was not a spurious document. Platt v. Aspenwood Condo. Ass’n, 214 P.3d 1060 (Colo. App. 2009).

        Even if a conservation deed was a “wild deed” (i.e., a deed in which the grantor was a stranger to the title, thus placing the document outside the chain of title), the purchaser had actual notice of that instrument before it purchased the property. Moreover, the deed advised the purchaser, in bold type and all-block capital letters, that the subject property was encumbered by a deed of conservation easement. In that case, the purchaser was not entitled to ignore the deed. Ranch O, LLC v. Colo. Cattlemen’s Agric. Land Trust,

         On its face, the recording statute provides a method by which a later grantee of rights in real property can, under certain circumstances, perfect its title against an earlier grantee. However, a failure of the later grantee to qualify for the benefits of the statute
        </b>
        does not necessarily mean that its interests are subordinate to those of an earlier grantee. If the later grantee has notice of the earlier unrecorded instrument or fails to record first, the recording statute simply fails to provide a mechanism for determining the priority of the competing interests, and none will be imputed to it.

         Instrument first recorded has priority.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where two trust deeds are given to secure payment of the purchase price of property, they are of equal dignity in this respect, and the one which is recorded first constitutes the senior lien of the two. Bray v. Trower, 87 Colo. 240, 286 P. 275 (1930).

       <b>
        District court correctly determined that notice of lis pendens was of no effect vis-a-vis defendant holding deed of trust on the property and, therefore, did not impair defendant’s right to foreclose on the property.
       </b>
       A notice of lis pendens is not notice to a person who acquires an interest in property from someone other than the parties named in the notice. Here, it is undisputed that the deed of trust to the subject property was not given to defendant’s assignor by plaintiffs, because defendant’s assignor did not acquire its interest in the property “by, through, or under any party named in” the notice of lis pendens. By the express language of subsection (1), therefore, the notice of lis pendens was not notice to defendant of plaintiff’s claimed interest in the property. Thomas v. Lynx United Group, LLC, 159 P.3d 789 (Colo. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Notice of lis pendens was ineffective as to defendant’s assignor because defendant’s assignor did not acquire its interest in the property “by, through, or under any party named in” the notice of lis pendens and because it could not be found in defendant’s chain of title and, therefore, failed to provide constructive notice of plaintiff’s interest in property.
       </b>
       Subsection (1) expressly provides that a notice of lis pendens must be recorded in the office of the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the real property is located. Interests in property that do not appear in the chain of title, as shown by the grantor and grantee indices, do not give notice to purchasers of those interests. Here, notice of lis pendens that failed to list record holder of title to property was outside defendant’s chain of title. As a matter of law, therefore, it did not provide constructive notice of plaintiff’s claimed interest in the property, notwithstanding that it was filed in the office of the county clerk and recorder. Accordingly, defendant properly permitted to foreclose on the deed of trust. Thomas v. Lynx United Group, LLC, 159 P.3d 789 (Colo. App. 2006).

        Where the grantor executed deeds for certain real property to the grantee under an agreement, the agreement is a security arrangement in the fullest sense since it provided for extension of existing loans, set forth the terms of future loans, and left grantor in possession and holding equitable title; therefore, the deeds are instruments which secured the payment of an obligation, and as such, they fell squarely within the provisions of this section and had the legal effect of mortgages and had to be foreclosed as such.

         Colorado has adopted by statute a lien theory of mortgages,

        which theory generally prohibits a mortgagee from acquiring possession of a mortgaged property until a foreclosure and sale have occurred. Martinez v. Cont’l Enter., 730 P.2d 308 (Colo. 1986).

         Under a lien theory, the mortgage on a deed of trust

        creates a lien against real property but does not convey title. Hohn v. Morrison, 870 P.2d 513 (Colo. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         In a lien theory jurisdiction such as Colorado,
        </b>
        a mortgage, deed of trust, or other interest “intended to secure the payment of an obligation affecting title to or an interest in real property shall not be deemed a conveyance” but is, instead, a lien; however, the fact that a mortgage or deed of trust is a security interest, rather than an ownership interest in real property, does not mean that it is not an asset. Herstam v. Bd. of Dirs., 895 P.2d 1131 (Colo. App. 1995).

         To the extent a clause in a deed of trust

         Extrinsic evidence may prove deed.

       <p>
        In an action to redeem from what purports to be an absolute sale of lands, though the object of the parties to the transaction is expressed in one or more separate writings, it is competent to prove by parol evidence that the real transaction is a mortgage, regardless of the number of writings by which it is evidenced.

      <p>
       A lender cannot place conditions on its release of a deed of trust other than the satisfaction of the indebtedness secured by that deed of trust. This conclusion is consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute, which is to permit the owners of real property to obtain the release of liens by the payment of the full amount secured by the lien and thereby permit the owner to sell, pledge, or otherwise deal with the property of the lien. If a lien holder were permitted further to condition the release of the lien, it could use that ability to coerce settlement of other disputes or accounts, a result the statute was clearly intended to prevent.

Moneys from more than one transaction may be commingled in one account, to be accounted for separately.

Such designation shall be made by sending written notification of such designation to the parties to such contract and to the county treasurer. Such notice shall include the name and legal address of the designated alternate and the date such designated alternate shall assume the duties of escrow agent. Such designated alternate shall have all of the duties and powers of the public trustee to act as escrow agent on a contract for deed to real property as stated in this section.

        Where installment land contract failed to include required provision under subsection (1)(a) designating the public trustee as escrow agent, contract violated mandate of this section, and buyers were entitled to void it.

       Haan v. Traylor, 79 P.3d 114 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon voidance of a contract under subsection (1)(a), buyers were also entitled to an award of their reasonable attorney fees and costs under subsection (3). Haan v. Traylor, 79 P.3d 114 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Buyer’s claim under subsection (3) to void installment land contract was an affirmative defense and compulsory counterclaim.
       </b>
       As such, defense and claim should have been asserted in buyer’s responsive pleading (or amended responsive pleading) or they are waived. Buyer’s claim was related to seller’s claim and, therefore, was a compulsory counterclaim. Dinosaur Park Invs., L.L.C. v. Tello, 192 P.3d 513 (Colo. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        District court erred in allowing buyer under C.R.C.P. 15(a) to amend his answer to raise defense under subsection (3) following trial after ruling before trial that he would not be permitted to raise such defense.
       </b>
       Where a defense or claim is not pleaded or intentionally and actually tried, a court cannot render a judgment thereon. This rule cannot be circumvented by allowing a party to amend his or her answer after trial where the defense or claim was not tried by express or implied consent. Dinosaur Park Invs., L.L.C. v. Tello, 192 P.3d 513 (Colo. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the district court abused its discretion in effectively permitting buyer to amend his answer after trial because seller was clearly prejudiced. Dinosaur Park Invs., L.L.C. v. Tello, 192 P.3d 513 (Colo. App. 2008).

       Abstract of magistrate’s order allocating previously undisclosed marital assets filed with county clerk and recorder by wife’s attorney and that appeared as an encumbrance against husband’s property is not a “spurious lien” under subsection (4).
       
       The magistrate’s order was an enforceable order at the time the abstract was recorded. And it was an order of a state court for purposes of subsection (4)(c). The statute does not require that a lien imposed by a court order be a judgment lien. Rather, any type of lien imposed by order, judgment, or decree of a state court cannot be spurious, regardless of how it was created or what it is called. Evans v. Evans,

     <p>
      Immediately after the filing of the abstract of title, the court shall enter an order referring the application to an examiner of titles, who shall proceed to examine into the title and into the truth of the matters set forth in the application, and particularly whether the land is occupied, the nature of the occupation if occupied, and by what right, and, also as to all judgments against the applicant or those through whom he claims title, which may be a lien upon the lands described in the application. He shall search the records and investigate all the facts brought to his notice, and file in the case a report thereon, including a certificate of his opinion upon the title. The clerk of the court shall thereupon give notice to the applicant of the filing of such report. If the opinion of the examiner is adverse to the applicant, he shall be allowed by the court a reasonable time in which to elect to proceed further, or to withdraw his application. The election shall be made in writing and filed with the clerk of the court.

      If the court, after hearing, finds that the applicant has title, whether as stated in his application or otherwise, proper for registration, a decree of confirmation of title and registration shall be entered. Every decree of registration shall bind the land and quiet the title thereto, except as otherwise provided in this article, and shall be forever binding and conclusive upon all persons, whether mentioned by name in the application or included in “all other persons or parties unknown claiming any right, title, estate, lien, or interest in, to, or upon the real estate described in the application herein”, and such decree shall not be opened by reason of the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor by any proceeding at law or in equity for reversing judgments or decrees, except as especially provided in section 38-36-131. An appeal may be taken as provided by law and the Colorado appellate rules within the same time and upon like notice, terms, and conditions as are provided for the taking of appeals from the district court to the appellate court in civil actions.

     <p>
      The registrar shall, at the time that he enters his original certificate of title, make an exact duplicate thereof, but putting on it the words, “Owner’s duplicate certificate of ownership”, and deliver the same to the owner or to his attorney duly authorized. For the purpose of preserving evidence of the signature and handwriting of the owner in his office, it is the duty of the registrar to take from the owner, in every case where it is practicable to do so, his receipt for the certificate of title, which shall be signed by the owner in person. Such receipt, when signed and delivered in the registrar’s office, shall be witnessed by the registrar or deputy registrar. If such receipt is signed elsewhere, it shall be witnessed and acknowledged in the same manner as is now provided for the acknowledgment of deeds. When so signed, such receipt shall be prima facie evidence of the genuineness of such signature.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A registered owner holding one duplicate certificate for several distinct parcels of land may surrender it and take out several certificates for portions thereof. A registered owner holding several duplicate certificates for several distinct parcels of land may surrender them and take out a single duplicate certificate for all of said parcels, or several certificates for different portions thereof. Such exchange of certificates, however, shall only be made by the order of the court upon petition therefor duly made by the owner. An owner of registered land who subdivides such land into lots, blocks, or acre tracts shall file with the registrar of titles a plat of said land so subdivided, in the same manner and subject to the same rules of law and restrictions as is provided for platting land that is not registered.

        Act of registration is practically ministerial.
       </b>
       The registrar is presumed to exercise some sound judgment in complying with the provisions of this article, yet under this section, the act of registration is practically ministerial because, when there is a doubt in the registrar’s mind, or in the mind of any person in interest, the matter can be referred to the court, and where a hearing is provided, the court determines the question, and the result is entered accordingly.

      An owner of registered land conveying the same, or any portion thereof, in fee, shall execute a deed of conveyance which the grantor shall file with the registrar of titles in the county where the land lies. The owner’s duplicate certificate shall be surrendered, at the same time, and shall be by the registrar marked “canceled”. The original certificate of title shall also be marked “canceled”. The registrar of titles shall thereupon enter in the register of titles a new certificate of title to the grantee, and shall prepare and deliver to such grantee an owner’s duplicate certificate. All encumbrances, claims, or interests adverse to the title of the registered owner shall be stated upon the new certificate, except insofar as they may be simultaneously released or discharged. When only a part of the land described in a certificate is transferred, or some estate or interest in the land remains in the transferor, a new certificate shall be issued to him for the part, estate, or interest remaining to him.

       Registration of final decree - new certificate issued.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any action affecting registered land a judgment or final decree is entitled to registration on the presentation of a certified copy of the entry thereof from the clerk of the court where the action is pending to the registrar of titles. The registrar of titles shall enter a memorial thereof upon the original certificates of title and upon the owner’s duplicate, and also upon the mortgagee’s and lessee’s duplicate, if any are outstanding. When the registered owner of such land is by such judgment or decree divested of his estate in fee to the land or any part thereof, the plaintiff or defendant shall be entitled to a new certificate of title for the land or that part thereof designated in the judgment or decree, and the registrar of titles shall enter such new certificate of title and issue a new owner’s duplicate in such manner as is provided in the case of a voluntary conveyance. No such new certificate shall be entered except upon the application to the district court of the county and upon the filing in the office of the registrar of titles an order of the court directing the entry of such new certificate.

      Whenever registered land is sold, and the same is by law subject to redemption by the owner or any other person, the purchaser is not entitled to have a new certificate of title entered until the time within which the land may be redeemed has expired. At any time after the time to redeem has expired, the purchaser may petition the court for an order directing the entry of a new certificate of title to him, and the court shall, after such notice as it may order and hearing, grant and make an order directing the entry of such new certificate of title.

      The heirs at law and devisees, upon the death of an owner of lands, and any estate or interest therein, registered pursuant to this article, on the expiration of thirty days after the entry of a decree of the district or probate court granting letters testamentary or of administration, or in case of an appeal from such decree, at any time after the entry of a final decree, may file a certified copy of the final decree of the district or probate court and of the will, if any, with the clerk of the district court in the county in which the land lies, and make application to the court for an order for the entry of a new certificate of title. The court shall issue notice to the executor or administrator and all other persons in interest, and may also give notice by publication in such newspaper as it may deem proper, to all whom it may concern and, after hearing, may direct the entry of a new certificate to the person who appears to be entitled thereto as heir or devisee. Any new certificate so entered before the final settlement of the estate of the deceased owner in the district or probate court shall state expressly that it is entered by transfer from the last certificate by descent or devise, and that the estate is in process of settlement. After the final settlement of the estate in the district or probate court, or after the expiration of the time allowed by law for bringing an action against an executor or administrator by creditors of the deceased, the heirs at law or devisees may petition the court for an order to cancel the memorial upon their certificates stating that the estate is in course of settlement, and the court, after such notice as it may order and hearing, may grant the petition. The liability of registered land to be sold for claims against the estate of the deceased shall not in any way be diminished or changed.

Thereupon, the court, being satisfied as to the truth of such return, shall order final judgment against the treasurer for the amount of the execution and costs, or so much thereof as remains unpaid. The county treasurer shall, upon such order of the court and final judgment, pay the amount of such judgment out of the assurance fund. It is the duty of the county attorney to appear and defend all such actions. If the funds in the assurance fund at any time are insufficient to pay any judgment in full, the balance unpaid shall draw interest at the legal rate of interest and be paid with such interest out of the first funds coming into said fund.

No instrument that was filed or recorded in any other public office before the recording as provided in this part 2, but that was not duly registered, is effective or constitutes public notice as to those lands as a result of the recording; except that the instrument may be recorded thereafter.

        Because this section authorizes payment by electronic transfer of funds and the office of the public trustee is required to stay open during regular business hours, the public trustee’s bank must accept electronic transfers during regular business hours.
       </b>
       Thus, the trial court erred in refusing to grant an extension for redemption of property where the plaintiff attempted to pay by electronic transfer of funds, but was prevented by the public trustee’s bank, which had closed early. Buell v. White, 908 P.2d 1175 (Colo. App. 1995).

       Plaintiffs failed to provide to defendant, in writing, a notice of change of address. Defendant thus utilized address specified in the deed of trust to serve its motion and notice under C.R.C.P. 120 and to provide the public trustee with plaintiffs’ most current address. The plain language of the deed of trust expresses the parties’ intentions concerning notice and changes of address. Defendant’s adherence to the deed of trust’s notice provision complied with the notice requirements of C.R.C.P. 120(a). Thus, the notice provision in the deed of trust and defendant’s compliance with that provision comported with the requirements of C.R.C.P. 120(a). Estates in Eagle Ridge, LLLP v.

       <b>
        Annotator’s note.
       </b>
       Since § 38-38-104 is similar to § 38-39-118 as it existed prior to the 1990 repeal and reenactment of this article and article 39, relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Applicability of section.
       </b>
       This section applies only where foreclosure action has been initiated. Certified Realty Corp. v. Smith, 198 Colo. 222, 597 P.2d 1043 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to a situation where default in the terms of a note and deed of trust consists, not only of nonpayment of principal and interest, but also of failure to pay real property taxes. Foster Lumber Co. v. Weston Constructors, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 436, 521 P.2d 1294 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Section modified common law by limiting acceleration right.
       </b>
       This section has modified the common law by limiting right of acceleration. Foster Lumber Co. v. Weston Constructors, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 436, 521 P.2d 1294 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the action involves only a default of payment and the deed of trust or mortgage is being foreclosed, this section limits the effectiveness of an acceleration clause. Smith v. Certified Realty Corp., 41 Colo. App. 170, 585 P.2d 293 (1978), aff’d, 198 Colo. 222, 597 P.2d 1043 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Section prevents foreclosure if creditor’s interests not jeopardized.
       </b>
       This section must be interpreted so as to carry out its general legislative intent which was to permit debtors to prevent foreclosure of mortgages or deeds of trust in instances in which the creditor’s interests will not be jeopardized. Foster Lumber Co. v. Weston Constructors, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 436, 521 P.2d 1294 (1974); Jacobs Invs. v. PRD Holdings, Ltd., 44 Colo. App. 184, 612 P.2d 1149 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And cures default on note, deed of trust, or mortgage.
       </b>
       This section specifically refers to defaults on “the note, deed of trust, or mortgage” and was obviously intended to permit a debtor to cure a default in the terms of either instrument. Foster Lumber Co. v. Weston Constructors, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 436, 521 P.2d 1294 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Section does not limit the number of times a debtor can cure defaults.
       </b>
       Jacobs Invs. v. PRD Holdings, Ltd., 44 Colo. App. 184, 612 P.2d 1149 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) protects the creditor from the allegation that he has waived his future right to accelerate and to foreclose upon default because the debtor was able to cure defaults at an earlier time. Jacobs Invs. v. PRD Holdings, Ltd., 44 Colo. App. 184, 612 P.2d 1149 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No equitable right to cure default in action on promissory note.
       </b>
       There is no equitable right to cure default in action brought solely on promissory note. Smith v. Certified Realty Corp., 41 Colo. App. 170, 585 P.2d 293 (1978), aff’d, 198 Colo. 222, 597 P.2d 1043 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Postponement of sale also postpones deadline for curing default.
       </b>
       When the date of a foreclosure sale is postponed, the deadline for curing the default, notice to the public trustee of intention to cure at least seven days prior to the sale, is correspondingly postponed. Kirchner v. Sanchez, 661 P.2d 1161 (Colo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Acceleration clause enforceable.
       </b>
       Where suit after default of payment is on the note only and the creditor does not bring an action to foreclose on the security, i.e., the deed of trust, the acceleration clause in the note is enforceable, and the debtor has no statutory or equitable right to cure the money default. Smith v. Certified Realty Corp., 41 Colo. App. 170, 585 P.2d 293 (1978), aff’d, 198 Colo. 222, 597 P.2d 1043 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Statutory coverage triggered by initiation of foreclosure proceedings.
       </b>
       Because by its terms this section applies only to deeds of trust or mortgages “being foreclosed” and the statutory mechanism for tender operates through the public trustees or other officers “conducting the sale”, statutory coverage is triggered by initiation of foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage or deed of trust. Foster Lumber Co. v. Weston Constructors, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 436, 521 P.2d 1294 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Attorney fees.
       </b>
       When a deed of trust is foreclosed as a mortgage, the court may award attorney fees. Bakers Park Mining &amp; Milling Co. v. District Court, 662 P.2d 483 (Colo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        To cure default,
       </b>
       debtor is required to pay interest at the default rate on the entire balance of the debt for the period during which the note was in default plus all delinquent principal. Foothills Apartments v. Fischer, 693 P.2d 395 (Colo. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No partial cure of default.
       </b>
       Default is either cured or not cured, and if “cured” then it is as if no default occurred. The effect of curing default under the foreclosure statute is to put parties in the same position as they would have been had no default occurred. Foothills Apartments v. Fischer, 693 P.2d 395 (Colo. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Parties returned to original status following timely tender.
       </b>
       This section allows one liable, under a note and deed of trust or mortgage, whose only default is nonpayment, to cure the default by tender of the delinquent payments due plus costs, late charges, and attorneys’ fees. If such a tender is made within five (now seven) days of the foreclosure sale, the foreclosure action is terminated and the parties are returned to their original status. Ulander v. Allen, 37 Colo. App. 279, 544 P.2d 1001 (1976).

       The following annotations include cases decided under this section as it existed prior to its 2006 repeal and reenactment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A deficiency bid that is not a good faith estimate of the fair market value of the property does not invalidate the foreclosure sale;
       </b>
       instead, the debtor’s deficiency liability is adjusted to reflect what the deficiency should have been had a good faith bid been made at the time of the sale. First Nat. Bank v. Blanding, 885 P.2d 324 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Inadequate foreclosure bid, or bid not in “good faith”, does not bar recovery of a deficiency judgment rather inadequacy should be considered only to adjust amount of deficiency claim.
       </b>
       Bank of Am. v. Kosovich, 878 P.2d 65 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plain meaning of subsection (6)
       
       is to provide debtors with a defense that they may assert but that they may also waive. The general assembly could have included an express prohibition against waiver of subsection (6) as it has done in other statutes, but presumably it chose not to. In addition, the ability to waive the provisions of subsection (6) does not violate public policy. Armed Forces Bank v. Hicks,
       <cite class="co_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trial court properly concluded that no formal notice of acceleration was required under the terms of the note, and commencement of a foreclosure action was sufficient to accelerate the obligation secured by the deed of trust.
       </b>
       Kirk v. Kitchens, 49 P.3d 1189 (Colo. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trial court erred in allowing defendants to include in their foreclosure bids as “amounts due” future interest amounts.
       </b>
       Upon defendants’ acceleration of the entire loan obligation, defendants had waived or were no longer entitled to recover the contested amounts, which would constitute an impermissible prepayment penalty not authorized by the note and deed of trust in the event of foreclosure. Kirk v. Kitchens, 49 P.3d 1189 (Colo. App. 2002).

If different interest rates are specified in the evidence of debt, deed of trust, or other lien being foreclosed, the interest rate specified in the evidence of debt shall prevail. If the evidence of debt does not specify an interest rate, including a default interest rate, applicable interest rate as specified in the deed of trust or other lien being foreclosed shall apply.

         Or sale set aside.
        </b>
        A court is not justified in invoking its equity powers to set aside a sale or extend the redemption period unless there have been circumstances such as fraud, deceit, or collusion by the purchaser, or unless a holder of a right of redemption has been misled by erroneous information as to the applicable redemption period. Davis Mfg. &amp; Supply Co. v. Coonskin Props., Inc., 646 P.2d 940 (Colo. App. 1982).

       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a redemption from a sale of real estate under execution, the certificate of sale becomes void, and a sheriff’s deed issued thereon is a nullity. Floyd v. Sellers, 7 Colo. App. 491, 44 P. 371 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        The payment of the money by defendant, with the purpose of redemption, to the sheriff who sold the land on execution, and its receipt by the latter without objection, nullifies and abrogates the sale as between defendant and the purchaser, though the sheriff has not formally canceled the certificate of purchase, nor directed the execution of a certificate of redemption and though he has subsequently executed a deed of the land to the purchaser.

        <b>
         General rule as to payment.

        <b>
         Where equitable extension of redemption period appropriate.

        Where holders of right of redemption relied on the public trustee’s mistake as to whether the six-month period of redemption for agricultural property or the 75-day period for nonagricultural property applied and where there was an inadequate sales price at foreclosure sale, equitable extension of the period of redemption was an appropriate remedy. Arnold v. Gebhardt, 43 Colo. App. 387, 604 P.2d 1192 (1979); Johnson v. Smith, 651 P.2d 422 (Colo. App. 1982).

         Redemption period may not be extended, absent wrongdoing.
        </b>
        The bankruptcy court cannot exercise its equity power to extend the redemption period established by subsection (2), absent guilt of wrongdoing by the party seeking the foreclosure, which adversely affects the debtor’s right of redemption. In re Headley, 13 B.R. 295 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1981).

         Inadequacy of sale price not enough to set aside sale.
        </b>
        Inadequacy of sales price at foreclosure sale, standing alone, does not warrant setting aside the sale but it may be considered as one of the factors which requires the court to employ an equitable remedy for the holders of the right of redemption. Arnold v. Gebhardt, 43 Colo. App. 387, 604 P.2d 1192 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        A disparity between the market value and the price paid at sale is not controlling and, standing alone, is not sufficient cause for setting aside a sale or extending a redemption period. Davis Mfg. &amp; Supply Co. v. Coonskin Props., Inc., 646 P.2d 940 (Colo. App. 1982).

        Where premises are leased, the landlord is entitled to both the rents and the reversion, and when the reversion of the landlord is transferred, the rights to rents accruing after the transfer of the reversion pass to the transferee; therefore, when the landlord’s interest in the demised premises are transferred to a purchaser on a sheriff’s sale on foreclosure, the rights to the rents reserved in the lease pass to the purchaser and, after the sheriff’s sale and the failure to redeem by either the owner or the mortgagee, the purchasers acquired the rights to the rents, profits accruing after the right of redemption expired.

        </b>
        Where the grantor in a deed of trust conveyed his equity of redemption before foreclosure and, at the foreclosure sale, the property did not sell for enough to pay off his note, both he and his grantee of the equity of redemption have sufficient interest and are proper parties to maintain an action to set aside the foreclosure sale on the ground that it was illegal and void.

       </p>
       <p>
        Mining property is not ordinarily considered to be agricultural. However, since it is apparent that for redemption purposes the general assembly sought only to distinguish undeveloped rural lands from developed urbanized property, the statutory definition here places both agricultural and mining property in the same category. Rowe v. Tucker, 38 Colo. App. 532, 560 P.2d 843 (1977).

       Since § 38-38-305 is similar to § 38-39-106 as it existed prior to the 1990 repeal and reenactment of this article and article 39, relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations to this section.

       <b>
        An implied lease based on the terms of an earlier pre-foreclosure lease was created
       </b>
       since the property owner/landlord accepted monthly payments from the tenant and did not renounce the prior agreement. Tanktech, Inc. v. First Interstate Bank, 851 P.2d 174 (Colo. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because a property lessee is considered a lienor under this section,
       </b>
       upon foreclosure of a senior security interest, any subordinate leases, liens, or encumbrances are extinguished once the applicable redemption period has expired. First Interstate Bank v. Tanktech, Inc., 864 P.2d 116 (Colo. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A right of redemption may not be severed from the property interest it serves.
       </b>
       Backhart v. HTS Props., LLC, 981 P.2d 208 (Colo. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not require an installment land contract vendor to foreclose upon default as a matter of law.
       </b>
       Instead, the section describes when certain redemption rights and rights to cure a default exist. The section simply codifies previously existing equitable rights of redemption that were recognized by courts of equity. Paraguay Place-View Trust v. Gray, 981 P.2d 681 (Colo. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this does not mean that the provisions of this section have no application when there is a default in an installment land contract. When a default occurs in such a contract and the vendor seeks to obtain possession, the vendor may initiate a forcible entry and detainer (FED) action. Thereafter, a court may determine whether the vendor can proceed by way of FED action or, instead, must proceed by way of foreclosure. If the court requires foreclosure, the vendor must foreclose under the terms of article 38 and, under this section, the vendee has a right to cure and a right of redemption. Paraguay Place-View Trust v. Gray, 981 P.2d 681 (Colo. App. 1999).

       Rights of other lienors to redeem - definition.

       A judgment creditor whose judgment has been made a lien of record and who has complied with the other conditions of a lienor required by this article may redeem as a lienor.
      </li>
      <li id="t38a38p03s38-38-306ol12">
       A mechanic’s lien claimant or any other person claiming the right to a statutory lien on real property shall have the right to redeem as a lienor despite the fact that the claim has not been reduced to judgment, if the lien or lien claim has been recorded as required or permitted by statute and the holder thereof has complied with the other conditions required of a lienor by this article. If another lienor redeems after such lien claimant, that portion of the redemption amount attributable to the claim of such lien claimant, as evidenced by such claimant’s recorded lien, shall be held in escrow by the officer until a final judgment has been entered in favor of such claimant confirming the claimant’s right to a lien and all periods for appeal have expired, whereupon there shall be paid to such claimant from the escrow the amount of the lien claim as established by the judgment, with any interest earned thereon, and the balance, if any, shall be refunded to the borrower, so long as the last redeeming lienor has otherwise been satisfied. If the claimant releases the lien or fails to establish a right to the lien, the entire escrow shall be paid to the borrower, so long as the last redeeming lienor has otherwise been satisfied. Lien claimants of equal priority, for the purposes of this subsection (2), may act in concert and be deemed to represent one claim in which they share pro rata. The right of the borrower to excess sale proceeds pursuant to a homestead exemption under section 38-41-201 is subordinate to the right of a subsequent deed of trust beneficiary for whose benefit the homestead exemption was waived.

        Annotator’s note.
       </b>
       Since § 38-38-501 is similar to § 38-39-110 as it existed prior to the 1990 repeal and reenactment of this article and article 39, relevant cases construing that provision have been included in the annotations to this section.

       <b>
        The purpose of this section
       </b>
       is to render titles to real property absolute and free of technical defects so that a subsequent purchaser of a public trustee’s deed may rely on the record title, but a purchaser is bound to investigate when the record indicates the existence of an outside interest by which the title may be affected and is charged with knowledge of the facts to which the investigation would have led. Ragsdale Bros. Roofing v. United Bank, 744 P.2d 750 (Colo. App. 1987).

       The holder of a certificate of purchase on an execution sale acquires only the alternative rights to receive the redemption money, in case of a redemption, or a deed for the land after the time for redemption has expired. Davis Mfg. &amp; Supply Co. v. Coonskin Props., Inc., 646 P.2d 940 (Colo. App. 1982).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Plaintiff held no redemption right upon expiration of the redemption period
       </b>

       Title remains in the mortgagors unless and until the holder of the certificate of purchase takes the affirmative act of applying for a deed, and the public trustee issues a deed. These affirmative acts are what 11 U.S.C. § 362 stays. In re Murphy, 22 B.R. 663 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1982).

        “Free and clear” voids prior agreements respecting use of property.

       <b>
        The language “free and clear” means free of any subordinate leases

       Court of appeals’ opinion, which was unclear as to whether the court regarded a subordinate, pre-foreclosure lease as having been extinguished under this section, reversed to the extent the opinion held the lease was extended. First Interstate Bank v. Tanktech, Inc., 864 P.2d 116 (Colo. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When a deed of trust is foreclosed, the issuance of a certificate of purchase voids all junior liens,

       unless a redemption occurs, and the title received is free and clear of all unredeemed junior encumbrances. Ferguson Enters. v. Keybuild Solutions, 275 P.3d 741 (Colo. App. 2011).

       Where a debtor commences a bankruptcy action before a deed is executed to the holder of a certificate of purchase, the debtor retains title to the property and the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over it. Benford-Whiting Co. v. Robertson, 4 B.R. 213 (D. Colo. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        With the exception of defective notice to municipality, under version of section in effect at the time of subject foreclosure, foreclosure was proper.
       </b>
       Therefore, title vested in partnership as grantee of the public trustee’s deed, free and clear of the other plaintiffs’ judgment liens. Based on this conclusion, trial court’s order attaching other plaintiffs’ original judgment liens to the ranch must be reversed except as to the municipality. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs v. Sportsmen’s Ranch, 271 P.3d 562 (Colo. App. 2011) (decided under law in effect prior to 2006 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because municipality did not receive notice of foreclosure, partnership took title to ranch subject to municipality’s judgment lien. That conclusion is supported by former version of this section. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs v. Sportsmen’s Ranch, 271 P.3d 562 (Colo. App. 2011) (decided under law in effect prior to 2006 amendment).

       <b>
        Applicability of section.
       </b>
       The section applies primarily to the obligation of the owner of the premises while in possession and the rights of the holder of the certificate of purchase, where the owner abandons possession. Ginsberg v. Bennett, 101 Colo. 121, 71 P.2d 419 (1937).

        Section puts affirmative duty on the mortgagor in possession during the redemption period
       </b>
       to keep the premises in repair, use reasonable diligence to keep the premises yielding an adequate income, and to pay current taxes before penalties accrue. Schwab v. Martin, 165 Colo. 547, 441 P.2d 17 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Although the owners had a right to remain on the property during the redemption period, they also had a duty to prevent waste, including paying the taxes, insurance, and interest on prior encumbrances on the property.
       </b>
       However, because the purchasers did not pay any insurance premiums on the property and because the owners’ obligations to pay interest under the first and second deeds of trust were extinguished in bankruptcy, the purchasers are not entitled to recover for these items. Elrick v. Merrill, 10 P.3d 689 (Colo. App. 2000).

      <p>
       <b>
        Purchasers entitled to appointment of receiver.
       </b>
       The purchasers who had surrendered their notes and deeds of trust to the public trustee were entitled to appointment of a receiver after sale, both under the terms of their deeds of trust and under this section which specifically authorizes appointment of a receiver after sale where there is danger of waste. Schwab v. Martin, 165 Colo. 547, 441 P.2d 17 (1968).

        Receivership for property’s protection inures to owner’s benefit.

       Under this section and the general law as announced both prior, and subsequent, to the enactment of this section, a mortgagee, even though the rents are pledged as security, until he takes some effectual step to subject them to the payment of his debt, has but an inchoate or passive lien on such rentals. Moncreiff v. Hare, 38 Colo. 221, 87 P. 1082 (1906); Fisher v. Norman Apts., Inc., 101 Colo. 173, 72 P.2d 1092 (1937); Megginson v. Hall, 111 Colo. 104, 137 P.2d 411 (1943).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The lien of any mortgage encumbering property within the state of Colorado can be released only by the mortgagee executing a separate instrument of release executed under the formalities prescribed by the law regulating conveyances. All releases made prior to July 1, 1973, either on the mortgage or on the record of the mortgage, and signed by the mortgagee, shall have the same effect as a separate instrument of release legally executed by the mortgagee.

        Presumption of satisfaction overcome by showing of late interest payment.

       The production of a note by the plaintiff at the trial, showing payment of interest months after the date of alleged payment, is sufficient to overcome any presumption arising from the record of a satisfaction of a mortgage securing a note of like description.

This subparagraph (II) applies regardless of whether the interest rate, points, fees, and charges paid or payable by the consumer in connection with the refinancing exceed any thresholds specified by law.

        The proceedings on the application, standing alone, did not dispossess the claimant, did not constitute an entry on the land sufficient to reinstate the record owner in possession, did not constitute legal action to regain possession of the land or the equivalent of such an action, and did not result in the ejectment of plaintiff or its predecessors in interest.

         A party who claims a prescriptive easement

       </p>
       <p>

         A prescriptive easement is acquired when the use is open or notorious,
        </b>
        continuous without effective interruption for an 18-year period, and either adverse or pursuant to an attempted but ineffective grant. Intermittent use on a long-term basis is sufficient to satisfy the open, notorious, and continuous use requirement, and using an easement for 18 years entitles the holder to the presumption that the use was adverse. Clinger v. Hartshorn, 89 P.3d 462 (Colo. App. 2003).

        <b>
         This section applies to an action seeking to terminate an easement by adverse possession
        </b>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         An easement will be terminated by adverse possession upon a showing that

         Abandonment is not an element of a claim to terminate an easement by adverse possession,

       <p>
        <b>
         A claim to terminate an easement by adverse possession requires a stronger showing of adverse use than a claim to create an easement by adverse possession does.
        </b>
        A party claiming to have terminated an easement by adverse possession must prove that the use interferes significantly enough with the easement owner’s enjoyment of the easement to give notice that the easement is under threat. Matoush v. Lovingood, 177 P.3d 1262 (Colo. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Determining whether use of the easement area is an incompatible or irreconcilable use sufficiently adverse to trigger the statutorily mandated period of time for adverse possession of an easement
        </b>
        depends upon whether the easement was expressly created and whether the easement has ever been used by the easement holder. Matoush v. Lovingood, 177 P.3d 1262 (Colo. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         When an easement is expressly created but never used,
        </b>
        use of the easement area is not adverse and will not trigger the statutorily mandated period of time for adverse possession until the easement holder needs to use the easement, demands to use it, and is denied the right to use it. Matoush v. Lovingood, 177 P.3d 1262 (Colo. 2008).

         A barrier established for the purpose of, and in fact, interrupting an adverse claimant’s use is sufficient to interrupt the running of the statutory period,

         Interest matures into absolute fee after statutory duration.

        Conveyance of a water right, serving to transform a previous permissive use of water by a canal company to a use which is adverse and inconsistent with the previous relationship of the parties, begins the running of the statute of limitations against a suit for possession or to determine ownership of the water right.

         Possession must be hostile.

        The very essence of adverse possession is that the possession must be hostile, not only against the true owner, but against the world as well. Lovejoy v. Sch. Dist. No. 46, 129 Colo. 306, 269 P.2d 1067 (1954); Smith v. Town of Fowler, 138 Colo. 359, 333 P.2d 1034 (1959); Sanchez v. Taylor, 377 F.2d 733 (10th Cir. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Adverse claim must be hostile at its inception, because, if the original entry is not openly hostile or adverse, it does not become so, and this section does not begin to run as against a rightful owner until an adverse claimant disavows the idea of holding for, or in subservience to another, it actually sets up an exclusive right in himself by some clear, positive and unequivocal act. Lovejoy v. Sch. Dist. No. 46, 129 Colo. 306, 269 P.2d 1067 (1954); Smith v. Town of Fowler, 138 Colo. 359, 333 P.2d 1034 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The character of the possession must become hostile in order that it may be deemed to be adverse, and this hostility must continue for the full statutory period because this section begins to run at the time the possession of the claimant becomes adverse to that of the owner, and this occurs when the claimant sets up title in himself by some clear, positive, and unequivocal act.

        <b>
         Hostile and adverse requirement does not mean violence.

        The court has found hostile and adverse possession even though the adverse possessor had stated that he was claiming only to what he believed to be the true boundary of his land and had no intention of claiming the land of another; all that is required to establish hostility is that the person claiming adverse possession occupy the property with belief that the property is his and not another’s.

         Trial court must make determination where evidence conflicting.
        </b>
        Where evidence is conflicting on the issue of whether use of land was continuously adverse for the statutory period, the trial court is required to make a specific finding as to each of the prerequisites of adverse possession. Hayden v. Morrison, 152 Colo. 435, 382 P.2d 1003 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         To acquire a prescriptive easement, a party must confine his or her use to a single, definite, and certain path.
        </b>
        Minor deviations do not defeat the claimed easement. Whether the route remained substantially the same is a factual determination for the court. The development of a new subdivision, rather than a circumstance over which plaintiffs had any control, required plaintiffs to change their point of entrance to defendants’ property. Accordingly, the record supports trial court’s determination that plaintiffs adequately proved their use of a definite path across defendants’ property for more than the prescriptive period of 18 years specified under this section. Weisiger v. Harbour, 62 P.3d 1069 (Colo. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Using an easement for more than 18 years entitles the holder to the presumption that use was adverse;
        </b>
        however this presumption can be rebutted by showing the use was permissive. Trial court’s conclusion that defendants’ evidence of permissive use, based upon an arrangement of two locks on a gate separating defendants’ property, one for each party, was insufficient to overcome the presumption of adverse use. Weisiger v. Harbour, 62 P.3d 1069 (Colo. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         To satisfy the open and notorious element for establishment of a prescriptive easement, the use must be sufficiently obvious to apprise the owner of the servient estate;
        </b>
        however, actual knowledge by the owner need not be proved. Unlike a party claiming title to land by adverse possession, a party claiming a prescriptive easement need not be in continuous physical possession of the land because a prescriptive easement is only a right to use the route whenever the holder desires passage. The record supports trial court’s determination that plaintiffs’ use was open and notorious because defendants knew plaintiffs were entering their property and using the mining road. In addition, the record also supports trial court’s determination that plaintiffs crossed defendants’ property whenever they wanted to reach their property. Intermittent use on a long-term basis satisfies the requirement for open, notorious, and continuous use. Weisiger v. Harbour, 62 P.3d 1069 (Colo. App. 2002).

         Reviewing court may reject trial court’s finding where conclusions unsupported.
        </b>
        Although it is true that whether possession is hostile or adverse is ordinarily a question of fact, and a finding on this issue made by the trial court would normally not be set aside on review, this restraint does not limit the power of the reviewing court to reject a trial court’s findings and conclusions where they are not supported by evidence or where the law has not been correctly applied.

       A recognition of record title does not demonstrate an intent not to possess adversely where there is no dispute in the evidence of adverse possession of the disputed property; the very fact that the plaintiffs recognized that the record title of a portion of the property was not in their names, enforced and strengthened the claim of adverse possession. Schoenherr v. Campbell, 172 Colo. 306, 472 P.2d 139 (1970).

       or by physical barriers, the claim is limited to the property actually occupied by the claimant and such occupancy is a question of fact for the trial court to determine. Such occupancy does not require constant, visible occupancy or physical improvement on all parts of the parcel, but rather the ordinary use for which the land is suitable and which an owner of the land would make of it. Similarly, possession need not be absolutely exclusive in order to attain the degree of exclusivity required for adverse possession. Smith v. Hayden, 772 P.2d 47 (Colo. 1989).

       Although the statute of limitations provides sufficient protection for the purchasers of property under tax deeds without further limitations being imposed by the courts, until the applicable periods of limitation have expired, tax deeds, even though valid on their face, are subject to attack for irregularities in the proceedings; otherwise, there would be no need for statute of limitations.

       </b>
       A covenant in a warranty deed, requiring grantee to construct a house of a stated value within a prescribed time upon the land conveyed, and providing that upon grantee’s default the property was to revert to the grantor, is a “restriction concerning real property” within the meaning of this section; thus, an action to enforce the restriction, commenced 21 months after the expiration date stated in the covenant, was barred by this section. Wolf v. Hallenbeck, 109 Colo. 70, 123 P.2d 412 (1942).

        Equitable relief and money damages barred.
       </b>
       The word “enforce”, as used in § 38-41-119 in relation to contractual obligations, embraces a remedy of money damages as well as equitable relief. Section 38-41-119 was meant to apply to any action to enforce a building restriction, regardless of the nature of the relief requested. The nature of the right that plaintiff seeks to exercise controls the applicability of the statute of limitations. Therefore, plaintiff’s tardy claim for equitable relief, in the form of removal of encroaching improvements that violate the PUD setback area requirement, and money damages is barred by the statute of limitations of § 38-41-119. McDowell v. U.S., 870 P.2d 656 (Colo. App. 1994).

        is to place the property designated as a homestead out of the reach of creditors while occupied as a home, and this is so even though the designation of the property as a homestead occurred after the debt was contracted and immediately before the creditor had attached or levied upon the property, and though the debtor had no other property liable for his debt.

        Debtor cannot claim a homestead exemption because he did not own real property. What he received upon the death of his mother was an undivided one-third interest in her probate estate, which happened to include a piece of real property. His rights in the probate estate became the property of the bankruptcy estate and at that time he was not an owner of real property.

       <p>
        Married individuals living apart in jointly owned properties are each entitled to claim a homestead as exempt. The filing of a joint petition in bankruptcy, however, effected a severance in the joint tenancy of the debtors in each of the properties, with the result that an undivided one-half interest in the husband’s estate became the property of the wife, which property became property of the wife’s bankruptcy estate, and vice versa. Thus the trustee is entitled to one-half of the homestead exemption and one-half of the remaining equity in each property. In re Pastrana, 216 B.R. 948 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1998).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, as the cost of conventional housing continues to escalate, mobile homes will become an ever larger percentage of the total housing supply, particularly for the elderly and the low-to-moderate income groups; that the purchase of a mobile home is a major investment; that most mobile homes are permanently or semipermanently located; that great improvements have been made in the quality and variety of such homes; and that mobile homes are dwellings which should be accorded a status equivalent to conventional homes. The general assembly recognizes, however, that mobile homes are more readily moved than conventional homes; that they are presently bought and sold as personal property and that there are advantages to both the industry and consumers to continue this practice; and that they presently have a dual nature in the area of taxation and tax collection; therefore mobile homes should be entitled to a homestead exemption.

         Homestead entry on deed technically void is valid.
        </b>
        The uniform holding that a homestead entry made upon a deed confessedly void (because executed in fraud of creditors) is sufficient to secure the exemption, would seem to justify the conclusion that an entry upon some other instrument, in form evidence of title, legal or equitable, is also sufficient, although for reasons not appearing upon the face of the instrument, the court might, when properly raised upon trial, hold that said instrument was, in law, something different than it appeared to be, or, for some reasons, was defective or void.

         Effect of void deed executed by one joint tenant.
        </b>
        Because a deed affecting homesteaded property executed by one of two joint tenants is void, that deed may not be utilized to defeat the homestead act’s policy of protecting both owners of homesteaded property from disenfranchisement by the unilateral conduct of one joint tenant.

        In determining which liens will be used to calculate a homestead exemption, the court uses only those liens or encumbrances which existed prior to the placement of the homestead right on the property, which exemption is established automatically from the date of the property owner’s occupancy (except with respect to liens which arose prior to July 1, 1975), and liens with respect to which the debtor has expressly waived the homestead exemption.

       A vague intention to return perhaps at some future time and reside there again will not preserve the claimant’s home, because the intention which is sufficient to rebut the presumption of abandonment must be positive and certain, not conditional or indefinite.

        Removal of family from homestead makes prima facie case of abandonment.

        Fact that debtors were not residing in the home on the bankruptcy petition date created a presumption of abandonment; however,

      The proceeds from the exempt amount under this part 2, in the event the property is sold by the owner, or the proceeds from such sale under section 38-41-206 paid to the owner of the property or person entitled to the homestead shall be exempt from execution or attachment for a period of two years after such sale if the person entitled to such exemption keeps the exempted proceeds separate and apart from other moneys so that the same may be always identified. If the person receiving such proceeds uses said proceeds in the acquisition of other property for a home, there shall be carried over to the new property the same homestead exemption to which the owner was entitled on the property sold. Such homestead exemption shall not be valid as against one entitled to a vendor’s lien or the holder of a purchase money mortgage against said new property.

     <p>
      If the owner of such lease neglects or refuses to execute a release as provided by section 38-42-104, then the owner of the leased premises may sue in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such release, and he may also recover in such action from the lessee, his successors, or assigns the sum of one hundred dollars as damages and all costs, together with a reasonable attorney’s fee for preparing and prosecuting the suit, and he may also recover any additional damages that the evidence in the case warrants. In all such actions, writs of attachment may issue as in other cases if the owner of the leased premises makes demand for release in writing, by certified or registered mail, sent to the last-known address of the lessee, successor, or assignee, as the case may be, at least thirty days prior to instituting an action under this section.

The court, in its discretion, may order the leasing of said property to be conducted at public sale upon such notice and in such manner as the court shall direct. In the event of a public sale, such sale shall be reported back to the court and no lease shall be executed and delivered by the trustee until and unless the sale of said lease is approved by the court.

       Terms of lease: Pooling and unitization.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any lease which covers minerals or natural resources other than oil or gas or related hydrocarbons shall be for such term and contain such provisions as may be approved by the court. A lease which specifically covers oil and gas and which may also cover other minerals may be for a primary term not exceeding ten years and as long thereafter as oil, or gas, or other minerals may be produced from the premises embraced in such lease or as long as drilling operations are diligently continued. Such oil and gas lease may provide for pooling, unitization, or consolidation of the leased premises, or any part thereof, with other lands in the same general area to establish a cooperative or unit plan of development or operation and for the apportionment of royalties on production from any such unitized area on an acreage basis. The trustee appointed under this article, or any successor trustee, shall have the power at any time while such trust continues, with the approval of the court, to enter into any agreement providing for such pooling or unitization of all or any part of the leased premises and to bind thereby the said property and all owners thereof having any interest therein whether present, future, or contingent.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any suitable person, bank, or trust company may be appointed trustee under this article, and if a trust is in existence and there is a trustee serving under the trust, the trustee appointed by the court under this section may, in the court’s discretion, be the same trustee as is serving under the existing trust, even though he is not a resident of this state, and may be acting under the control of any other court in the United States. The trustee shall be under the continuing control of the court and may be removed by the court at will. Upon such removal or upon the death or resignation of the trustee or any of them, the court may appoint a successor. The court may in its sole discretion, at any time it may be deemed advisable, require such trustee to give a bond in favor of the owners of the property which is to be or has been leased, and shall fix the amount of such bond and may from time to time require a bond in additional amounts. Said trustee shall be allowed as compensation for his services such sums as the court from time to time may fix, to be paid from moneys collected by him.

      Where any lease has been executed under the provisions of this article, the title of the lessee under such lease shall be indefeasible by any party to the suit, or by any person who was virtually represented therein by any party to the suit, or by any person who was not in being at the time the suit was commenced. If the decree or order under which such lease was executed is afterwards reversed or set aside for any reason, except for fraud, collusion, or other misconduct of the purchaser or lessee, the title of such purchaser or lessee shall not be affected thereby; but all subsequent orders and decrees shall affect only the proceeds of sale or the reversion subject to such lease, together with the proceeds, rentals, and royalties payable under the terms of the lease.

     <p>
      The proceeds of sale, and the reversion subject to any such lease for the development of minerals, including oil, gas, and other natural resources, or any of them, together with the proceeds, rentals, and royalties accruing from any such lease, shall, in all respects, be substituted for and stand in place of the property so leased, as regards the ownership and enjoyment thereof, and all persons shall have the same estates or interests, vested, contingent, or executory in such proceeds of sale, or in the reversion subject to any such lease, together with the proceeds, rentals, and royalties accruing from any such lease as they had or would have had in the property so leased. The proceeds of sale or bonus and rentals payable under the terms of such lease coming into the hands of the trustee may be paid, under proper order of court, to the life tenant or other person entitled thereto. Under proper order of court, the trustee shall be authorized to invest and reinvest funds and income from royalties coming into his hands in such securities as fiduciaries are authorized to invest the moneys in their custody, which investments shall remain intact until the ultimate taker is determined and shall then be paid over to such ultimate taker as ordered by the court and the trust closed. Income from investments shall be paid to the life tenant or other person entitled thereto under proper order of court. The court shall make all proper orders and decrees for the faithful application of the funds and for the management and preservation of any property or securities in which the same may be invested for the protection of the rights of all persons having any estate or interest in the leased property, whether vested, contingent, or executory.

         Intention of parties controls.

        In construing a deed, the object is to discover and effectuate the intention of the parties to it, but while that intention is to be gathered from the language and words of the deed, it should be read in the light of the surrounding circumstances at least when it is ambiguous.

Wallace v. Hirsch, 142 Colo. 264, 350 P.2d 560 (1960).

         Courses and distances least reliable of calls.
        </b>
        A general rule of construction invoked in the case of repugnant calls in a deed is that courses and distances are the least reliable of all calls, and that a call which designates a point capable of precise and exact location takes precedence over a call for a course and distance if there is a repugnancy between the two. Wallace v. Hirsch, 142 Colo. 264, 350 P.2d 560 (1960).

        Assessment of costs and expenses to losing party.
       </b>
       In an action involving boundary dispute, judgment assessing costs of survey and expenses of commissioners to losing party is in accord with this section. Kelly v. Mullin, 159 Colo. 573, 413 P.2d 186 (1966).

        Assessment of all costs not abuse of discretion.
       </b>
       But the trial court’s assessment of all costs of the action against the defendants was not an abuse of discretion. Brackett v. Cleveland, 147 Colo. 328, 363 P.2d 1050 (1961).

       <b>
        Costs allocated only between original plaintiff and defendant
       </b>
       since the issue of allocating costs to the third-party defendants was not raised in plaintiff’s motion for a new trial and thus the court of appeals had no jurisdiction to decide the issue. Brewster v. Nandrea, 705 P.2d 1 (Colo. 1985).

        Excess or deficiency in land divided among grantees.

       Where a tract of land is subdivided into parts or lots, title to which becomes vested in different persons, none of the grantees are entitled to a preference over the others upon the discovery of an excess of deficiency in the quantity of land contained in the original tract, and the excess or deficiency is then divided among all the lots or parcels in proportion to their areas.

        District court correctly determined location of disputed boundary line.
       </b>
       Here, the parties do not dispute that the pertinent monuments are located consistently with each other. Hence, there is no need to decide whether the rule of the precedence of the monuments has any exception under Colorado law because the only conflict here is between the location of the monuments on the ground and the distance call and the boundary line depiction on the plat. Trial court correctly determined that the monuments controlled the location of the boundary line and they superseded any inconsistent distance call or boundary line referred to or depicted in the subdivision plat.
