       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11a">
         Before the enactment of this title 44, laws administered by the department of revenue that regulate a variety of activities were codified in two titles of the Colorado Revised Statutes, most prominently in title 12, which governs professions and occupations;
        </li>
        <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11b">
         Most professions and occupations are regulated by the department of regulatory agencies pursuant to title 12, but prior to the 2017 legislative session, title 12 contained numerous laws that did not pertain to the regulation of professions and occupations and were not administered by the department of regulatory agencies;
        </li>
        <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11c">
         With the enactment of section 2-3-510 in 2016, the general assembly directed the office of legislative legal services to study an organizational recodification of title 12 of the Colorado Revised Statutes, including relocating laws that do not pertain to professions and occupations and are not administered by the department of regulatory agencies;
        </li>
        <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11d">
         Based on recommendations from the title 12 recodification study, the general assembly enacted several bills in the 2017 legislative session to relocate out of title 12 many laws that are administered by entities other than the department of regulatory agencies;
        </li>
        <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11e">
         The study also recommended creating a new title 44 for purposes of consolidating laws administered by the department of revenue that regulate activities into a single title in order to facilitate both:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11eI">
           The public’s and regulated entities’ understanding of the laws that apply to them; and
          </li>
          <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11eII">
           The department of revenue’s administration of these laws; and

         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t44a01s44-1-102ol11f">
         Creating a new title 44 consisting of laws administered by the department of revenue that regulate various activities is necessary to implement the recommendations of the title 12 recodification study and facilitate the reorganization of title 12 pertaining to the regulation of professions and occupations.

        Exercise of police power.
       </b>
       The state liquor code is deemed an exercise of the police power and a vested interest on the ground of conditions once obtained cannot be asserted against the proper exercise of this power. City and County of Denver v. People, 103 Colo. 565, 88 P.2d 89, appeal dismissed, 307 U.S. 615, 59 S. Ct. 1044, 83 L. Ed. 1496 (1939).

      <p>
       Statutes dealing with the liquor industry are founded on public policy and constitute an exercise of the police powers of the state. Spero v. Bd. of Trustees, 35 Colo. App. 64, 529 P.2d 327 (1974).

        Purpose.
       </b>
       The purpose of this article is the “protection of the economic and social welfare, the health and peace and morals”, of any given locality in the state. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       The aim, intent, and primary purpose of the people in the adoption of art. XXII, Colo. Const., and of the general assembly in the passage of this article, was to completely outlaw and eradicate the old-time public saloon or barroom with its well-known obnoxious characteristics, vices, and effects, and at the same time to authorize, under proper regulations and safeguards, the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquors in bona fide restaurants and hotels. City and County of Denver v. Gushurst, 120 Colo. 465, 210 P.2d 616 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary purpose of the liquor laws of this state is to authorize the sale and consumption of intoxicating beverages while simultaneously protecting the public’s health, safety, and welfare. New Safari Lounge, Inc. v. City of Colo. Springs, 193 Colo. 428, 567 P.2d 372 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The liquor code was enacted to control the manufacture, distribution, and sale of liquor for the protection of the economic and social welfare and health, peace, and morals of the people of Colorado. Squire Restaurant and Lounge v. Denver, 890 P.2d 164 (Colo. App. 1994).

        Applicability of liquor code.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        State declares public policy.
       </b>
       The public policy of the state concerning intoxicating liquor is for the law-making power to declare, and a municipality has no such power. City of Colo. Springs v. Graham, 143 Colo. 97, 352 P.2d 273 (1960).

        Which includes issuance of hotel and restaurant licenses.

       The general assembly of the state of Colorado has authorized the issuance of hotel and restaurant liquor licenses throughout the state, therefore, the public policy has thus been determined. Farmer v. City Council, 153 Colo. 306, 385 P.2d 596 (1963).

      <p>
       Mere privilege exercised under license.
       
       It is settled doctrine that the right to sell intoxicating liquors depends upon strict compliance of the vendor with the requirements of the laws in force in the community where the sale is proposed, and no absolute right to engage in the traffic has ever been admitted in this state, and it is and always has been a mere privilege exercised under a license granted by public authority.

       <b>
        No mandate to permit sale.
       </b>
       Where petitioner contended that the liquor code is a mandate to permit the sale of liquor except in local option territory, the court said that it did not so construe it, because it makes the sale of liquor lawful, “subject to the terms, conditions, limitations, and restrictions contained in this article”. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Though not technically property, a liquor license is a valuable right and possesses some of the characteristics of property,
       </b>
       and it may be revoked for breach of the conditions upon which it was issued. A. D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Parsons, 136 Colo. 434, 319 P.2d 480 (1957).

       <b>
        Objection based on abhorrence of alcohol not considered.
       </b>
       The general assembly decreed that the business of manufacturing, distributing, and selling of liquor is lawful when supervised and controlled as provided by law, hence, the supreme court cannot consider objections to a license rooted solely in basic abhorrence of alcoholic beverages in any form, at any place, at any time. Ladd v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 146 Colo. 366, 361 P.2d 627 (1961).

       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Definition of words “sell” or “sale”,
       </b>
       in subsection (24), must be considered in light of the purpose underlying this article. Contemporary Enters., Inc. v. Charnes, 44 Colo. App. 26, 613 P.2d 339 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Words “distinct” and “definite”
       </b>
       in subsection (15) should be given their ordinary and generally accepted meanings. Denial of request for modification, where premises would still be distinct and definite as those terms are ordinarily defined, is arbitrary and capricious. East 40th Corp. v. City of Aurora, 746 P.2d 55 (Colo. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The operation of shuffleboards for gain or profit constitutes a business within the meaning of subsection (21)
       </b>
       and is prohibited by law in restaurants where liquor is sold with meals. City and County of Denver v. Gushurst, 120 Colo. 465, 210 P.2d 616 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The playing of the game of shuffleboard does not come within the exceptions in subsection (21) and cannot be considered as an ancillary or auxiliary activity in aid of the main business of serving meals, but on the contrary is a separate and distinct business wholly incompatible with the type of restaurant defined in that subsection. City and County of Denver v. Gushurst, 120 Colo. 465, 210 P.2d 616 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The presence and operation of a “Chicago Coin Pistol” machine constitutes a separate and distinct business and is prohibited in restaurants
       </b>
       which are licensed to sell intoxicating liquor by the drink. MacArthur v. Wyscaver, 120 Colo. 525, 211 P.2d 556 (1949); City and County of Denver v. Gushurst, 120 Colo. 465, 210 P.2d 616 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Pizza Hut outlets are restaurants and not stores
       </b>
       or mercantile establishments. Pizza Hut, Inc. v. Dolan, 619 P.2d 508 (Colo. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sale of cigarettes, mints, and salad dressings does not exclude Pizza Hut outlets from the category of restaurants. Pizza Hut, Inc. v. Dolan, 619 P.2d 508 (Colo. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sale of “charge-a-drink” cards did not constitute sale of liquor under article.
       </b>
       The activities of a company which sold “charge-a-drink” cards which entitled the holder to obtain, without charge, one drink worth up to $2 at each of 40 restaurants and lounges did not constitute the sale of liquor under the terms of this article. Contemporary Enters., Inc. v. Charnes, 44 Colo. App. 26, 613 P.2d 339 (1980).

       Department may revoke a license upon a violation of this article or a rule promulgated under this article. This article is silent concerning when the proceedings must be completed; therefore, the state licensing authority has jurisdiction to revoke a license so long as the violation occurs before the license expires.

       The denial of a license to dispense 3.2 beer to a kennel club on the ground that the reasonable requirements of a neighborhood do not warrant issuance thereof is not supported by evidence where the neighborhood is not supplied at all and that there are no such outlets within a radius of five miles, and is arbitrary and capricious.

        Authority granted to director to define criminal conduct is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.
       </b>
       Although the general assembly may not delegate to an administrative agency the power to define criminal conduct, it may authorize the agency to adopt rules carrying criminal sanctions as long as the statutory scheme provides sufficient standards and safeguards to protect against the unreasonable exercise of discretionary power and offers adequate notice of the penalties applicable to a violator.

      <p>
       Enabling legislation which charges the director to adopt rules and regulations not only with respect to the sale of alcoholic beverages in licensed taverns but also in relation to practices unduly designed to increase the consumption of alcoholic beverages provides sufficient standards and safeguards to protect the public against the unreasonable exercise of the director’s power. Prohibiting the service of alcoholic beverages to intoxicated persons and the performance of certain live entertainment are therefore constitutional and not an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority.

       Where record does not reflect that reasonable requirements of neighborhood are not being adequately served by existing 3.2 percent beer outlets, one of which is to be found within distance of one city block from premises of applicant and another within two or three blocks east of applicant’s store, denial of application by licensing authority under such circumstances was neither arbitrary nor capricious.

       While the section permits removal to another location of a hotel or restaurant license upon a proper showing, a contract by which the parties agree that the licensee will not exercise this privilege, but upon termination of the tenancy will surrender the license to the licensing authority, is not in violation of the law since it is not an agreement for the transfer of the license.

       Where prior to condemnation by the state for highway purposes, there were two successful outlets in Silver Plume; that because of the condemnation proceedings there were none at the time of the application; that the nearest such outlet was two and one-half miles away; that 34 residents indicated the need for such an outlet; and where after denial of the application, but prior to the district court’s review thereof, the trustees issued a similar license to a nearby establishment, the evidence constitutes a prima facie showing of need for the license. Booth v. Trustees of Town of Silver Plume, 28 Colo. App. 470, 474 P.2d 227 (1970).

         Ninety days before the expiration date of an existing license, the state licensing authority shall notify the licensee of the expiration date by any method reasonably likely to actually notify the licensee.

         For the renewal of an existing license, the licensee must apply to the local licensing authority not less than forty-five days and to the state licensing authority not less than thirty days before the date of expiration. The local licensing authority shall not accept an application for renewal of a license after the date of expiration, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. Filing with the local licensing authority is deemed filing with the state licensing authority. The state licensing authority shall process all renewal applications that are filed with the local licensing authorities before the expiration date and subsequently approved and shall extend the expiration date until the state license application process is completed.

         Delegation of legislative authority
        </b>
        to the Department of Excise and Licenses to adopt rules and conduct hearings on applications to renew liquor licenses is not unconstitutional on the basis that the statute fails to provide sufficient standards for defining “good cause”.

         Statutory licensing guide.
        </b>
        The licensing authority is by statute charged with the duty and task of determining whether a license should be granted or denied, and the statutory guide provided for the board in performing this duty is found in this section. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Supreme court decisions.
        </b>
        Another source of guidance for the board in performing its duties as a licensing authority is the numerous pronouncements of the supreme court. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Three principles pervade all of the pertinent decisions:
        </b>
        (1) The licensing authorities are vested with a very wide discretion; (2) all reasonable doubts as to the correctness of the board’s rulings are to be resolved in favor of the board; (3) the determination of the board will not be disturbed by the courts unless it appears that the board has abused its discretion. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        The issuance of licenses under the liquor code depends in the final analysis on the judgment of the licensing authority and not upon that of citizens or the court; and all reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the licensing authority. Kornfeld v. Yost, 37 Colo. App. 483, 551 P.2d 219 (1976), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Kornfeld v. Perl Mack Liquors, Inc., 193 Colo. 442, 567 P.2d 383 (1977).

         It was the intention of the general assembly to vest a wide discretion in local licensing authorities

        in the issuance of licenses for sale of alcoholic beverages. Gem Beverage Co. v. Geer, 138 Colo. 420, 334 P.2d 744 (1959).

       <p>
        <b>
         Governed by facts and circumstances.
        </b>
        While a wide discretion is vested in the county commissioners with respect to the issuance of liquor licenses, the exercise of that discretion must be governed by a proper consideration of the facts and circumstances in each case. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Buckley, 121 Colo. 108, 213 P.2d 608 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The exercise of this discretion cannot be dispensed with by the adoption of a policy to deny all applications.

        <b>
         No contrary local policy authorized.
        </b>
        The wide discretion which is vested in the licensing authority in granting or denying licenses is not to be construed as authority to establish a local public policy either by express resolution or by secret agreement contrary to the state statutes which have legalized the issuance of this particular type of license.

         Local authority to license, not to regulate.
        </b>
        The board of county commissioners has no authority to regulate the sale of malt and vinous liquors, other than 3.2 percent beer, but only to grant, suspend, or revoke licenses as provided by this section. Gettman v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 122 Colo. 185, 221 P.2d 363 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A resolution of a city council limiting the number of liquor licenses on the basis of citywide population is invalid
        </b>
        as tantamount to a prejudgment of any application. This article requires a hearing and issuance or denial of a license on the merits of each application. City of Colo. Springs v. Graham, 143 Colo. 97, 352 P.2d 273 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No authority to regulate hours.
        </b>
        This section makes no attempt to delegate to the board of county commissioners any authority of regulation as to hours when malt or vinous liquors may be sold or the authority to promulgate other rules and regulations. Gettman v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 122 Colo. 185, 221 P.2d 363 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Personal right vested in licensee.
        </b>
        A liquor license vests a personal right in the licensee and confers the right to do that which without the license would be unlawful, such right being coextensive with the duration of the license and is restricted to a certain location, unless change thereof is granted upon application to, and after a hearing by, the licensing authority. A. D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Parsons, 136 Colo. 434, 319 P.2d 480 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Liquor license is a property right entitled to due process protection including notice and an opportunity to be heard
        </b>
        and, therefore, due process was denied when claimant for liquor license renewal was not notified that evidence would be taken on the needs and desires of the neighborhood. Price Haskel v. Denver Dept. of Excise &amp; Licenses, 694 P.2d 364 (Colo. App. 1984).

         This section permits removal to another location of a hotel and restaurant license upon a proper showing.

        A. D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Parsons, 136 Colo. 434, 319 P.2d 480 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the section permits removal to another location of a hotel or restaurant license upon a proper showing, a contract by which the parties agree that the licensee will not exercise this privilege, but upon termination of the tenancy will surrender the license to the licensing authority, is not in violation of the law since it is not an agreement for the transfer of the license. A. D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Parsons, 136 Colo. 434, 319 P.2d 480 (1957).

         Full, fair, and impartial hearing.
        </b>
        Where an applicant was given full opportunity to present all testimony and documentary evidence it desired, and availed itself of such opportunity, the fact that the chairman of the board of county commissioners at beginning of hearing expressed the opinion that needs of the neighborhood were presently met falls short of denial to applicant of a full, fair, and impartial hearing. Lab Dev. Co. v. Hill, 152 Colo. 338, 381 P.2d 811 (1963).

         No court may substitute its judgment for that of the local licensing authority

        <b>
         Denial upheld where not arbitrary or capricious.

        While not supported by a preponderance, the denial of a retail license will be upheld if supported by sufficient evidence, if the licensing authority did not act arbitrarily and capriciously. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Thompson, 167 Colo. 402, 448 P.2d 639 (1968).

         “Good cause” standard fails to give sufficient notice.
        </b>
        Standard in liquor code of “good cause” as the criterion for determining if a liquor license is renewed, without any implementing rules, fails to give sufficient definiteness of what conduct and conditions are required to avoid nonrenewal, fails to insure rational and consistent administrative action and effective subsequent judicial review of that action, and therefore violates due process. Some limit must be provided by the Department of Excise and Licenses to guide discretion in determining if “good cause” for refusing to renew a liquor license exists. Squire Restaurant &amp; Lounge v. Denver, 890 P.2d 164 (Colo. App. 1994) (decided under former law).
       </p>

        An example of refusal for good cause is where the board of county commissioners refused to grant a liquor license to an operator of a rural hotel and based its decision on the fact that the premises could be reached only by a dangerous, winding country road in a mountainous area and also on the ground of the proximity of young people at a nearby college, it was held not to be an abuse of discretion. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Buckley, 121 Colo. 108, 213 P.2d 608 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The right of a licensing authority to refuse for good cause, of necessity vests in the board of county commissioners
        </b>
        in any county in the first instance the right to determine what is good cause for refusal. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936); Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Buckley, 121 Colo. 108, 213 P.2d 608 (1949).

         Prior license action not binding.
        </b>
        The board is not bound by any prior action of any licensing authority with relation to the facts pertaining to the issuance of any license for former years, but is called upon to exercise its own discretion as of the date of a new application. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conceivably, the licensing authority passing upon a new application, in the exercise of its discretion, might with propriety reject an application which a former board, upon the same facts, approved, and in so doing the board would not, of necessity, be guilty of an abuse of discretion, or an arbitrary and capricious exercise thereof. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958); Cronin v. Ward, 144 Colo. 192, 355 P.2d 655 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        That a licensing officer had previously denied the application to another to operate an establishment at the same premises does not preclude the issuance of a license to an applicant who in his judgment and discretion is qualified therefor.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Applications are considered and determined upon a geographical basis, a neighborhood,
        </b>
        and not upon a citywide population basis. City of Colo. Springs v. Graham, 143 Colo. 97, 352 P.2d 273 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Determined by city council.
        </b>
        The members of a city council, as the local licensing authority, knowing the area which they represent and the problems confronting it, are better able to consider what should constitute the “neighborhood” after considering all of the evidence presented to it than is the supreme court. Campbell v. City Council, 150 Colo. 471, 374 P.2d 348 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The geographic extent of the neighborhood will vary from case to case.
        </b>
        Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Johnson, 170 Colo. 259, 460 P.2d 770 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Never entire county.
        </b>
        No authority justifies the conclusion that the “neighborhood” involved in an application for a liquor license can be expanded to include an entire county. Bolton v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 164 Colo. 112, 432 P.2d 761 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Boundary lines of a city do not exclude residents on one side or the other from the “neighborhood”
        </b>
        to be considered in connection with applications for liquor licenses. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bickel, 155 Colo. 465, 395 P.2d 208 (1964); Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence or nonexistence of outlets on either side of a city boundary are to be considered by the licensing authority in determining whether reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are being met. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bickel, 155 Colo. 465, 395 P.2d 208 (1964); Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The fact that a particular type of license is not authorized in the neighborhood does not require the issuance
        </b>
        of such a license if, in fact, the needs of the neighborhood, with respect to the type of beverage authorized to be sold by the license requested, are being met by existing licenses. Canjar v. Huerta, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The licensing of so-called “fringe stores” is not a matter that in and of itself is a bar to the issuance of licenses,
        </b>
        but is merely a circumstance to which the board is entitled to give such reasonable weight as it shall determine. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Applicant’s showing of neighborhood.
        </b>
        It is incumbent upon an applicant for a liquor license to show with some degree of clarity the area of the neighborhood requiring the service proposed to be rendered. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test under subsection (2) is still the “desires of the inhabitants” and “the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood”. Tavella v. Eppinger, 152 Colo. 506, 383 P.2d 314 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Before a liquor license can be issued under subsection (2), two requirements must be affirmatively established:
        </b>
        1. that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are not being met by existing outlets, and 2. that the inhabitants of the neighborhood desire its issuance. Heinz v. Bauer, 150 Colo. 589, 375 P.2d 520 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The licensing authority must determine both the reasonable requirements of a neighborhood and the desires of its inhabitants. Canjar v. Huerta, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Unless both requirements are met no license may issue.
        </b>
        Heinz v. Bauer, 150 Colo. 589, 375 P.2d 520 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Establishing these two requirements is the statutory responsibility of the board.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Showing of inadequate service required.
        </b>
        An applicant is entitled to a license only on proof that the neighborhood sought to be served is not adequately served by the other licensed outlets. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not relieve applicants of the duty to prove a reasonable requirement for the proposed outlet, an essential prerequisite to the granting of a license. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there are a number of licensed outlets in an area, an applicant for an additional liquor license has the burden to establish by competent evidence that the needs of the community are not being adequately met by existing outlets. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Evergreen Lanes, Inc., 154 Colo. 413, 391 P.2d 372 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of proof of the fact that the neighborhood is not adequately served precludes the issuance of a license. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Economic competition considered.
        </b>
        Whether any benefit will result to the public from competition in the sale of intoxicating liquor in a particular area, is a matter which the licensing authority may consider in determining the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood and the desires of the inhabitants, the weight to be accorded such matter being within the sound discretion of the authority. Lab Dev. Co. v. Hill, 152 Colo. 338, 381 P.2d 811 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The weight to be accorded to such matters as whether any benefit will result to the public from economic competition lies within the sound discretion of the board of county supervisors. Lab Dev. Co. v. Hill, 152 Colo. 338, 381 P.2d 811 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Number and proximity of other outlets considered.
        </b>
        Besides considering the number of outlets in the area, the board of county commissioners may properly take into account in its consideration of the case the fact that close to the location for which a license is sought there are existing outlets to serve the public. Jennings v. Hoskinson, 152 Colo. 276, 382 P.2d 807 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The existence of a desire for a new outlet is some evidence that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood were not being met.
        </b>
        Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>

        <b>
         Regardless of their reasons, the desires of the inhabitants are to be considered.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where protests were based on the general policy that liquor is evil, and secondly that there was a package store nearby,
        </b>
        such protests were not relevant and should not have been considered since the application was for liquor by the drink, and since there was no competent evidence before the board to negate the affirmative showing by the applicant, and the board arbitrarily restricted the neighborhood, the license should have been granted. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Johnson, 170 Colo. 259, 460 P.2d 770 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Consideration of proof unlimited.
        </b>
        This section in no way limits the board in giving proper consideration to other proof of the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood or the desires of the inhabitants thereof. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Effect of petitions and remonstrances of inhabitants.
        </b>
        While the expression of opinions as to the requirements of the neighborhood and the needs of the inhabitants thereof, contained in petitions and remonstrances, are entitled to consideration, they are not controlling since this section requires that the issuance of licenses shall depend on the judgment of the licensing authority and not on that of citizens or the court. MacArthur v. Presto, 122 Colo. 202, 221 P.2d 934 (1950); MacArthur v. Sanzalone, 123 Colo. 166, 225 P.2d 1044 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute precludes the board from granting a license until it has given good-faith consideration to inhabitants’ petitions and remonstrances. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Geographical distinctions within a neighborhood do not determine the efficacy of petitions or remonstrances in liquor licensing cases. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a greater number of inhabitants had signed petitions favoring issuance of the license does not of itself mandate issuance thereof. Kornfeld v. Yost, 37 Colo. App. 483, 551 P.2d 219 (1976), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Kornfeld v. Perl Mack Liquors, Inc., 193 Colo. 442, 567 P.2d 383 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where remonstrances against the granting of a beverage license are signed by others than those resident in a defined neighborhood of a licensee’s outlet,
        </b>
        and its issuance is supported by several hundred persons resident in the immediate neighborhood, the petitions supporting the application are sufficient to justify its issuance, and there being nothing to indicate that a city council acted arbitrarily or capriciously in granting a license, the courts will not interfere. Hanna v. Henderson, 140 Colo. 481, 345 P.2d 384 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Votes in local option election.
        </b>
        The desires of the citizens “otherwise” expressed by their votes in a local option election is likewise admissible evidence to be considered in ascertaining the “desires of the inhabitants”, and given such weight as the board of commissioners deemed proper under this section. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).
       </p>

        <b>
         Needs of traveling public.
        </b>
        In determining the reasonable requirements of neighborhood upon application for a restaurant liquor license, evidence of the reasonable need of the traveling public and transients is valid to show such need and demand. Campbell v. City Council, 150 Colo. 471, 374 P.2d 348 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Showing of inadequate service sufficient.
        </b>
        Where the record discloses that there are no restaurant liquor licenses in the city, and no such license in the entire county, the nearest outlet of the kind being 50 miles distant, it cannot be said that the reasonable requirements of the area have been met. Farmer v. City Council, 153 Colo. 306, 385 P.2d 596 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is a substantial showing that a liquor outlet is desired in a community, it cannot be said that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are being served when it appears that the nearest outlet of the kind sought is 12 or 13 miles distant from the location requested. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Whale, 154 Colo. 271, 389 P.2d 588 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the only licenses presently existing in a city are for private clubs and package liquor stores, and more favor than disfavor the license in the immediate neighborhood, there is no basis upon which the application of plaintiff may legally be denied since there are no licenses of the type sought within a five mile radius. Le Pore v. Larkin, 146 Colo. 311, 361 P.2d 343 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the general assembly has authorized the issuance of hotel and restaurant liquor licenses throughout the state, thus determining the public policy, and where the evidence disclosed that no such license had ever been issued in city of size and population disclosed by the record, and substantial support for the issuance of such license is shown, it cannot be said that reasonable requirements of the area have been met. KBT Corp. v. Walker, 148 Colo. 274, 365 P.2d 685 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Denial arbitrary and capricious.
        </b>
        Where there is no liquor outlet of a given classification within a radius of several miles, the refusal to grant such a license is arbitrary and capricious where substantial support for the issuance thereof is shown. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bickel, 155 Colo. 465, 395 P.2d 208 (1964); Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Johnson, 170 Colo. 259, 460 P.2d 770 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an application for a hotel and restaurant liquor license was denied and evidence disclosed that there was no such outlet within a radius of 35 miles of city, the determination of city council that the neighborhood was adequately supplied by existing outlets was arbitrary and capricious. KBT Corp. v. Walker, 148 Colo. 274, 365 P.2d 685 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Showing of inadequate service insufficient.
        </b>
        Where there are a number of licensed outlets in an area in which a restaurant license is sought, evidence that many residents of the neighborhood desired to dine at applicants’ restaurant and desired to be served liquor with their meals, does not alone establish that existing outlets were inadequate to satisfy the desires of the inhabitants and the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bova, 153 Colo. 230, 385 P.2d 590 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The finding of the trial court that the applicant plans to provide a general recreation facility and that such facility is unlike any presently existing in the area, and this is fully borne out by the evidence and is undisputed, does not evidence the fact that the neighborhood in question requires another liquor outlet, especially where the undisputed evidence is that the proposed development will proceed whether or not a liquor license is granted. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Evergreen Lanes, Inc., 154 Colo. 413, 391 P.2d 372 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though the applicant proved the majority of those interested desired the license to issue, and it undoubtedly would be a convenience to have such a store within the shopping center where there is more adequate parking and one stop service, nevertheless it is also true that the physical facts could, and in the judgment of the authority did, show that the present reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are being met. Brentwood Liquors, Inc. v. Schooley, 147 Colo. 324, 363 P.2d 670 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Denial not capricious or arbitrary.
        </b>
        Where even though the desire of the neighborhood was that the license should issue, nonetheless the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood were adequately met by the existing outlets, in particular a liquor store next door to the applicant, the city council in so finding did not act arbitrarily or capriciously, but well within the limits of its discretionary power. McIntosh v. Council of City of Littleton, 145 Colo. 533, 360 P.2d 136 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence in the record showed the existence of many licensed restaurants and liquor stores in the vicinity, this was potent evidence to support the finding that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood had been met and that the denial of a license was not capricious or arbitrary. MacArthur v. Presto, 122 Colo. 202, 221 P.2d 934 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence disclosed three existing hotel and restaurant liquor licenses in an area designated as a neighborhood and others in close proximity thereto, a finding by the licensing authority of lack of need for issuance of license applied for, based upon a fair appraisal of the evidence, cannot be held to be arbitrary. Schooley v. Steinberg, 148 Colo. 222, 365 P.2d 245 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record disclosed two package liquor outlets and two establishments serving liquor by the drink within half to three quarters of a mile of applicant’s location, denial of a package liquor license by board of county commissioners was not arbitrary or capricious. Malouff v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 150 Colo. 11, 370 P.2d 161 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the board of commissioners did not refuse to receive any evidence offered, and the evidence showed the location of the proposed dispensary to be in close proximity to state college, and where the board had before it protests admitted to have been made by many of the officials of the college and of the public schools, as well as petitions signed by citizens, the court could not say that the board acted arbitrarily or capriciously in refusing a license when such action was based on evidence from which reasonable men might honestly draw different conclusions. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).

        Where prior to condemnation by the state for highway purposes, there were two successful outlets in Silver Plume; that because of the condemnation proceedings there were none at the time of the application; that the nearest such outlet was two and one-half miles away; that 34 residents indicated the need for such an outlet; and where after denial of the application, but prior to the district court’s review thereof, the trustees issued a similar license to a nearby establishment, the evidence constitutes a prima facie showing of need for the license.

       </p>

        <b>
         Delegation of legislative authority
        </b>
        to the Department of Excise and Licenses to adopt rules and conduct hearings on applications to renew liquor licenses is not unconstitutional on the basis that the statute fails to provide sufficient standards for defining “good cause”. Squire Restaurant and Lounge v. Denver, 890 P.2d 164 (Colo. App. 1994).

       <p>
        <b>
         Statutory licensing guide.
        </b>
        The licensing authority is by statute charged with the duty and task of determining whether a license should be granted or denied, and the statutory guide provided for the board in performing this duty is found in this section. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Supreme court decisions.
        </b>
        Another source of guidance for the board in performing its duties as a licensing authority is the numerous pronouncements of the supreme court. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Three principles pervade all of the pertinent decisions:
        </b>
        (1) The licensing authorities are vested with a very wide discretion; (2) all reasonable doubts as to the correctness of the board’s rulings are to be resolved in favor of the board; (3) the determination of the board will not be disturbed by the courts unless it appears that the board has abused its discretion. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        The issuance of licenses under the liquor code depends in the final analysis on the judgment of the licensing authority and not upon that of citizens or the court; and all reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the licensing authority. Kornfeld v. Yost, 37 Colo. App. 483, 551 P.2d 219 (1976), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Kornfeld v. Perl Mack Liquors, Inc., 193 Colo. 442, 567 P.2d 383 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         It was the intention of the general assembly to vest a wide discretion in local licensing authorities
        </b>
        in the issuance of licenses for sale of alcoholic beverages. Gem Beverage Co. v. Geer, 138 Colo. 420, 334 P.2d 744 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Governed by facts and circumstances.
        </b>
        While a wide discretion is vested in the county commissioners with respect to the issuance of liquor licenses, the exercise of that discretion must be governed by a proper consideration of the facts and circumstances in each case. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Buckley, 121 Colo. 108, 213 P.2d 608 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The exercise of this discretion cannot be dispensed with by the adoption of a policy to deny all applications.
        </b>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The general assembly has established the public policy for the entire state,
        </b>
        and this cannot be overridden by local governments by mere fiat nor ignored by the courts. Le Pore v. Larkin, 146 Colo. 311, 361 P.2d 343 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No contrary local policy authorized.
        </b>
        The wide discretion which is vested in the licensing authority in granting or denying licenses is not to be construed as authority to establish a local public policy either by express resolution or by secret agreement contrary to the state statutes which have legalized the issuance of this particular type of license. Ladd v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 146 Colo. 366, 361 P.2d 627 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Licensing procedures must not be used as a means of establishing local option

        and circumventing statutory requirements. Le Pore v. Larkin, 146 Colo. 311, 361 P.2d 343 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Local authority to license, not to regulate.
        </b>
        The board of county commissioners has no authority to regulate the sale of malt and vinous liquors, other than 3.2 percent beer, but only to grant, suspend, or revoke licenses as provided by this section. Gettman v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 122 Colo. 185, 221 P.2d 363 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A resolution of a city council limiting the number of liquor licenses on the basis of citywide population is invalid
        </b>
        as tantamount to a prejudgment of any application. This article requires a hearing and issuance or denial of a license on the merits of each application. City of Colo. Springs v. Graham, 143 Colo. 97, 352 P.2d 273 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No authority to regulate hours.
        </b>
        This section makes no attempt to delegate to the board of county commissioners any authority of regulation as to hours when malt or vinous liquors may be sold or the authority to promulgate other rules and regulations. Gettman v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 122 Colo. 185, 221 P.2d 363 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Personal right vested in licensee.
        </b>
        A liquor license vests a personal right in the licensee and confers the right to do that which without the license would be unlawful, such right being coextensive with the duration of the license and is restricted to a certain location, unless change thereof is granted upon application to, and after a hearing by, the licensing authority. A. D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Parsons, 136 Colo. 434, 319 P.2d 480 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Liquor license is a property right entitled to due process protection including notice and an opportunity to be heard
        </b>
        and, therefore, due process was denied when claimant for liquor license renewal was not notified that evidence would be taken on the needs and desires of the neighborhood. Price Haskel v. Denver Dept. of Excise &amp; Licenses, 694 P.2d 364 (Colo. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         This section permits removal to another location of a hotel and restaurant license upon a proper showing.
        </b>
        A. D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Parsons, 136 Colo. 434, 319 P.2d 480 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the section permits removal to another location of a hotel or restaurant license upon a proper showing, a contract by which the parties agree that the licensee will not exercise this privilege, but upon termination of the tenancy will surrender the license to the licensing authority, is not in violation of the law since it is not an agreement for the transfer of the license. A. D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Parsons, 136 Colo. 434, 319 P.2d 480 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Full, fair, and impartial hearing.
        </b>
        Where an applicant was given full opportunity to present all testimony and documentary evidence it desired, and availed itself of such opportunity, the fact that the chairman of the board of county commissioners at beginning of hearing expressed the opinion that needs of the neighborhood were presently met falls short of denial to applicant of a full, fair, and impartial hearing. Lab Dev. Co. v. Hill, 152 Colo. 338, 381 P.2d 811 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No court may substitute its judgment for that of the local licensing authority
        </b>
        when there is any evidence in the record that supports the conclusion of the licensing authority. Canjar v. Huerta, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977); Duren, Inc. v. City of Lakewood, 709 P.2d 74 (Colo. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Denial upheld where not arbitrary or capricious.
        </b>
        While not supported by a preponderance, the denial of a retail license will be upheld if supported by sufficient evidence, if the licensing authority did not act arbitrarily and capriciously. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Thompson, 167 Colo. 402, 448 P.2d 639 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         “Good cause” standard fails to give sufficient notice.
        </b>
        Standard in liquor code of “good cause” as the criterion for determining if a liquor license is renewed, without any implementing rules, fails to give sufficient definiteness of what conduct and conditions are required to avoid nonrenewal, fails to insure rational and consistent administrative action and effective subsequent judicial review of that action, and therefore violates due process. Some limit must be provided by the Department of Excise and Licenses to guide discretion in determining if “good cause” for refusing to renew a liquor license exists. Squire Restaurant and Lounge v. Denver, 890 P.2d 164 (Colo. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Abuse of discretion.
        </b>
        An example of refusal for good cause is where the board of county commissioners refused to grant a liquor license to an operator of a rural hotel and based its decision on the fact that the premises could be reached only by a dangerous, winding country road in a mountainous area and also on the ground of the proximity of young people at a nearby college, it was held not to be an abuse of discretion. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Buckley, 121 Colo. 108, 213 P.2d 608 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The right of a licensing authority to refuse for good cause, of necessity vests in the board of county commissioners
        </b>
        in any county in the first instance the right to determine what is good cause for refusal. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936); Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Buckley, 121 Colo. 108, 213 P.2d 608 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Prior license action not binding.
        </b>
        The board is not bound by any prior action of any licensing authority with relation to the facts pertaining to the issuance of any license for former years, but is called upon to exercise its own discretion as of the date of a new application. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conceivably, the licensing authority passing upon a new application, in the exercise of its discretion, might with propriety reject an application which a former board, upon the same facts, approved, and in so doing the board would not, of necessity, be guilty of an abuse of discretion, or an arbitrary and capricious exercise thereof. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958); Cronin v. Ward, 144 Colo. 192, 355 P.2d 655 (1960).
       </p>

        That a licensing officer had previously denied the application to another to operate an establishment at the same premises does not preclude the issuance of a license to an applicant who in his judgment and discretion is qualified therefor.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Applications are considered and determined upon a geographical basis, a neighborhood,
        </b>
        and not upon a citywide population basis. City of Colo. Springs v. Graham, 143 Colo. 97, 352 P.2d 273 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Determined by city council.
        </b>
        The members of a city council, as the local licensing authority, knowing the area which they represent and the problems confronting it, are better able to consider what should constitute the “neighborhood” after considering all of the evidence presented to it than is the supreme court. Campbell v. City Council, 150 Colo. 471, 374 P.2d 348 (1962).
       </p>

        <b>
         The geographic extent of the neighborhood will vary from case to case.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Never entire county.
        </b>
        No authority justifies the conclusion that the “neighborhood” involved in an application for a liquor license can be expanded to include an entire county. Bolton v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 164 Colo. 112, 432 P.2d 761 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Boundary lines of a city do not exclude residents on one side or the other from the “neighborhood”
        </b>
        to be considered in connection with applications for liquor licenses. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bickel, 155 Colo. 465, 395 P.2d 208 (1964); Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence or nonexistence of outlets on either side of a city boundary are to be considered by the licensing authority in determining whether reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are being met. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bickel, 155 Colo. 465, 395 P.2d 208 (1964); Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The fact that a particular type of license is not authorized in the neighborhood does not require the issuance
        </b>
        of such a license if, in fact, the needs of the neighborhood, with respect to the type of beverage authorized to be sold by the license requested, are being met by existing licenses. Canjar v. Huerta, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The licensing of so-called “fringe stores” is not a matter that in and of itself is a bar to the issuance of licenses,
        </b>
        but is merely a circumstance to which the board is entitled to give such reasonable weight as it shall determine. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Applicant’s showing of neighborhood.
        </b>
        It is incumbent upon an applicant for a liquor license to show with some degree of clarity the area of the neighborhood requiring the service proposed to be rendered. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test under subsection (2) is still the “desires of the inhabitants” and “the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood”. Tavella v. Eppinger, 152 Colo. 506, 383 P.2d 314 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Before a liquor license can be issued under subsection (2), two requirements must be affirmatively established:
        </b>
        1. that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are not being met by existing outlets, and 2. that the inhabitants of the neighborhood desire its issuance. Heinz v. Bauer, 150 Colo. 589, 375 P.2d 520 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The licensing authority must determine both the reasonable requirements of a neighborhood and the desires of its inhabitants. Canjar v. Huerta, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Unless both requirements are met, no license may issue.
        </b>
        Heinz v. Bauer, 150 Colo. 589, 375 P.2d 520 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Establishing these two requirements is the statutory responsibility of the board.
        </b>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Showing of inadequate service required.
        </b>
        An applicant is entitled to a license only on proof that the neighborhood sought to be served is not adequately served by the other licensed outlets. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 138 Colo. 66, 329 P.2d 629 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not relieve applicants of the duty to prove a reasonable requirement for the proposed outlet, an essential prerequisite to the granting of a license. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there are a number of licensed outlets in an area, an applicant for an additional liquor license has the burden to establish by competent evidence that the needs of the community are not being adequately met by existing outlets. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Evergreen Lanes, Inc., 154 Colo. 413, 391 P.2d 372 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of proof of the fact that the neighborhood is not adequately served precludes the issuance of a license. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Economic competition considered.
        </b>
        Whether any benefit will result to the public from competition in the sale of intoxicating liquor in a particular area is a matter which the licensing authority may consider in determining the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood and the desires of the inhabitants, the weight to be accorded such matter being within the sound discretion of the authority. Lab Dev. Co. v. Hill, 152 Colo. 338, 381 P.2d 811 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The weight to be accorded to such matters as whether any benefit will result to the public from economic competition lies within the sound discretion of the board of county supervisors. Lab Dev. Co. v. Hill, 152 Colo. 338, 381 P.2d 811 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Number and proximity of other outlets considered.
        </b>
        Besides considering the number of outlets in the area, the board of county commissioners may properly take into account in its consideration of the case the fact that close to the location for which a license is sought there are existing outlets to serve the public. Jennings v. Hoskinson, 152 Colo. 276, 382 P.2d 807 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The existence of a desire for a new outlet is some evidence that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood were not being met.
        </b>
        Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Regardless of their reasons, the desires of the inhabitants are to be considered.
        </b>
        Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where protests were based on the general policy that liquor is evil, and secondly that there was a package store nearby,
        </b>
        such protests were not relevant and should not have been considered since the application was for liquor by the drink, and since there was no competent evidence before the board to negate the affirmative showing by the applicant, and the board arbitrarily restricted the neighborhood, the license should have been granted. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Johnson, 170 Colo. 259, 460 P.2d 770 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Consideration of proof unlimited.
        </b>
        This section in no way limits the board in giving proper consideration to other proof of the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood or the desires of the inhabitants thereof. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Effect of petitions and remonstrances of inhabitants.
        </b>
        While the expression of opinions as to the requirements of the neighborhood and the needs of the inhabitants thereof, contained in petitions and remonstrances, are entitled to consideration, they are not controlling since this section requires that the issuance of licenses shall depend on the judgment of the licensing authority and not on that of citizens or the court. MacArthur v. Presto, 122 Colo. 202, 221 P.2d 934 (1950); MacArthur v. Sanzalone, 123 Colo. 166, 225 P.2d 1044 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute precludes the board from granting a license until it has given good-faith consideration to inhabitants’ petitions and remonstrances. Hauf Brau v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 145 Colo. 522, 359 P.2d 659 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Geographical distinctions within a neighborhood do not determine the efficacy of petitions or remonstrances in liquor licensing cases. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a greater number of inhabitants had signed petitions favoring issuance of the license does not of itself mandate issuance thereof. Kornfeld v. Yost, 37 Colo. App. 483, 551 P.2d 219 (1976), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Kornfeld v. Perl Mack Liquors, Inc., 193 Colo. 442, 567 P.2d 383 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where remonstrances against the granting of a beverage license are signed by others than those resident in a defined neighborhood of a licensee’s outlet,
        </b>
        and its issuance is supported by several hundred persons resident in the immediate neighborhood, the petitions supporting the application are sufficient to justify its issuance, and there being nothing to indicate that a city council acted arbitrarily or capriciously in granting a license, the courts will not interfere. Hanna v. Henderson, 140 Colo. 481, 345 P.2d 384 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Votes in local option election.
        </b>
        The desires of the citizens “otherwise” expressed by their votes in a local option election is likewise admissible evidence to be considered in ascertaining the “desires of the inhabitants”, and given such weight as the board of commissioners deemed proper under this section. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Needs of traveling public.
        </b>
        In determining the reasonable requirements of neighborhood upon application for a restaurant liquor license, evidence of the reasonable need of the traveling public and transients is valid to show such need and demand. Campbell v. City Council, 150 Colo. 471, 374 P.2d 348 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Showing of inadequate service sufficient.
        </b>
        Where the record discloses that there are no restaurant liquor licenses in the city, and no such license in the entire county, the nearest outlet of the kind being 50 miles distant, it cannot be said that the reasonable requirements of the area have been met. Farmer v. City Council, 153 Colo. 306, 385 P.2d 596 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is a substantial showing that a liquor outlet is desired in a community, it cannot be said that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are being served when it appears that the nearest outlet of the kind sought is 12 or 13 miles distant from the location requested. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Whale, 154 Colo. 271, 389 P.2d 588 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the only licenses presently existing in a city are for private clubs and package liquor stores, and more favor than disfavor the license in the immediate neighborhood, there is no basis upon which the application of plaintiff may legally be denied since there are no licenses of the type sought within a five mile radius. Le Pore v. Larkin, 146 Colo. 311, 361 P.2d 343 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the general assembly has authorized the issuance of hotel and restaurant liquor licenses throughout the state, thus determining the public policy, and where the evidence disclosed that no such license had ever been issued in city of size and population disclosed by the record, and substantial support for the issuance of such license is shown, it cannot be said that reasonable requirements of the area have been met. KBT Corp. v. Walker, 148 Colo. 274, 365 P.2d 685 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Denial arbitrary and capricious.
        </b>
        Where there is no liquor outlet of a given classification within a radius of several miles, the refusal to grant such a license is arbitrary and capricious where substantial support for the issuance thereof is shown. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bickel, 155 Colo. 465, 395 P.2d 208 (1964); Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Johnson, 170 Colo. 259, 460 P.2d 770 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an application for a hotel and restaurant liquor license was denied and evidence disclosed that there was no such outlet within a radius of 35 miles of city, the determination of city council that the neighborhood was adequately supplied by existing outlets was arbitrary and capricious. KBT Corp. v. Walker, 148 Colo. 274, 365 P.2d 685 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Showing of inadequate service insufficient.
        </b>
        Where there are a number of licensed outlets in an area in which a restaurant license is sought, evidence that many residents of the neighborhood desired to dine at applicants’ restaurant and desired to be served liquor with their meals did not alone establish that existing outlets were inadequate to satisfy the desires of the inhabitants and the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bova, 153 Colo. 230, 385 P.2d 590 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The finding of the trial court that the applicant plans to provide a general recreation facility and that such facility is unlike any presently existing in the area, and this is fully borne out by the evidence and is undisputed, does not evidence the fact that the neighborhood in question requires another liquor outlet, especially where the undisputed evidence is that the proposed development will proceed whether or not a liquor license is granted. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Evergreen Lanes, Inc., 154 Colo. 413, 391 P.2d 372 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though the applicant proved the majority of those interested desired the license to issue, and it undoubtedly would be a convenience to have such a store within the shopping center where there is more adequate parking and one stop service, nevertheless it is also true that the physical facts could, and in the judgment of the authority did, show that the present reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are being met. Brentwood Liquors, Inc. v. Schooley, 147 Colo. 324, 363 P.2d 670 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Denial not capricious or arbitrary.
        </b>
        Where even though the desire of the neighborhood was that the license should issue, nonetheless the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood were adequately met by the existing outlets, in particular a liquor store next door to the applicant, the city council in so finding did not act arbitrarily or capriciously, but well within the limits of its discretionary power. McIntosh v. Council of City of Littleton, 145 Colo. 533, 360 P.2d 136 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence in the record showed the existence of many licensed restaurants and liquor stores in the vicinity, this was potent evidence to support the finding that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood had been met and that the denial of a license was not capricious or arbitrary. MacArthur v. Presto, 122 Colo. 202, 221 P.2d 934 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence disclosed three existing hotel and restaurant liquor licenses in an area designated as a neighborhood and others in close proximity thereto, a finding by the licensing authority of lack of need for issuance of license applied for, based upon a fair appraisal of the evidence, cannot be held to be arbitrary. Schooley v. Steinberg, 148 Colo. 222, 365 P.2d 245 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record disclosed two package liquor outlets and two establishments serving liquor by the drink within half to three quarters of a mile of applicant’s location, denial of a package liquor license by board of county commissioners was not arbitrary or capricious. Malouff v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 150 Colo. 11, 370 P.2d 161 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the board of commissioners did not refuse to receive any evidence offered, and the evidence showed the location of the proposed dispensary to be in close proximity to a state college, and where the board had before it protests admitted to have been made by many of the officials of the college and of the public schools, as well as petitions signed by citizens, the court could not say that the board acted arbitrarily or capriciously in refusing a license when such action was based on evidence from which reasonable men might honestly draw different conclusions. Van DeVegt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 98 Colo. 161, 55 P.2d 703 (1936).

        Where prior to condemnation by the state for highway purposes, there were two successful outlets in Silver Plume; that because of the condemnation proceedings there were none at the time of the application; that the nearest such outlet was two and one-half miles away; that 34 residents indicated the need for such an outlet; and where after denial of the application, but prior to the district court’s review thereof, the trustees issued a similar license to a nearby establishment, the evidence constitutes a prima facie showing of need for the license.

        Three grounds for refusal.
       </b>
       By the express provisions of this section, the state licensing authority is authorized and directed to refuse to grant a license for the failure of an applicant to meet statutory requirements in three particulars only, viz: (1) that the premises for which the license is sought do not meet the requirements of the law; (2) that the character of applicant or its officers is such that violation of the liquor law would likely result; and (3) that existing outlets are adequate for the reasonable needs of the community. MacArthur v. Bishop, 123 Colo. 452, 230 P.2d 589 (1951); Stanley v. Anderson, 158 Colo. 576, 408 P.2d 984 (1965).

       MacArthur v. Bishop, 123 Colo. 452, 230 P.2d 589 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was substantial evidence to support the action of the licensing authority, and no jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional determination or finding was required, and no specific findings were requested and refused, the decision of the licensing authority to refuse a license could not be challenged on the ground that he failed to make any findings or state any reason for his refusal. MacArthur v. Bishop, 123 Colo. 452, 230 P.2d 589 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Witnesses not required.
       </b>
       The power of an agency to do justice informally and promptly is not limited to cases where witnesses have been heard, and without any witnesses at all it may act of its own knowledge, for it is made up of men with special qualifications of training and experience. Geer v. Stathopulos, 135 Colo. 146, 309 P.2d 606 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When an agency acts on its own knowledge, it must set forth in its return the facts
       </b>
       known to its members, but not otherwise disclosed. Geer v. Stathopulos, 135 Colo. 146, 309 P.2d 606 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Facts as to hardship required.
       </b>
       To characterize a situation as a hardship without more does not tend in any substantial degree to enlighten a reviewing court, and therefore there must be disclosure of the facts from which a hardship is inferred. Geer v. Stathopulos, 135 Colo. 146, 309 P.2d 606 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Notice of hearing responsibility of local authority.
       </b>
       The question of whether there has been compliance with the requirement that notice of hearing be given upon the application for a county license is a matter which has been specifically and exclusively entrusted to the local licensing authority. Stanley v. Anderson, 158 Colo. 576, 408 P.2d 984 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Finding of adequacy of notice binding.
       </b>
       The determination of the commissioners on the issue of whether posting of notice of hearing before the commissioners has been adequate is binding upon the state licensing authority. Stanley v. Anderson, 158 Colo. 576, 408 P.2d 984 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The state licensing authority does not have statutory authority to inquire into the adequacy of posting,
       </b>
       once the local licensing authority has made its determination of such question. Stanley v. Anderson, 158 Colo. 576, 408 P.2d 984 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        To favor one applicant over another is discriminatory
       </b>
       and suggests the exercise of an unwarranted and uncontrolled discretion on the part of the licensing authority. Geer v. Presto, 135 Colo. 536, 313 P.2d 980 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Basis for finding denial arbitrary and capricious.
       </b>
       Capricious or arbitrary exercise of discretion by an administrative board can arise by exercising its discretion in such manner after a consideration of evidence before it as clearly to indicate that its action is based on conclusions from the evidence such that reasonable men fairly and honestly considering the evidence must reach contrary conclusions. Geer v. Stathopulos, 135 Colo. 146, 309 P.2d 606 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Denial not arbitrary and capricious.
       </b>
       Where the record of a hearing on an application for a liquor license discloses a situation with reference to which reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, the action of the board of county commissioners in denying such application cannot be adjudged arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable as a matter of law. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Bonicelli, 151 Colo. 308, 377 P.2d 124 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Evidence sufficient to deny license.
       </b>
       Where a plat put in evidence disclosed the existence of 93 liquor outlets within a radius of six blocks of the premises for which the license was sought, and of these, more than half were hotel and restaurant licenses, the evidence was sufficient to support the denial of a hotel and restaurant liquor license. MacArthur v. Bishop, 123 Colo. 452, 230 P.2d 589 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Issuance of a license to another person in an area, shortly after the rejection of applicant’s application on the ground that the needs of the neighborhood were satisfied, would be arbitrary and discriminatory. Geer v. Presto, 135 Colo. 536, 313 P.2d 980 (1957).

         At the time of the application for a license, the applicant shall submit fingerprints and file personal history information concerning the applicant’s qualifications for a license on forms prepared by the state licensing authority. The state and local licensing authorities shall submit such fingerprints to the Colorado bureau of investigation for the purpose of conducting fingerprint-based criminal history record checks. The Colorado bureau of investigation shall forward the fingerprints to the federal bureau of investigation for the purpose of conducting fingerprint-based criminal history record checks. An applicant who has previously submitted fingerprints for alcohol beverage licensing purposes may request that the fingerprints on file be used. When the results of a fingerprint-based criminal history record check of an applicant performed pursuant to this section reveal a record of arrest without a disposition, the licensing authority shall require the applicant to submit to a name-based criminal history record check, as defined in section 22-2-119.3 (6)(d). The licensing authorities shall use the information resulting from the fingerprint-based and, if applicable, name-based criminal history record check to investigate and to determine if an applicant is qualified for a license pursuant to this article 3 and article 4 of this title 44. The licensing authority is not prohibited from verifying any of the information required to be submitted by an applicant pursuant to this section. An applicant shall not be required to submit additional information beyond that required in this subsection (3) unless the licensing authority has determined any of the following:

       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section interdicts any transaction, agreement, or arrangement prohibited by it
       </b>
       and provides that any obligation or liability arising out of any such transaction, agreement, or arrangement shall be unenforceable in any court by or against any such persons and parties entering into such transaction. Fishman v. Davis, 112 F.2d 432 (10th Cir. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A plain reading of this section
       </b>
       demonstrates that the general assembly did not speak to the precise question of below-cost sales of alcohol by manufacturers to retailer, and therefore deference to agency construction is appropriate. Wine &amp; Spirits Wholesalers v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 919 P.2d 894 (Colo. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A person who held a retail liquor license could not acquire an interest in the business of a bankrupt wholesaler,
       </b>
       and a transaction whereby he attempts to acquire such an interest is void under this section and any claim or obligation arising therefrom is unenforceable, because he could not advance money to the bankrupt for an interest in its business and obtain a claim which was enforceable in the bankruptcy court against the estate. Fishman v. Davis, 112 F.2d 432 (10th Cir. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Finding of lack of any indirect interest
       </b>
       in another retail liquor store is supported by competent evidence on the record and is not arbitrary nor capricious. The evidence does not show that the stock transfer of ownership of another liquor store to the wife of the licensee was a sham transaction nor that the licensee retained control of or any interest in another liquor store. Brass Monkey v. Louisville City Council, 870 P.2d 636 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Liquor wholesaler’s extension of credit to retailer unaccompanied with control or attempt to control is not unlawful
       </b>
       under the Colorado liquor law. Majestic Marketing Co. v. Anderson Enters. of Colo., Inc. 32 Colo. App. 369, 511 P.2d 943 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Where decedent, part owner of one bar, advanced money for the construction and equipment of another
       </b>
       bar, plaintiff claiming by and through decedent as his heir and as executrix of decedent’s estate was barred from recovering moneys advanced by decedent for construction of the other bar. Frederics v. Wilson, 31 Colo. App. 117, 500 P.2d 384 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When asserting rights of decedent, a claimant is subject to the limitations appurtenant to any claim decedent might have had,
       </b>
       thus, the working of this section itself, and clear public policy, would bar recovery. Frederics v. Wilson, 31 Colo. App. 117, 500 P.2d 384 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Giving of a chattel mortgage was in violation of this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Installment sale by wholesaler not prohibited.
       </b>
       Absent proof of control or attempt to control a retail licensee by a wholesale licensee, an installment sale or lease of equipment by a wholesaler to a retailer is not prohibited by this section. Nobel, Inc. v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 652 P.2d 1084 (Colo. App. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Installment sale by wholesaler does not constitute unlawful financial assistance.
       </b>
       The leasing of equipment and the sale of equipment on credit by a wholesale liquor licensee to a retail liquor licensee, absent control or attempt to control the retail licensee, does not constitute unlawful financial assistance. Nobel, Inc. v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 652 P.2d 1084 (Colo. App. 1982).

        No-cross-examination order exceeded council authority.

       While the licensing authority may limit the presentation of evidence and cross-examination so as to prevent repetitive or cumulative evidence or cross-examination, the council exceeded its authority by arbitrarily ordering that no cross-examination of witnesses would be allowed at this public hearing.

       Not less than five days prior to the date of hearing, the local licensing authority shall make known its findings based on its investigation in writing to the applicant and other interested parties.

         Before entering any decision approving or denying the application, the local licensing authority shall consider, except where this article 3 specifically provides otherwise, the facts and evidence adduced as a result of its investigation, as well as any other facts, the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood for the type of license for which application has been made, the desires of the adult inhabitants, the number, type, and availability of alcohol beverage outlets located in or near the neighborhood under consideration, and any other pertinent matters affecting the qualifications of the applicant for the conduct of the type of business proposed; except that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood shall not be considered in the issuance of a club liquor license. For the merger and conversion of retail liquor store licenses to a single liquor-licensed drugstore license in accordance with section 44-3-410 (1)(b), the local licensing authority shall consider the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood and the desires of the adult inhabitants of the neighborhood.

         Any petitioning otherwise required to establish the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood shall be waived for a bed and breakfast permit applicant unless the local licensing authority has previously taken affirmative, official action to rescind the availability of such waiver in all subsequent cases.

       No license shall be issued by any local licensing authority after approval of an application until the building in which the business is to be conducted is ready for occupancy with such furniture, fixtures, and equipment in place as is necessary to comply with the applicable provisions of this article 3 and article 4 of this title 44, and then only after inspection of the premises has been made by the licensing authority to determine that the applicant has complied with the architect’s drawing and the plot plan and detailed sketch for the interior of the building submitted with the application.

      <p>
       <b>
        In forfeiture removal action,
       </b>
       absent the owner’s permission, it is a trespass for the officers to remain on the premises longer than is necessary to remove the seized property. Walker v. City of Denver, 720 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the right of public officers to seize personal property carries with it the right to remove the property from the premises, such removal is unjustified if it would result in the destruction or substantial damage to the real property. Walker v. City of Denver, 720 P.2d 619 (Colo. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The fact that a particular type of license is not authorized in the neighborhood does not require the issuance
       </b>
       of such a license if, in fact, the needs of the neighborhood, with respect to the type of beverage authorized to be sold by the license requested, are being met by the existing licenses. Canjar v. Huerta, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Date of city council’s written decision commenced 30-day period.
       </b>
       Where the city council approved an application for a package liquor license and entered its written decision in the form of a statement of approval upon the license application form, which was signed by the mayor and attested by the city clerk, it is the date of the written decision, endorsed upon the application form, and not the date on which applicants received the letter of notification, which commences the 30-day period within which to appeal the decision. White v. City Council, 33 Colo. App. 97, 515 P.2d 487 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The period of limitation under subsection (3) of this section was properly measured from the conclusion of a second hearing
       </b>
       where, at the conclusion of the first hearing on the license application, the matter was tabled for further consideration, and no final action was taken. U-Tote-M of Colo., Inc. v. City of Greenwood Vill., 39 Colo. App. 28, 563 P.2d 373 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The intent of a law which grants discretionary power to licensing officers,
       </b>
       whether expressly or by necessary implication, is that the discretionary decision shall be the outcome of examination and consideration, in other words, that it shall constitute a discharge of official duty, and not a mere expression of personal will. Goehring v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 172 Colo. 1, 469 P.2d 137 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Basis for capricious or arbitrary exercise of discretion.
       </b>
       Capricious or arbitrary exercise of discretion by an administrative board can arise by failing to give candid and honest consideration of the evidence before it on which it is authorized to act in exercising its discretion, and by exercising its discretion in such manner after a consideration of the evidence before it as to clearly indicate that its action is based on conclusions from the evidence such that reasonable men fairly and honestly considering the evidence must reach contrary conclusions. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967); Goehring v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 172 Colo. 1, 469 P.2d 137 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Neighborhood” doesn’t include whole county.
       </b>
       No authority justifies the conclusion that the “neighborhood” involved in an application for a liquor license can be expanded to include and entire county. Bolton v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 164 Colo. 112, 432 P.2d 761 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Boundary lines of a city do not exclude residents on one side or the other from the “neighborhood”
       </b>
       to be considered in connection with applications for liquor licenses. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence or nonexistence of outlets on either side of a city boundary are to be considered by the licensing authority in determining whether reasonable requirements of the neighborhood are being met. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “In or near” are spatial concepts;
       </b>
       “in” means inside of, within the bounds or limits of, and “near” denotes close by, neighboring, or not far from. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In noting the “nearness” of the other outlets the board must consider also their “availability”,
       </b>
       and “availability” contemplates suitableness for the accomplishment of a given purpose, capability of advantageous use or employment. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The licensing authority can require compliance with a zoning law
       </b>
       before permitting a store to open. Goehring v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 172 Colo. 1, 469 P.2d 137 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Opportunity to comply with the zoning laws and restrictions would of necessity be granted to anyone desiring to open a lawful business.
       </b>
       Goehring v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 172 Colo. 1, 469 P.2d 137 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        If the absence of adequate toilet facilities violated a county zoning resolution, it would not be ground in and of itself for denial
       </b>
       of the application for a liquor license. Goehring v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 172 Colo. 1, 469 P.2d 137 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The existence of “desire” for a new outlet is some evidence
       </b>
       that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood were not being met. Anderson v. Spencer, 162 Colo. 328, 426 P.2d 970 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Consideration of size of outlet.
       </b>
       In the absence of guidelines on the size of a proposed outlet in the statute and in the absence of a county zoning requirement for the location involved, a denial based on such grounds is not lawful. Goehring v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 172 Colo. 1, 469 P.2d 137 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        What findings must include.
       </b>
       When a board considers “other pertinent matters” during the course of making its investigation, it must in its findings point out how it feels the applicant’s qualifications to conduct the proposed business were affected by those matters. Wadlow v. Hartman, 191 Colo. 196, 551 P.2d 201 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trial court had no jurisdiction.
       </b>
       Where there was no showing in the trial court that protestants had exhausted their administrative remedies or that certiorari proceedings to review the decision of a local licensing authority to grant an application for a retail liquor store license were not moot, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the certiorari proceedings and should have dismissed the action. Larson v. City &amp; County of Denver, 33 Colo. App. 153, 516 P.2d 448 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Specifications and inspection mandatory.
       </b>
       Under subsection (4), the filing of plans and specifications is mandatory and may not be waived and prior to granting a liquor license the local authority must inspect the premises to determine that the applicant has complied with the architect’s drawing and plans and specifications submitted upon the application. Norris v. Grimsley, 41 Colo. App. 231, 585 P.2d 925 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        City council’s denial of liquor license application was unsupported by competent evidence and was arbitrary
       </b>
       where evidence presented by applicant established a prima facie case for issuance and the only rebuttal evidence was the existence of other liquor stores and a survey result that 26%; percent expressed opposition. Brass Monkey v. Louisville City Council, 870 P.2d 636 (Colo. App. 1994).

       The holder of a liquor license cannot apply for a transfer of his license to a facility where, during the preceding two years, a license has been denied for the reason that the reasonable requirements of the neighborhood and the desires of the inhabitants were being satisfied by existing outlets.

        Condition placed upon use review is impermissible attempt to regulate the hours in which alcohol beverages may be sold.

      </p>
      <p>
       The university of Colorado at Denver was established as a principal campus in the Denver area. However, the medical school, presently located elsewhere within Denver, was not and has not been declared to be a separate state institution with a constitutionally established principal campus, and its location remains entrusted to the discretion of the regents.

       There was no evidence in the record that the John F.

        Meaning of subsection (1)(d)(III).
       </b>
       In view of the general rule of statutory construction that relative and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, will be construed to refer solely to the last antecedent with which they are closely connected, the last clause of subsection (1)(d)(III) modifies only “to the nearest portion of the building in which liquor is to be sold”, and consequently, measurement should proceed from the point nearest a proposed liquor store on the property line of a school by direct pedestrian route rather than the nearest gateway. Moschetti v. Liquor Licensing Auth., 176 Colo. 281, 490 P.2d 299 (1971).

        Separate classification for “hotel and restaurant” and “beer and wine” licenses.
       </b>
       A license permitting hotels and restaurants to sell spirituous liquors in addition to beer and wine to their patrons is an entirely separate class of permit from a “beer and wine” license. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The need for separate classification is obvious in that an exclusively beer and wine license in a restaurant situation will serve a different clientele than that of a license which also provides for the service of spirituous liquors. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision for the separate classifications of hotel and restaurant license and beer and wine license was not an arbitrary or unreasonable act on the part of the general assembly. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).

       City ordinance, which levied varying occupation taxes upon holders of different classes of liquor licenses, but which taxed all licensees holding the same type of license the identical amount each year, was a revenue-raising measure imposed under the city’s taxing power, and not a regulatory measure imposed under the state’s police power.

        Separate classification for “hotel and restaurant” and “beer and wine” licenses.
       </b>
       A license permitting hotels and restaurants to sell spirituous liquors in addition to beer and wine to their patrons is an entirely separate class of permit from a “beer and wine” license. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The need for separate classification is obvious in that an exclusively beer and wine license in a restaurant situation will serve a different clientele than that of a license which also provides for the service of spirituous liquors. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision for the separate classifications of hotel and restaurant license and beer and wine license was not an arbitrary or unreasonable act on the part of the general assembly. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).

        Separate classification for “hotel and restaurant” and “beer and wine” licenses.
       </b>
       A license permitting hotels and restaurants to sell spirituous liquors in addition to beer and wine to their patrons is an entirely separate class of permit from a “beer and wine” license. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The need for separate classification is obvious in that an exclusively beer and wine license in a restaurant situation will serve a different clientele than that of a license which also provides for the service of spirituous liquors. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision for the separate classifications of hotel and restaurant license and beer and wine license was not an arbitrary or unreasonable act on the part of the general assembly. Huerta v. Canjar, 37 Colo. App. 462, 550 P.2d 897 (1976), rev’d on other grounds, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).

       <b>
        The requirement that a licensee maintain a bona fide restaurant business does not impose a reasonable man standard of what constitutes a conventional restaurant.
       </b>
       The fact that the licensee has a lack of tables in the facility and has late hours of operation does not support a conclusion that the licensee was not a bona fide restaurant. Kantara, Inc. v. State of Colo., 991 P.2d 332 (Colo. App. 1999).

      <p>
       <b>
        The fact that a particular type of license is not authorized
       </b>
       in the neighborhood does not require the issuance of such a license, if, in fact, the needs of the neighborhood, with respect to the type of beverage authorized to be sold by the license requested, are being met by existing licenses. Huerta v. Canjar, 193 Colo. 388, 566 P.2d 1071 (1977).

        Regulation prohibiting employees from mingling and soliciting drinks proper.
       </b>
       Regulation of department of revenue, prohibiting liquor establishment licensee from employing a person to “mingle with patrons” and personally solicit the purchase or sale of drinks for use of one soliciting, was a proper exercise of authority delegated by the general assembly. People v. Willson, 187 Colo. 141, 528 P.2d 1315 (1974).

       A distillery pub license may be issued to any person operating a distillery pub and also selling food and alcohol beverages for consumption on the premises. At least fifteen percent of the gross on-premises food and alcohol beverage income of the licensed distillery pub must be from the sale of food. For purposes of this subsection (2), “food” means a quantity of foodstuffs of a nature that is ordinarily consumed by an individual at regular intervals for the purpose of sustenance.

By increasing the excise tax on alcohol beverages in Colorado, it is the intent of this general assembly that the increased revenues derived from this subsection (1) be viewed as one of the sources of funding for the future development of alcoholism treatment programs under the statute enacted in 1973 and for the payment of other related direct and indirect costs caused by the consumption of alcohol beverages.

         Any wholesaler and manufacturer or person in possession shall provide a copy of any lease pertaining to the assets and property described in subsection (1)(a) of this section to the department within ten days after seizure by the department of the assets and property. The department shall verify that the lease is bona fide and notify the owner that the lease has been received by the department. The department shall use its best efforts to notify the owner of the real or personal property that might be subject to the lien created in subsection (1)(a) of this section. The real or personal property of an owner who has made a bona fide lease to a wholesaler or manufacturer shall be exempt from the lien created in subsection (1)(a) of this section if the property can reasonably be identified from the lease description or if the lessee is given an option to purchase in the lease and has not exercised the option to become the owner of the property leased. This exemption shall be effective from the date of the execution of the lease. The exemption shall also apply if the lease is recorded with the county clerk and recorder of the county where the property is located or based or a memorandum of the lease is filed with the department on such forms as may be prescribed by the department after the execution of the lease at a cost for the filing of two dollars and fifty cents per document. Motor vehicles that are properly registered in this state, showing the lessor as owner thereof, shall be exempt from the lien created in subsection (1)(a) of this section; except that said lien shall apply to the extent that the lessee has an earned reserve, allowance for depreciation not to exceed fair market value, or similar interest that is or may be credited to the lessee. Where the lessor and lessee are blood relatives or relatives by law or have twenty-five percent or more common ownership, a lease between the lessee and the lessor shall not be considered as bona fide for the purposes of this section.

       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plain language of subsection (4)(a)(I) requires that a social host must knowingly provide the person under the age of twenty-one a place to consume alcohol.
       
       This section does not impose liability on a social host who provides a venue but does not have knowledge that specific underage persons are drinking at the venue. Przekurat v. Torres,
       <cite class="co_code">

       <b>
        Employer that made alcohol beverages available to an employee on its premises after work hours was acting as a social host
       </b>
       and not liable for injuries sustained by third parties as a result of the employee’s operation of a motor vehicle after consuming the alcohol beverages. Rojas v. Engineered Plastic Designs, Inc., 68 P.3d 591 (Colo. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Employer is a “social host” within the meaning of this act and is protected from liability for injuries caused by its guest even though
       </b>
       it did not furnish alcohol to anyone at a party on its premises. Shielding a party host who directly supplies alcohol from liability while not protecting the seemingly less-culpable host who does not, even if both do not prevent drinking, would be contrary not only to logic and common sense, but to the stated purpose of the act, which is to shift the responsibility for drinking alcohol from the vendor or provider to the consumer of alcohol beverages. McCray v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 437 F. Supp. 3d 907 (D. Colo. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A victim need not show his or her injuries were a reasonable foreseeable consequence of licensed alcohol vendor serving a visibly intoxicated person.
       </b>
       It suffices that the vendor’s improper service of alcohol caused the patron’s intoxication and patron’s intoxication caused the victim’s injuries. Strauch v. Build It, 226 P.3d 1235 (Colo. App. 2009), aff’d, 253 P.3d 302 (Colo. 2011).
      </p>

       <b>
        This statute found constitutional
       </b>
       in that it does not violate due process by being unconstitutionally vague, does not violate equal protection rights of heirs of intoxicated person because the statute is rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of preventing negligence by consumers of alcohol, does not unconstitutionally limit access to courts, and is not constitutionally-prohibited special legislation. Sigman v. Seafood Ltd. P’ship I, 817 P.2d 527 (Colo. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (4) does not deny equal protection.
       </b>
       The classification is based on a previously established distinction between minors and adults with respect to alcohol consumption and the state has a legitimate interest in deterring alcohol-related injuries caused by minors. Charlton v. Kimata, 815 P.2d 946 (Colo. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Under the plain language of this section,
       </b>
       a licensee may be held civilly liable only if the licensee knows that he or she is serving alcohol to a person under twenty-one years of age and willfully does so. Dickman v. Jackalope, Inc., 870 P.2d 1261 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The terms “willfully and knowingly” in this section
       </b>
       apply both to the words “sold or served” and to the phrase “to such person who was under the age of twenty-one years”, and a different interpretation would render the “willful and knowing” language meaningless since it is difficult to imagine any sales or service of alcohol by a licensee which are not deliberate. Dickman v. Jackalope, Inc., 870 P.2d 1261 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a licensee “willfully and knowingly” sold or served alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person is generally a question of fact which may be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence. Christoph v. Colo. Comm. Corp., 946 P.2d 519 (Colo. App. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The addition of the words “willfully and knowingly” to this section relating to imposition of civil liability,
       </b>
       together with the fact that the civil liability section does not include the good-faith defense contained in § 12-47-128 (5)(a)(I), buttresses the conclusion that the general assembly did not intend that this be a strict liability provision, but rather one requiring a plaintiff to prove knowledge and intention on the part of the vendor. Dickman v. Jackalope, Inc., 870 P.2d 1261 (Colo. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Heirs of fatally injured intoxicated person may not maintain wrongful death action against vendor of alcoholic beverages
       </b>
       because this statute abolishes such actions by the consumers of alcohol and the wrongful death statute permits heirs to maintain such actions only if the deceased could have done so had the deceased’s injuries not been fatal. Sigman v. Seafood Ltd. P’ship I, 817 P.2d 527 (Colo. 1991).

       <b>
        Trial court did not err in determining that two plaintiffs’ combined recovery against two separate establishments was limited to $150,000.
       </b>
       This section describes the civil action as one in which a single licensee is civilly liable to an injured individual. If the statute required plaintiffs to maintain separate actions against each licensee, each plaintiff would have been required to file separate actions against both licensees, a waste of judicial resources not intended by the general assembly. Brown v. Hollywood Bar and Cafe, 942 P.2d 1363 (Colo. App. 1997).

        A reviewing court is concerned only with the question of whether the decision of the licensing authority was supported by competent evidence,

       and not whether the trial court or the reviewing court would have arrived at a different conclusion were they the licensing authority. City of Manitou Springs v. Walk, 149 Colo. 43, 367 P.2d 744 (1961).

        Arbitrary and capricious refusal basis for order to issue license.
       </b>
       Since the licensing authority’s rulings are subject to review by the courts, if its action in refusing to grant a license is found to be arbitrary or capricious, then a court has the authority, and the duty, to order the license to issue. Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Salardino, 136 Colo. 421, 318 P.2d 596 (1957); Adams County Golf, Inc. v. Colo. Dept. of Rev., 199 Colo. 423, 610 P.2d 97 (1980).

        Findings of fact sufficient for review.

       It is not required that the licensing authority make findings of fact equivalent to that of a trial court, but they must be sufficient to furnish a basis for judicial review if the statutory requirements are to be fulfilled. Le Pore v. Larkin, 146 Colo. 311, 361 P.2d 343 (1961).

       Findings of fact should be sufficient in content to apprise the parties and a reviewing court of the factual basis of an action of the administrative agency, so that the parties and the reviewing tribunal may determine whether the decision has support in the evidence and in the law.

       The question before the supreme court is not as to whether there was any evidence to support the decision of the trial court, but rather whether there was any evidence to support the decision of the licensing authority, or whether he acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Geer v. Stathopulos, 135 Colo. 146, 309 P.2d 606 (1957).

        Even where the final order rests in whole or in part upon judicial notice of facts,

       When a court is called upon to review the action of an administrative agency, it should be placed in the same position as such agency, and if the administrative agency has knowledge of some fact and acts upon such knowledge, the agency should see to it that what it knows becomes part of the record in order to permit the reviewing court to evaluate the matter so known, only then can the court be in the same position as the agency in a consideration of the problem successively confronting agency and court.

       The refusal of a local licensing authority to grant a license may be reviewed by the court, as in the case of a refusal of license by the state licensing authority, by writ of certiorari or otherwise, and if the court having jurisdiction shall determine that such action was capricious or arbitrary it shall order the issuance of the license.

        No court order available to interfere with issuance, etc.

       <b>
        Subsection (1)(a) requires a showing of constructive knowledge.
       </b>
       It is not a strict liability offense. Constructive knowledge means “knowledge that one using reasonable care or diligence should have and, therefore, that is attributed by law to a given person”. The holder of a liquor license and the licensee’s agents have an affirmative responsibility to reasonably conduct the business with a view to compliance with the law. Full Moon Saloon, Inc. v. City of Loveland, 111 P.3d 568 (Colo. App. 2005) (decided under former law); Morris-Schindler, LLC v. City &amp; County of Denver, 251 P.3d 1076 (Colo. App. 2010).

       <b>
        “Habitual drunkard” has a common meaning.
       </b>
       Whether a person is a habitual drunkard is an issue of fact based upon the circumstances of each case. The knowledge of the vendor may be shown by direct or circumstantial evidence and does not require a formal notice or prior court adjudication. K &amp; S Corp. v. Greeley Liquor Licensing Auth., 183 P.3d 710 (Colo. App. 2008).

        Affirmative defense set forth in subsection (5) only available when minor presents a currently valid form of identification.

       A license shall not be revoked or suspended for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 21 if the person presents a fraudulent proof of age. Nevertheless, the department may revoke or suspend a license if the fraudulent proof of age is not currently valid. “Currently valid identification” includes being facially valid, not expired, and valid as to form.

        The authority of a liquor enforcement officer does not exceed that of his principal.

        Authority only within specified territory.
       </b>
       The assignment to a liquor enforcement officer of a specified territory in which to perform his duties carries a clear implication that he was to perform his duties within such territory and not elsewhere, and no presumption arises that he had authority beyond the boundaries of his allotted territory. Fouquet v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 144 Colo. 240, 355 P.2d 943 (1960).

        No authority to participate in private business.
       </b>
       It is no part of the legal authority of the liquor license division or of a liquor enforcement officer to promote, facilitate, or assist in the purchase and sale of any business and premises, whatever its nature. Fouquet v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 144 Colo. 240, 355 P.2d 943 (1960).

        Nor travel for such purpose.
       </b>
       Even though the answering of questions and supplying of information are generally within a liquor enforcement officer’s implied authority, such authority, however, cannot be extended to embrace a trip to a distant city to assist in the promotion of a private transaction in which neither he nor his employer had an official interest.

       In addition to any other sanctions prescribed by this article 10 or rules promulgated pursuant to this article 10, the state licensing authority or local licensing authority has the power, on its own motion or on complaint, after investigation and opportunity for a public hearing at which the licensee must be afforded an opportunity to be heard, to fine a licensee or to suspend or revoke a license issued by the authority for a violation by the licensee or by any of the agents or employees of the licensee of the provisions of this article 10, or any of the rules promulgated pursuant to this article 10, or of any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of the license issued by the state or local licensing authority. The state or local licensing authority has the power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to require the presence of persons and the production of papers, books, and records necessary to the determination of a hearing that the state or local licensing authority is authorized to conduct.
      </li>
      <li id="t44a10p09s44-10-901ol12">
       The state or local licensing authority shall provide notice of suspension, revocation, fine, or other sanction, as well as the required notice of the hearing pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, by mailing the same in writing to the licensee at the address contained in the license and, if different, at the last address furnished to the authority by the licensee. Except in the case of a summary suspension, a suspension is not for a period longer than six months. If a license is suspended or revoked, a part of the fees paid therefor are not returned to the licensee. Any license, registration, or permit may be summarily suspended by the issuing authority without notice pending any prosecution, investigation, or public hearing pursuant to the terms of section 24-4-104 (4). Nothing in this section prevents the summary suspension of a license pursuant to section 24-4-104 (4). Each patient registered with a medical marijuana store that has had its license summarily suspended may immediately transfer his or her primary store to another licensed medical marijuana store.

Upon the receipt of the petition, the state or local licensing authority may, in its sole discretion, stay the proposed suspension and cause any investigation to be made that it deems desirable and may, in its sole discretion, grant the petition if the state or local licensing authority is satisfied that:

The order may further specify that the licensee loses any interest in any of the marijuana or marijuana product even if the marijuana or marijuana product previously qualified as regulated marijuana or a regulated marijuana product. The final agency order may direct the destruction of any such marijuana and marijuana products, except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section.

The licensee shall serve the petition in accordance with the Colorado rules of civil procedure. The district court shall promptly rule upon the petition and determine whether the licensee has a substantial likelihood of success on judicial review so as to warrant delay of the destruction authorized by subsection (4) of this section or whether other circumstances, including but not limited to the need for preservation of evidence, warrant delay of such destruction. If destruction is so delayed pursuant to judicial order, the court shall issue an order setting forth terms and conditions pursuant to which the licensee may maintain the regulated marijuana and regulated marijuana product pending judicial review and prohibiting the licensee from using or distributing the regulated marijuana or regulated marijuana product pending the review. The licensing authority shall not carry out the destruction authorized by subsection (4) of this section until fifteen days have passed without the filing of a petition for stay of agency action or until the court has issued an order denying stay of agency action pursuant to this subsection (5).

        Mobile home not motor vehicle.
       </b>
       Mobile homes fall within the statutory definition of “movable structure”. This definition recognizes the general or common use of the product as being for residential purposes. A motor vehicle, on the other hand, is designed primarily for travel on the public highways. Shaw v. Aurora Mobile Homes &amp; Real Estate, Inc., 36 Colo. App. 321, 539 P.2d 1366 (1975).

        Mobile home dealers are not subject to article.

       Since the definition of a motor vehicle dealer specifies motor vehicles as the exclusive subject matter bringing a person within the coverage of § 12-6-111, that bond does not cover activities in the sale of mobile homes, i.e., “movable structures”.

       Since the definition of a dealer specifies motor vehicles as the exclusive subject matter bringing a person within the coverage of this section, that bond does not cover activities in the sale of mobile homes, i.e., “movable structures”.

       for the payment of damages resulting from fraud, which actually took place prior to the date the bond became effective, upon the ground that, after the bond became effective, the wrongdoer made new false representations concerning the subject matter of his original transaction but upon the making of which the defrauded party did not part with value in reliance thereon.

        The phrase “any person” in the pre-1992 version of this section refers only to those consumers or purchasers, including natural persons, firms, partnerships, and corporations, to whom a motor vehicle title is transferred by a bonded dealer.

       Consequently, the phrase does not encompass a corporation that, although not a consumer or purchaser of a motor vehicle, has a business relationship or contract with an automobile dealer. Sw. Cap. Inv. v. Pioneer Gen. Ins., 924 P.2d 1205 (Colo. App. 1996).

       <b>
        Application of section not overbroad.
       </b>
       The application of this section with regard to the refusal to honor any written agreement with a retail buyer is not overbroad. Michael Motors, Inc. v. Colo. Dealer Licensing Bd., 200 Colo. 455, 616 P.2d 110 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 995, 101 S. Ct. 1696, 68 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When accorded its common meaning,
       </b>
       phrase “material particulars” of subsection (3)(i) means those details concerning a vehicle for sale that are essential or necessary for a reasonable prospective buyer to know. Phrase is thus readily understandable and is not unconstitutionally vague. Spedding v. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd., 931 P.2d 480 (Colo. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Plain meaning of words used
       </b>
       in subsection (3)(i) clearly requires a finding of “willful” failure to disclose material particulars to a buyer. Thus, board erred in suspending motor vehicle dealer’s license without specifically finding conduct was “willful.” Spedding v. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd., 931 P.2d 480 (Colo. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Term “intentionally” in subsection (3)(k) applies to all elements of conduct proscribed.
       </b>
       This paragraph prohibits the intentional publication or circulation of advertising which the motor vehicle dealer knows to be inaccurate or misleading. Bedford Motors, Inc. v. Harris, 714 P.2d 489 (Colo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Multiple licenses permitted.
       </b>
       The automobile dealer licensing statute, § 12-6-101, does not expressly permit or disallow a salesman to be licensed to more than one dealer. However, subsection (5)(g) of this section indicates a legislative intent that multiple licensing be permitted. United Buying Serv., Inc. v. State Dept. of Rev., 37 Colo. App. 465, 548 P.2d 1286 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the general assembly had intended salesmen to be licensed to one dealer only, the portion of subsection (5)(g) reading “while licensed under only one such dealer ...” would be superfluous, a condition contrary to proper statutory construction. United Buying Serv., Inc. v. State Dept. of Rev., 37 Colo. App. 465, 548 P.2d 1286 (1976).

        Finding of enforceability of agreement not prerequisite to imposition of sanction.
       </b>
       The enforceability of an agreement need not be found by the Colorado dealer licensing board before it may impose a sanction for violation of subsection (3)(f). Michael Motors, Inc. v. Colo. Dealer Licensing Bd., 200 Colo. 455, 616 P.2d 110 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 995, 101 S. Ct. 1696, 68 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1981).

      <p>
       <b>
        Mistake of law is no defense to culpable actions.
       </b>
       The question regarding the contractual nature of a written agreement is a question of law, and it is axiomatic that a mistake of law is no defense to the culpability of a person’s actions. Michael Motors, Inc. v. Colo. Dealer Licensing Bd., 200 Colo. 455, 616 P.2d 110 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 995, 101 S. Ct. 1696, 68 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (3)(e), the phrase “person’s damage” refers to any person suffering damages from fraud.

        Subsection (5)(q) does not apply to ordinary theft.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (7)(a)(I) is limited to specific felony convictions,

       and because such convictions may serve as a basis for delaying but not permanently denying a motor vehicle salesperson license, this section does not make a criminal conviction, without more, the basis for denying a license; therefore, there is no irreconcilable conflict between this section and § 24-5-101.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (1)(h) is unconstitutionally vague
       </b>
       because persons of common intelligence must guess at the meaning of the term prohibiting the addition of a franchise if it “would be inequitable to the existing dealer”. Mike Naughton Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 862 F. Supp. 264 (D. Colo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Former provisions violated the commerce clause of the United States constitution.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        While it may be conceded that, under its police power, a state may protect its people against coercion,
       </b>
       inducement is another thing. GMC v. Blevins, 144 F. Supp. 381 (D. Colo. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There is nothing evil or wrong about inducing; it is simply the process of salesmanship.
       </b>
       GMC v. Blevins, 144 F. Supp. 381 (D. Colo. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        According to Webster’s New International Dictionary, “induce” means
       </b>
       “to lead on, to influence, to prevail on to move by persuasion or influence”. GMC v. Blevins, 144 F. Supp. 381 (D. Colo. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Induce” is to persuade by legitimate argument or demonstration, and is distinguished from “coerce”,
       </b>
       which is to compel by threat or other wrongful action. GMC v. Blevins, 144 F. Supp. 381 (D. Colo. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Salesmanship is part of the American way of life, and the selling of new products requires inducement.
       </b>

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The appointment of a replacement dealership for a previously established distribution point does not fall within the definition of “additional franchise” under subsection (1)(h).
       </b>
       The appointment would simply maintain the same number of dealerships authorized in the area prior to the dispute. Mike Naughton Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 862 F. Supp. 264 (D. Colo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Use of the phrase “including, but not limited to” in subsection (1)(d)(II) is not restrictive.
       </b>
       Where dealer contract, by its terms, could be renewed only “upon joint agreement” of the dealer and manufacturer, manufacturer had “just cause” and did not violate subsection (1)(d) when it failed to renew dealer contract. Maehal Enters. v. Thunder Mtn. Custom, 313 P.3d 584 (Colo. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        For purposes of the manufacturer’s obligation to repurchase unsold motor vehicles as required in subsection (1)(l)(I)(A), “acquired” means the point at which the dealer takes possession of the motor vehicles,
       </b>
       regardless of when the dealer obtains the certificates of title for the motor vehicles. Maehal Enters. v. Thunder Mtn. Custom, 313 P.3d 584 (Colo. App. 2011).

       Since § 44-20-125 is similar to § 12-6-120.3 as it existed prior to its 2018 relocation to this section, a relevant case construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this section.

       <b>
        The 2017 amendment to the definition of “relevant market area” does not violate the contracts clause of either the federal or state constitution.
       </b>
       The amendment is an evolution of the existing scheme for regulating the relationship between dealers and car manufacturers. Because the 2017 amendment is not a substantial impairment of the contractual relationships between dealers and manufacturers, it does not violate the contracts clause of either the federal or state constitution. DC Auto., Inc. v. Kia Motors Am., Inc., 411 F. Supp. 3d 1137 (D. Colo. 2019) (decided under former § 12-6-120.3 as amended in 2017 and prior to its 2018 relocation to this title 44).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Application of the 2017 amendment does not violate article II, § 11 of the state constitution.
       </b>
       Car manufacturer’s purported right to establish a proposed dealership at a certain location is not based on a contract between it and dealers; rather, it relies on the continued existence of the regulatory scheme that places the location of a proposed dealership outside dealers’ relevant market area. Moreover, regulation of the relationship between manufacturers and dealers is within the longstanding province of the legislature. Because manufacturer’s contractual expectation relied on the continued validity of the regulatory scheme in an area within traditional legislative power, manufacturer has no vested right to establish the proposed dealership. DC Auto., Inc. v. Kia Motors Am., Inc., 411 F. Supp. 3d 1137 (D. Colo. 2019) (decided under § 12-6-120.3 as amended in 2017 and prior to its 2018 relocation to this title 44).

       by (1) Directing the agency to establish rules and regulations; (2) providing for an inquiry into the criminal history of an applicant to determine whether a threat to the public interest or to controlled gaming exists; (3) squarely placing the burden of establishing qualification for licensing upon the applicant; and (4) providing for effective judicial review.

        License conditions and revocation authorized by law and constitution.
       </b>
       The gaming commission was within its statutory authority in conditioning a key employee license on payment of back child support and taxes and revoking such license for failure to comply with such conditions. The gaming commission did not abuse its discretion or violate due process in so revoking the license where the licensee was given a reasonable opportunity to comply with such conditions, failed to provide requested income tax returns, and made false statements of material fact to the investigator regarding the filing of tax returns and where the gaming commission provided the licensee with substantial evidentiary leeway, allowed the licensee to cross-examine and impeach the investigator, and gave the licensee the opportunity to argue the proper standard for license revocation.

       The gaming commission was within its statutory authority in conditioning a key employee license on payment of back child support and taxes and revoking such license for failure to comply with such conditions. The gaming commission did not abuse its discretion or violate due process in so revoking the license where the licensee was given a reasonable opportunity to comply with such conditions, failed to provide requested income tax returns, and made false statements of material fact to the investigator regarding the filing of tax returns and where the gaming commission provided the licensee with substantial evidentiary leeway, allowed the licensee to cross-examine and impeach the investigator, and gave the licensee the opportunity to argue the proper standard for license revocation.

        Commission did not err in concluding that 21 Superbucks does not constitute a legally permissible slot machine.

       Subsection (26) defines “slot machine” to mean a mechanical device which, upon the insertion of a coin, may entitle a player to cash. 21 Superbucks relies, however, not only on a coin or token, but also on the deal of a traditional blackjack hand. Furthermore, there is no indication that the numerous express controls placed on slot machines under the detailed regulations in Colorado gaming control commission rule 12 are a part of the operation of 21 Superbucks.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If, in the determination of the commission, an employee of a licensee for limited gaming is a key employee and as such is subject to licensure, the commission shall serve notice of the determination upon the licensee who employed the key employee. In determining whether or not an employee is a key employee, the commission is not restricted by the title of the job performed by the employee but may consider the functions and responsibilities of the employee in making its decision. The licensee shall, within thirty days following receipt of the notice of the commission’s determination, present the application for licensing of the employee to the commission or provide documentary evidence that the employee is no longer employed by the licensee. Failure of the licensee to respond as required by this section is grounds for disciplinary action. A person subject to application for licensing as a key employee may make written request to the commission to review its determination of the person’s status within the gaming organization. If the commission determines that the person is not a key employee, the person shall be allowed to withdraw his or her application and continue in his or her employment. The request by an employee for review of his or her employment status does not stay the obligation of the licensee to present the employee’s application to the commission within the thirty-day period prescribed by this section.

      Every license issued pursuant to this article 30 is revocable and nontransferable. No licensee acquires any vested interest or property right in a license. The gaming licenses issued pursuant to this article 30 are only for the particular location initially authorized. The revocable privilege for any license issued or other approval granted is conditioned upon the proper and continuing qualification of the licensee or registrant and upon the discharge of the affirmative responsibility of each licensee or registrant to provide to the regulatory, investigatory, and law enforcement authorities any assistance and information necessary to assure that the policies and requirements of this article 30 are achieved.

        License conditions and revocation authorized by law and constitution.
       </b>
       The gaming commission was within its statutory authority in conditioning a key employee license on payment of back child support and taxes and revoking such license for failure to comply with such conditions. The gaming commission did not abuse its discretion or violate due process in so revoking the license where the licensee was given a reasonable opportunity to comply with such conditions, failed to provide requested income tax returns, and made false statements of material fact to the investigator regarding the filing of tax returns and where the gaming commission provided the licensee with substantial evidentiary leeway, allowed the licensee to cross-examine and impeach the investigator, and gave the licensee the opportunity to argue the proper standard for license revocation. Feeney v. Colo. Ltd. Gaming Control Comm’n, 890 P.2d 173 (Colo. App. 1994) (decided under former § 12-47.1-504).

        Constitutional.
       </b>
       Gambling is a privilege, not a right, so federal due process rights are not affected. Assuming that an applicant has a sufficient property or liberty interest in the license so that a due process claim can be asserted, the restrictions to licensing in this section are reasonably related to the proper goal of assuring both honest gaming and the public perception that the gaming is honest. In addition, this reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest is sufficient to result in the statute withstanding a claim that it is unconstitutional on its face as a violation of equal protection.

The gaming commission did not abuse its discretion or violate due process in so revoking the license where the licensee was given a reasonable opportunity to comply with such conditions, failed to provide requested income tax returns, and made false statements of material fact to the investigator regarding the filing of tax returns and where the gaming commission provided the licensee with substantial evidentiary leeway, allowed the licensee to cross-examine and impeach the investigator, and gave the licensee the opportunity to argue the proper standard for license revocation.

     <p>
      The commission may approve or deny any application for a license, in addition to all other conditions and requirements set forth in this article 30 and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto, on the basis of whether it deems the applicant a suitable person to hold the license applied for and whether it considers the proposed location, retail floor plan, or any other conditions suitable. Refusal of an applicant to provide all information requested by the commission or to allow investigation into the applicant’s background is grounds for denial of a license. Information requested from the applicant by the commission shall include the applicant’s date of birth in addition to other information necessary to identify and investigate fully the record and relevant history of the applicant.

        License conditions and revocation authorized by law and constitution.
       </b>
       The gaming commission was within its statutory authority in conditioning a key employee license on payment of back child support and taxes and revoking such license for failure to comply with such conditions. The gaming commission did not abuse its discretion or violate due process in so revoking the license where the licensee was given a reasonable opportunity to comply with such conditions, failed to provide requested income tax returns, and made false statements of material fact to the investigator regarding the filing of tax returns and where the gaming commission provided the licensee with substantial evidentiary leeway, allowed the licensee to cross-examine and impeach the investigator, and gave the licensee the opportunity to argue the proper standard for license revocation. Feeney v. Colo. Ltd. Gaming Control Comm’n, 890 P.2d 173 (Colo. App. 1994) (decided under former § 12-47.1-525).

         Legislative declaration. The general assembly finds, determines, and declares that:
         <p>
          <b>
           (a) (I)
          </b>
          Section 9 (7) of article XVIII of the state constitution, initiated and enacted by the people of Colorado in 2008 and commonly referred to as “Amendment 50”, authorized the extension of limited gaming activity for the purpose of helping fund Colorado’s community colleges, junior colleges, and local district colleges through an increase in gaming tax revenues;
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           (II)
          </b>
          Amendment 50 explicitly authorized the general assembly to “enact, as necessary, legislation that will facilitate the operation of this [initiative]”;
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           (III)
          </b>
          Pursuant to that authority, it is reasonable for the general assembly to address the effects of the global pandemic and economic recession of 2020 in a way that:
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           (A)
          </b>
          Avoids long-term economic damage to any of the beneficiaries of limited gaming tax revenues; and
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           (B)
          </b>
          Equitably allocates the limited gaming tax revenues in fiscal years immediately following this severe funding decline among all recipients; and

         <p>
          <b>
           (IV)
          </b>
          The allocation provisions of section 9 (7) of article XVIII of the state constitution do not contemplate the unprecedented significant decline in limited gaming revenues caused by the global pandemic, and the general assembly desires to address the original implementing statutory formula for the allocation of gaming revenues, consistent with the state constitution, in a manner that modifies the statutory annual adjustment provisions to retain the constitutional allocation, thus reflecting the proportionate allocation to the beneficiaries of limited gaming tax revenues.

           Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (3)(b) or (4)(d) of this section to the contrary, beginning in state fiscal year 2020-21 and continuing through each subsequent fiscal year until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which total limited gaming tax revenue collections have again equaled or exceeded the amount of total limited gaming tax revenues collected in state fiscal year 2018-19, any annual growth or decline in total net gaming tax distributions shall be allocated between the limited gaming fund recipients listed in section 9 (5)(b)(II) of article XVIII of the state constitution and the recipients of limited gaming tax revenues attributable to extended limited gaming under section 9 (7) of article XVIII of the state constitution based on the relative percentages in which each group of recipients shared in the decrease in total net gaming tax distributions from state fiscal year 2018-19 to state fiscal year 2019-20. The commission may make any adjustments necessary to ensure that the final distributions to all recipients comply with constitutional requirements while achieving the intent of this subsection (7). So long as this subsection (7) remains in effect, the annual adjustments required under subsections (3)(b) and (4)(d) of this section are temporarily superseded by the specific allocations to implement the constitutional annual adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (7).

        License conditions and revocation authorized by law and constitution.
       </b>
       The gaming commission was within its statutory authority in conditioning a key employee license on payment of back child support and taxes and revoking such license for failure to comply with such conditions. The gaming commission did not abuse its discretion or violate due process in so revoking the license where the licensee was given a reasonable opportunity to comply with such conditions, failed to provide requested income tax returns, and made false statements of material fact to the investigator regarding the filing of tax returns and where the gaming commission provided the licensee with substantial evidentiary leeway, allowed the licensee to cross-examine and impeach the investigator, and gave the licensee the opportunity to argue the proper standard for license revocation. Feeney v. Colo. Ltd. Gaming Control Comm’n, 890 P.2d 173 (Colo. App. 1994) (decided under former § 12-47.1-801).

         Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport. Race horses weigh in excess of one thousand pounds, are almost six feet in height at the withers, and can run faster than thirty miles per hour. Horse racing brings significant physical risks to humans and horses. Jockeys and other persons working with horses have been injured before, during, and after horse races, occasionally resulting in death. As a result of these risks, it is crucial that persons working with horses in racing must at all times be free of any substances that might impair their judgement, reflexes, or ability to control a horse. Recent drug testing of horse racing licensees has shown instances of illegal drug use and consumption of alcohol in excess of statutory limitations, which could, therefore, endanger both human and equine participants. The most effective method of preventing alcohol and drug abuse and ensuring the safety of all persons and animals included in the sport of horse racing is to establish a program of alcohol and drug testing.

No member shall have been convicted of a felony or gambling-related offense, notwithstanding the provisions of section 24-5-101. No more than three of the five members shall be members of the same political party. At the first meeting of each fiscal year, a chair and vice-chair of the commission shall be chosen from the membership by a majority of the members. Membership and operation of the commission shall additionally meet the following requirements:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t44a32p03s44-32-301ol11a">
         Two members of the commission shall have been previously engaged in the racing industry for at least five years; one member shall be a practicing veterinarian who is currently licensed in Colorado and has been so licensed for not less than five years; one member shall have been engaged in business in a management-level capacity for at least five years; and one member shall be a registered elector of the state who is not employed in any profession or industry otherwise described in this subsection (1)(a); however, no more than two members of the commission shall be from the same congressional district, and one member of the commission shall be from west of the continental divide.

All subsequent appointments shall be for terms of four years. No member of the commission shall be eligible to serve more than two consecutive terms.

        <li id="t44a32p03s44-32-301ol11h">
         The commission shall hold at least one meeting each quarter and such additional meetings as may be prescribed by rules of the commission. In addition, special meetings may be called by the chair, any two commission members, or the director, if written notification of the meeting is delivered to each member at least seventy-two hours prior to the meeting. Notwithstanding section 24-6-402, in emergency situations in which a majority of the commission certifies that exigencies of time require that the commission meet without delay, the requirements of public notice and of seventy-two hours’ actual advance written notice to members may be dispensed with, and commission members as well as the public shall receive such notice as is reasonable under the circumstances. Any action by the commission during such emergency meetings shall be limited to those issues relating to the emergency situation for which the meeting was called.

       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Regardless of any reference to, or discussion of, the subject of racing being what formerly had been a prohibited and unlawful undertaking,
       </b>
       the people by their vote adopted a public policy to the effect that racing such as is here involved within this state is legal. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        It is evident that the people in legalizing racing did so as a means of obtaining revenue for the general fund
       </b>
       and the commission has no power or authority to interfere with this clearly intended purpose. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section requires the racing commission to maintain and operate all race tracks
       </b>
       in accordance with the laws of the state and the rules of the commission. Colo. Racing Comm’n v. Conner, 30 Colo. App. 72, 490 P.2d 75 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Under the provisions of subsection (1), the racing commission is charged with the duty of regulating and supervising
       </b>
       all race meets involving pari-mutuel wagering that are held in the state of Colo. Colo. Racing Comm’n v. Conner, 30 Colo. App. 72, 490 P.2d 75 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rule of the racing commission that requires race tracks to install and maintain, at their own expense, video surveillance systems in pari-mutual wagering areas is authorized by subsection (1)(a).
       </b>
       The costs of doing business and complying with licensing rules, which include the cost of equipment necessary for the collection of information used by the commission to regulate, are the race tracks’ responsibility under subsection (1)(a). Mile High Greyhound Park v. Racing Comm’n, 12 P.3d 351 (Colo. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Effect of “shall” in subsection (1).
       </b>
       The general assembly, by the employment of the word “shall” in connection with the issuance of a license, unquestionably intended that such was to be put beyond the pale of permissive action on the part of the commission in cases where the applicant has met every requirement of the act in connection with its application and does not fall within the specific prohibitions of the act. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Concerning the matter of determining that it was not to the best interest of racing or to the public’s interest to grant the license applied for,
       </b>
       this was definitely beyond the function or authority of the commission, because the matter of declaration of public policy such as was here undertaken is a legislative matter, or sometimes to be found in the expression of the people by their vote on certain issues. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        It is not for the commission to say what is or is not the needs of certain localities,
       </b>
       or what is to the interest of racing. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        So far as the interest of racing is concerned that is an economic factor which takes care of itself,
       </b>
       and the act provides the lines of proximity within which the commission cannot encroach in granting a license. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Under the guise of “best interest of racing or the public interest”, the commission would have complete control of all future racing
       </b>
       within the state according to its own peculiar notions or grounds. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Other duties.
       </b>
       Besides the racing commission being charged with the duty to license, regulate, and supervise all race meets, it specifically takes saliva or urine samples from the horses. Harbour v. Colo. State Racing Comm’n, 32 Colo. App. 1, 505 P.2d 22 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        It is the supreme court’s duty to give full respect to the findings of a commission and the discretion exercised
       </b>
       if the discretion was exercised on matters it could lawfully consider. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The appointment of race track stewards and the delegation to them of certain supervisory functions
       </b>
       constitutes only an exercise by the racing commission of its right to employ supervisory personnel in accordance with the provisions of this section. Colo. Racing Comm’n v. Conner, 30 Colo. App. 72, 490 P.2d 75 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The commission, by the exercise of the right to employ race track stewards, does not and cannot totally foreclose itself from discharging its duties of investigating,
       </b>
       determining, and redressing possible acts of impropriety occurring in connection with races committed to its jurisdiction, because such duties are quasi-judicial in nature, and must remain ultimately the responsibility of the commission. Colo. Racing Comm’n v. Conner, 30 Colo. App. 72, 490 P.2d 75 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Where no complaint or objection concerning the running of a race was ever made to the race track stewards by the owner, trainer, or jockey of a horse allegedly fouled,
       </b>
       but the owner did request the racing commission to investigate the race after the results of that race were officially announced, the substantive question concerned the propriety of the manner in which a race was run and the propriety of conduct on the part of persons subject to the commission’s supervision, because it was the statutory duty of the commission to investigate and resolve such question, and, if necessary, the commission could have proceeded by ordering a hearing solely on its own motion, as it has authorized itself to do in the rules governing horse racing, and since the determination of the question involved was always within the scope of its jurisdiction, any questions concerning the necessity of a prior determination by the stewards or concerning the owner’s standing to object became immaterial. Colo. Racing Comm’n v. Conner, 30 Colo. App. 72, 490 P.2d 75 (1971).

        Racing commission was not precluded from making financial irresponsibility grounds for discipline,

At the time and place mentioned in the notice, the commission shall conduct a public hearing at which evidence for and against the granting of the application may be presented.

       Except as otherwise limited by the provisions of this article 32, in considering an application for a license under this section, the commission may give consideration to the number of licenses already granted, and to the location of tracks previously licensed, and to the sentiments and character of the community in which the proposed race meets are to be conducted, and to the ability, character, and experience of each individual applicant or the officers and directors of each corporate applicant. The commission may require of every applicant for a license to hold a race meet, except a public nonprofit association, nonprofit corporation, or nonprofit fair, including the Colorado state fair and all county fairs, who has not, within five years prior to making an application for a license to hold a race meet, operated a race meet in the county, city, or city and county in which it is proposed to hold the race meet, a recommendation in writing of the board of county commissioners of the county in the event the race meet is to be held in unincorporated areas of the county or of the governing board of a city or city and county if the proposed race meet is to be held within a city or city and county. The commission may take the recommendation into consideration before granting or refusing the license. The commission may deny a license to operate a new racetrack to a person who is already licensed to operate a racetrack within this or any other state if, in the opinion of the commission, the granting of the license would discourage legitimate competition from other qualified applicants. The commission shall investigate any applicant and shall require the applicant to pay the actual cost of investigating the application as part of the fees and costs imposed pursuant to section 44-32-506. The applicant shall advance the money necessary for the investigation to the commission, and the commission shall return any unused portion of the money to the applicant at the conclusion of the commission’s investigation. The advance of the money may either be made directly to the commission or the money may be deposited into escrow in a manner approved by the commission.

       Every license issued under this article 32 shall specify the number of days the licensed race meet shall continue and the number of races per day. No license shall be granted to any individual who is not a bona fide resident of Colorado nor to any foreign corporation. Every applicant shall agree that, if granted a license under this article 32, the applicant will not thereafter sell, mortgage, or otherwise pledge or dispose of any of the assets listed and described on the application for a license or a renewal license without thirty days’ prior notice to the commission, which may approve or disapprove the disposition of assets upon good cause shown. The charter of all corporate applicants shall contain a provision that, when a cumulative ten percent or more of the voting stock of the corporation is to be sold, mortgaged, or otherwise pledged or transferred, thirty days’ prior notice shall be given to the commission. The corporation shall pay an investigation fee to the commission as part of the fees and costs imposed pursuant to section 44-32-506. The commission shall approve or disapprove of the disposition of the stock, upon good cause shown, within ninety days of the filing of a completed application for transfer. The commission has the power to ascertain if any capital stock of any corporate applicant or licensee is held with the intent to mislead or deceive the commission for an undisclosed principal. The involvement of an undisclosed principal shall be grounds for the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license.

A licensee so petitioning may be granted the right to lease and utilize any other licensee’s facilities for the term of the petitioning licensee’s annual permit or any portion thereof, but the grant shall not be construed to allow any licensee more days of racing in any year than are prescribed by this article 32.

       Section does not violate due process when commission does not promulgate rules to safeguard against arbitrary applications of powers in suspending licenses because the statute itself prescribes the range of penalties which can be imposed by the commission.

        Racing commission was not precluded from making financial irresponsibility grounds for discipline,

       even though such grounds were not enumerated in this section, since the rule was in the interests of the public and reasonable and was fully consistent with the commission’s authority to promulgate rules. Partridge v. State, 895 P.2d 1183 (Colo. App. 1995).

        Annotator’s note.
       </b>
       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The primary purpose of the extensive changes made in this article
       </b>
       was to confer upon the racing commission a broad discretionary power in granting or denying applications for race meets. Colo. Racing Comm’n v. Columbine Kennel Club, Inc., 141 Colo. 497, 348 P.2d 954 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        It seems a wise intendment on the part of the general assembly to forestall or prevent the commission from exercising favoritism among applicants
       </b>
       and making it impossible for the commission to issue licenses only to such applicants as might be in the favor of the commission, and reject others for no given reason. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        By the act, the commission is told what applications to reject,
       </b>
       and there is no room within the provisions of the act that allows an arbitrary or capricious action of the commission. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The general assembly by the employment of the word “shall” in connection with the issuance of a license, unquestionably intended
       </b>
       that such was to be put beyond the pale of permissive action on the part of the commission in cases where the applicant has met every requirement of the act in connection with its application, and does not fall within the specific prohibitions. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The prohibitions specifically contained in the act
       </b>
       are that no license shall be issued for the racing of horses or other animals within 40 miles of any other racing operation licensed under this law, and further, that the number and kind of race meets to be held in any one county in any one year shall be determined by the commission, provided that not more than two race meets for animals other than horses shall be licensed in any county in any one year, nor held for a duration longer than 30 days, and no race meets shall be conducted on any Sunday. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The act provides not only the eligibility for applicants for a license, but distinctly sets out what may be considered ineligible applicants,
       </b>
       and therefore, the use of the word “shall” is a clear indication that, in the consideration of applications that meet every requirement when a third person as well as the state of Colorado has an interest in the exercise of the duty of the commission, the exercise of the power is then imperative. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        So far as the commission is concerned the act provides that it is legal to have as many tracks as the 40-mile limit will not prevent,
       </b>
       so long as there is not more than one in each county. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        If the commission can say that an application for license should be rejected because it is 45 miles from another track
       </b>
       when it is provided in the act, not within 40 miles of another track, then there are no bounds to the discretion of the commission, and it could refuse a license on the basis of 50, 75, or 100 miles, or any other distance it might see fit to state. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Where the commission considered the “best interests” of racing, and of the state, would not be served by granting the license,
       </b>
       there being sufficient evidence to support this finding, it should have been upheld by the trial court. Colo. Racing Comm’n v. Columbine Kennel Club, Inc., 141 Colo. 497, 348 P.2d 954 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In this section it is provided that after the first year of the operation of a track, and there have been no violations committed by the operator,
       </b>
       the commission shall renew the particular license upon application and grant the same time it had in the preceding year. Cloverleaf Kennel Club v. Racing Comm’n, 130 Colo. 505, 277 P.2d 226 (1954).

       </b>
       The following annotations include cases decided under former provisions similar to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Statutes authorizing pari-mutuel betting on racing events are valid over the contention that such betting constituted a lottery.
       </b>
       Ginsberg v. Centennial Turf Club, Inc., 126 Colo. 471, 251 P.2d 926 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Pari-mutuel betting upon horse and dog races did not offend against the former constitutional provision
       </b>
       which provided that the general assembly “shall have no power to authorize lotteries or gift enterprises for any purpose, and shall pass laws to prohibit the sale of lottery or gift enterprise tickets in this state”. Ginsberg v. Centennial Turf Club, Inc., 126 Colo. 471, 251 P.2d 926 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In an action involving the disposition of funds collected in connection with horse racing, it was held on review
       </b>
       that a licensee shall collect and retain the breakage. Centennial Turf Club, Inc. v. Colo. Racing Comm’n, 129 Colo. 529, 271 P.2d 1046 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The general assembly took time out to specify and direct to whom the underpayments should be made, that is, to the state,
       </b>
       and it could have easily included the breakage if such was its intention. Centennial Turf Club, Inc. v. Colo. Racing Comm’n, 129 Colo. 529, 271 P.2d 1046 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The track is not quasi-trustee of the breakage, because there is no beneficiary stated
       </b>
       in the section and certainly it is not trustee for the wagerers because the section clearly indicates that the breakage does not go to the wagerers, but it authorizes a withholding of the odd pennies therefrom, and it cannot be trustee for the state because the section does not say that the state is entitled to this breakage. Centennial Turf Club, Inc. v. Colo. Racing Comm’n, 129 Colo. 529, 271 P.2d 1046 (1954).

       with respect to plaintiff’s claims that lottery division and lottery commission knew that the last grand prize for a particular scratch game had been claimed, continued to sell tickets for the scratch game, did not inform potential ticket purchasers that the grand prize was no longer available, and continued to represent the availability of the grand prize. Subsections (3)(m) and (3)(o) are general in nature and did not establish that plaintiff’s claims, if true, would constitute lottery statute violations for which plaintiff could seek administrative remedies.

        Exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required by this section
       </b>
       with respect to plaintiff’s claims that lottery division and lottery commission knew that the last grand prize for a particular scratch game had been claimed, continued to sell tickets for the scratch game, did not inform potential ticket purchasers that the grand prize was no longer available, and continued to represent the availability of the grand prize. This language of the introductory portion to subsection (1) is general in nature and did not establish that plaintiff’s claims, if true, would constitute lottery statute violations for which plaintiff could seek administrative remedies.
