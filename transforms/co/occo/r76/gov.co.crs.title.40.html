The MMO may retain any portion of the adjustments that rightfully belongs to the MMO. Upon the expiration of the ninety-day claims period, the MMO shall identify any such adjustments that are unclaimed and, if the aggregate amount unclaimed exceeds one hundred dollars, the MMO shall contribute the unclaimed amount to the fund established by the legislative commission on low-income energy and water assistance pursuant to section 40-8.5-104.

In adopting rules, the commission shall consider Colorado’s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and the need to electrify buildings, transportation, and other commercial and industrial sectors to meet those goals. The commission shall also consider rules that would encourage landlords to bear the attendant costs and to retain at least a portion of the resulting benefits in addition to any other incentives the commission finds appropriate.

      In order to promote improved transportation for the elderly, for persons with disabilities, and for the residents of rural areas and small towns through an expanded and coordinated transportation network, the general assembly hereby declares it to be the policy of the state to legally define and to recognize people service transportation and volunteer transportation as separate but contributing components of the transportation system. Therefore, it is the policy of the state to remove barriers to low-cost people service transportation and volunteer transportation. For this purpose, transportation systems meeting the criteria prescribed in this article will not be classified as public utilities or as any form of carrier subject to regulation by the commission but as people service transportation and volunteer transportation subject to appropriate regulation and administration.

In addition, the executive director of the department of revenue shall, in consultation with the director of the commission, enter into an agreement with each nonprofit generation and transmission electric corporation or association whereby such entity agrees to pay an amount equal to the administrative expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the commission for the regulation of such entity. Said agreement shall be made by May 1 of the year in which it is to become effective and shall remain effective for not less than two and not more than five years. In the event that the anticipated amount set forth in the agreement proves to be substantially higher or lower than the commission’s actual expenses incurred, the agreement for the next following year or years shall be adjusted so as to take such fact into account. If no such agreement is made as provided in this subsection (2), the commission, on its own motion or upon application by the executive director of the department of revenue or by such entity, shall set the matter for hearing and determine the amount to be paid by the entity. Amounts paid under agreements as contemplated by this subsection (2) or by order of the commission shall be used to reduce amounts paid by other utilities under subsection (1) of this section.

       The general assembly finds, determines, and declares that natural gas service is essential to the health and well-being of all Colorado natural gas customers. The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that natural gas is traded in competitive markets at the wellhead and in downstream markets for sale to utilities, industrial customers, and large commercial customers and there may be the potential for natural gas also to be traded competitively for sale to all other classes of consumers. As a result, it may be predicted that competition in the natural gas supply market may increase the choices available to consumers and reduce the price of such service. Accordingly, it is the policy of the state of Colorado to encourage competition after a reasonable transition period during which consumers are educated about choices in natural gas supply that are now available or will be available in the future. The commission is authorized to approve voluntary plans consistent with this section that separate the sale of natural gas to retail customers into natural gas delivery and natural gas supply and, after a transition period, deregulate the charge for natural gas supply where the commission finds that the plan provides customers with adequate choices, ensures the provision of reliable natural gas supply on a fallback basis on terms and conditions that are just and reasonable to all customers, promotes the development of a competitive market for gas supply, limits the unreasonable exercise of market power, and retains and enhances programs to support low-income consumers.

       Each provider of retail electric service in the state of Colorado, other than municipally owned utilities that serve forty thousand customers or fewer, is a qualifying retail utility. Each qualifying retail utility, with the exception of cooperative electric associations that have voted to exempt themselves from commission jurisdiction pursuant to section 40-9.5-104 and municipally owned utilities, is subject to the rules established under this article 2 by the commission. No additional regulatory authority is provided to the commission other than that specifically contained in this section. In accordance with article 4 of title 24, the commission shall revise or clarify existing rules to establish the following:

       Editor’s note:
      </b>
      (1) A declaration of intent was contained in the initiated measure, Amendment 37, and is reproduced below:
      Energy is critically important to Colorado’s welfare and development, and its use has a profound impact on the economy and environment. Growth of the state’s population and economic base will continue to create a need for new energy resources, and Colorado’s renewable energy resources are currently underutilized. Therefore, in order to save consumers and businesses money, attract new businesses and jobs, promote development of rural economies, minimize water use for electricity generation, diversify Colorado’s energy resources, reduce the impact of volatile fuel prices, and improve the natural environment of the state, it is in the best interests of the citizens of Colorado to develop and utilize renewable energy resources to the maximum practicable extent.
      (2) This initiated measure was approved by a vote of the registered electors of the state of Colorado on November 2, 2004. The vote count for the measure was as follows:
      :u360 FOR: :u1080 1,066,023
      :u360 AGAINST: :u1080 922,577
      (3) Amendments to subsection IP(1)(a) by SB 21-261 and HB 21-1052 were harmonized.
      (4) Section 14 of chapter 220 (SB 21-272), Session Laws of Colorado 2021, provides that the act changing this section applies to conduct occurring on or after June 10, 2021.
      (5) Section 7 of chapter 280 ( SB 21-261), Session Laws of Colorado 2021, provides that the act changing this section applies to contracts for distributed generation and energy storage facilities executed on or after June 21, 2021.

      (1) A declaration of intent was contained in the initiated measure, Amendment 37, and is reproduced below:
      Energy is critically important to Colorado’s welfare and development, and its use has a profound impact on the economy and environment. Growth of the state’s population and economic base will continue to create a need for new energy resources, and Colorado’s renewable energy resources are currently underutilized. Therefore, in order to save consumers and businesses money, attract new businesses and jobs, promote development of rural economies, minimize water use for electricity generation, diversify Colorado’s energy resources, reduce the impact of volatile fuel prices, and improve the natural environment of the state, it is in the best interests of the citizens of Colorado to develop and utilize renewable energy resources to the maximum practicable extent.
      (2) This initiated measure was approved by a vote of the registered electors of the state of Colorado on November 2, 2004. The vote count for the measure was as follows:
      :u360 FOR: :u1080 1,066,023

        Commission has two duties.
       </b>
       The commission has been charged with the duty to carry out its mission in two areas, to wit: To protect the public and to prevent destructive rate-making which could result in nonavailability of the service to the public.

        Duty of commission to protect public interest.

        Preferential rate-making restricted.
       </b>
       Although the PUC has been granted broad rate-making powers by art. XXV, Colo. Const., the commission’s power to effect social policy through preferential rate-making is restricted by § 40-3-106 (1) and this section, no matter how deserving the group benefiting from the preferential rate may be.

        Right of utility customer to receive service is not absolute right,
       </b>
       but is a qualified right. The right is dependent upon payment for the service and product provided. The continuation of service during a dispute is dependent upon either the posting of what is, in effect, an indemnity bond or the assertion of a well-founded claim that would justify the customer’s refusal to pay for the service which was rendered. Denver Welfare Rights Org. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 190 Colo. 329, 547 P.2d 239 (1976).

        Commission’s power to impose accelerated depreciation on utility.

        Rates set by commission for interLATA access charge and intraLATA toll rates do not unreasonably discriminate against resellers and result in “price squeeze”.
       </b>
       When establishing an intraLATA toll rate, the commission is under no obligation to require a Bell operating company to impute to itself an access charge similar to one imposed on resellers. Wholesale rates approved by commission and charged to resellers for intraLATA toll services are not discriminatory, even though in some mileage bands and at some times of the day such rates exceed the retail rates charged by the Bell operating company to its own customers. Consumer Counsel v. P.U.C., 786 P.2d 1086 (Colo. 1990) (decided under the “Intrastate Telecommunication Service Act”, § 40-15-101 et seq., as it existed prior to its 1987 repeal and reenactment, which act provided that intraLATA toll services were governed by the doctrine of regulated monopoly and which did not provide for a prohibition against discriminatory charges).

      <li id="t40a03s40-3-103.5ol11">
       Notwithstanding any provision of articles 1 to 7 of this title 40 to the contrary, the commission shall adopt rules to create an exemption from any tiered electricity rate plan based on a customer’s medical condition. The commission’s rules must provide a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with implementing and providing the medical exemption.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a03s40-3-103.5ol12">
       The commission may determine the definition of “medical condition”; except that the definition must include multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, quadriplegia, and paraplegia. The medical exemption is for individuals who have the verification of a physician licensed in Colorado of a heat-sensitive medical condition or the need for the use of an essential life support device.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a03s40-3-103.5ol13">
       If the commission determines that a means test is necessary for the medical exemption, the commission shall use no less than four hundred percent of the federal poverty level for the customer’s household as the maximum income to be eligible for the medical exemption.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a03s40-3-103.5ol14">
       If the low-income energy assistance program is used to certify eligibility, the medical exemption under this section must be distinguishable from the heat assistance benefits offered under the low-income energy assistance program because these programs may have different eligibility requirements.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a03s40-3-103.5ol15">
       On and after September 1, 2020, the commission shall require utilities periodically to report, pursuant to section 40-3-110, the number of their customers who receive the medical exemption under this section and to describe the efforts the utilities have made during each reporting period to facilitate the enrollment of qualified persons in their medical exemption programs.

        Rates set by commission for interLATA access charge and intraLATA toll rates do not unreasonably discriminate against resellers and result in “price squeeze”.
       </b>
       When establishing an intraLATA toll rate, the commission is under no obligation to require a Bell operating company to impute to itself an access charge similar to one imposed on resellers. Wholesale rates approved by commission and charged to resellers for intraLATA toll services are not discriminatory, even though in some mileage bands and at some times of the day such rates exceed the retail rates charged by the Bell operating company to its own customers. Consumer Counsel v. P.U.C., 786 P.2d 1086 (Colo. 1990) (decided under the “Intrastate Telecommunication Service Act”, § 40-15-101 et seq., as it existed prior to its 1987 repeal and reenactment, which act provided that intraLATA toll services were governed by the doctrine of regulated monopoly and which did not provide for a prohibition against discriminatory charges).

        Limiting the discretion of the PUC

       in determining how a privately-owned fixed public utility will be allowed to recover the cost of franchise fees, pursuant to subsection (4), is not a matter within the domain of local self-government and does not fall within the scope of protection of § 35 of article V of the Colorado constitution.City of Montrose v.

       Subsection (4) does not impermissibly impose a new liability upon a city’s residents in violation of § 12 of article XV of the Colorado constitution as this section does not require that municipal customers be surcharged for the amount surcharged to and paid by rural customers for franchise fees prior to adoption of this section, and an increase in surcharges after the statutory enactment is not a new liability within the meaning of § 12, article XV. City of Montrose v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 732 P.2d 1181 (Colo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (4) does not affect either a home rule city’s ability to negotiate and grant franchises and to collect franchise fees or a fixed utility’s obligation to pay to a municipality the entire amount of the franchise fee negotiated and, therefore, does not violate §§ 4 and 6 of article XX or article XXV of the Colorado constitution. City of Montrose v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 732 P.2d 1181 (Colo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (4), which requires that a fixed public utility be ordered to increase rates charged customers in a municipality by adding a surcharge to recover the amount paid to the municipality under a franchise or license, does not violate article XXV of the Colorado constitution as said section is a legislative restriction on the authority of the commission as authorized by article XXV. City of Montrose v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 732 P.2d 1181 (Colo. 1987).

       <b>
        Using the rational basis analysis,
       </b>
       the general assembly could have reasonably concluded that subsection (4) would be a disincentive for municipalities to negotiate inflated franchise fees since such a fee will ultimately be paid for by the residents of the municipality.

        The right of home rule cities to grant franchises

      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that cost-effective natural gas and electricity demand-side management programs will save money for consumers and utilities and protect Colorado’s environment. The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that providing funding mechanisms to encourage Colorado’s public utilities to reduce emissions or air pollutants and to increase energy efficiency are matters of statewide concern and that the public interest is served by providing such funding mechanisms. Such efforts will result in an improvement in the quality of life and health of Colorado citizens and an increase in the attractiveness of Colorado as a place to live and conduct business.

       A public utility shall be entitled to fully recover from its retail customers the air quality improvement costs that it prudently incurs as a result of a voluntary agreement entered into pursuant to part 12 of article 7 of title 25, C.R.S., after July 1, 1998, except as provided in subsection (7) of this section.

       For the purposes of this article, “air quality improvement costs” means the incremental life-cycle costs including capital, operating, maintenance, fuel, and financing costs incurred or to be incurred by a public utility at electric generating facilities located in Colorado. To account for the timing differences between various costs and revenue recovery, life-cycle costs shall be calculated using net present value analysis.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a3.2p01s40-3.2-102ol13">
       Upon application by a public utility for cost recovery, the commission shall determine an appropriate method of cost recovery that assures full cost recovery for the public utility. The air quality improvement costs recovered by the public utility shall not cause an average rate impact greater than the equivalent of one and one-half mills per kilowatt hour in any period, nor shall such costs exceed a total of two hundred eleven million dollars calculated using 1998 net present value dollars. The air quality improvement costs for a generating facility shall be recovered over a period of fifteen years or less.

       Any revenues a public utility receives from transferring, selling, banking, or otherwise using allowances established under Title IV of the federal “Clean Air Act” or under any other trading program of regional or national applicability shall be credited to the public utility’s customers to offset air quality improvement costs if such revenues are a result of a voluntary agreement entered into under part 12 of article 7 of title 25, C.R.S.

       To the extent that a voluntary agreement entered into under part 12 of article 7 of title 25, C.R.S., does not increase the public utility’s electric generating capacity, the voluntary agreement shall not be subject to any restrictions that arise from the commission’s integrated resources planning rules.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a3.2p01s40-3.2-102ol16">
       The commission shall assure that any future industry restructuring does not adversely affect the ability of the public utility to recover its air quality improvement costs.

The public utilities commission may assign a portion of the air quality improvement costs to the public utility’s wholesale customers to the extent that such portion of such cost recovery does not conflict with the public utility’s wholesale contracts entered into prior to April 1, 1998.

         If the public utilities commission assigns a portion of the public utility’s air quality improvement costs to be recovered from the public utility’s wholesale customers, the public utility may apply to the federal energy regulatory commission for recovery, effective on the date of filing, of the portion of costs assigned to the public utility’s wholesale customers. The public utilities commission shall permit the public utility to recover the portion of costs assigned to the public utility’s wholesale customers from its retail customers pending the federal energy regulatory commission’s approval of recovery from the public utility’s wholesale customers.

       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the federal “Clean Air Act”, 42 U.S.C. sec. 7401 et seq., will likely require reductions in emissions from coal-fired power plants operated by rate-regulated utilities in Colorado. A coordinated plan of emission reductions from these coal-fired power plants will enable Colorado rate-regulated utilities to meet the requirements of the federal act and protect public health and the environment at a lower cost than a piecemeal approach. A coordinated plan of reduction of emissions for Colorado’s rate-regulated utilities will also result in reductions in many air pollutants and promote the use of natural gas and other low-emitting resources to meet Colorado’s electricity needs, which will in turn promote development of Colorado’s economy and industry.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a3.2p02s40-3.2-202ol12">
       The general assembly further finds that the use of natural gas to reduce coal-fired emissions may require rate-regulated utilities to enter into long-term contracts for natural gas in a manner that protects electricity consumers. Even though such long-term contracts might be beneficial to consumers, financial rating agencies could find that such long-term contracts increase the financial risk to rate-regulated utilities, which in turn could increase the cost of capital to these utilities. The general assembly finds that it is important to give financial markets confidence that utilities will be able to recover the costs of long-term gas contracts without the risk of future regulators disallowing contracts.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a3.2p02s40-3.2-202ol13">
       The general assembly further finds and declares that Colorado rate-regulated utilities require timely and forward-looking reviews of their costs of providing utility service in order to undertake the comprehensive and extensive planning and changes to their business operations contemplated by this part 2. In order to allow these utilities to continue to provide reliable electric service, alter their operations in the manner described by this part 2, and meet other state public policy goals, it is imperative that Colorado rate-regulated utilities continue in sound financial condition and remain attractive investments so that sufficient capital is provided to achieve the state’s goals. To that end, the general assembly finds that the commission should have additional tools and more flexibility in its regulatory authority to ensure the continued financial health of these utilities. The general assembly also finds and declares that the actions provided for in this part 2 be implemented in a manner to address the sound economic, health, and environmental conditions of energy producing communities.

       Connection of noncompetitive lines - costs and rates apportioned.

     <p>
      Whenever the commission, after a hearing upon its own motion or upon complaint, finds that a physical connection can reasonably be made between the lines of two or more noncompetitive telephone public utilities whose lines can be made to form a continuous line of communication by the construction and maintenance of suitable connections for the transmission of messages or conversations and that the public convenience and necessity will be served or finds that two or more telephone public utilities have failed to establish joint rates, tolls, or charges for service by or over said lines and that joint rates, tolls, or charges ought to be established, the commission may by its order require that such connections be made and that conversations be transmitted and messages transferred over such connection under such rules as the commission may establish and prescribe through lines and joint rates, tolls, and charges to be made and used, observed, and in force in the future. If such telephone public utilities do not agree upon the division between them of the joint cost of the physical connection or connections or the division of the joint rates, tolls, or charges established by the commission over such through lines, the commission has authority, after further hearing, to establish the division by supplemental order.

If such use is directed, the public utility to whom the use is permitted shall be liable to the owner or other users of such conduits, subways, tracks, wires, poles, pipes, other equipment, or railroad right-of-way, for such damage as may result therefrom to the property of such owners or other users thereof.

The requirement of notice and hearing in this section is deemed to have been complied with by the commission’s giving notice of and holding a hearing upon the question of whether any such signals or devices are required at any crossing; but in such cases the notice shall state that the question of how the costs will be borne and paid will be considered at and determined as a result of the hearing for which the notice is given. This paragraph (b) shall not apply to any grade crossing when all or any part of the cost of the installation, reconstruction, or improvement of the signals or devices at the crossing will be paid from funds available under any federal or federal-aid highway act.

         The general assembly finds and determines that:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aI">
           Fourteen communities in Colorado, known as the “Ready for 100” communities, have committed to obtaining one hundred percent renewable energy by 2025 to 2035. In addition, thirty-five communities, known as “Colorado Communities for Climate Action”, have organized to advocate for stronger climate change policies. These communities, which represent more than one million Coloradans, are exploring ways to reach their energy and climate goals within their desired time periods.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aII">
           A key element of the governor’s policy initiative, entitled “Roadmap to 100% Renewable Energy by 2040 and Bold Climate Action”, prioritizes supporting local commitments to one hundred percent renewable energy.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aIII">
           The ability of a community to achieve its energy goals is currently limited by the energy supply and the decarbonization timeline of the electric utility that serves that community’s geographic area. The ability to procure electricity from alternative wholesale suppliers may enable communities to achieve their energy goals faster and more cost-effectively.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aIV">
           Community choice energy or CCE, also commonly known as community choice aggregation or CCA, is a local energy model that a number of states have adopted and that has proven to be effective in helping communities achieve their renewable energy goals, cost-containment goals, or both. A robust study of CCE would answer key questions and illuminate the possible benefits and challenges of adapting the CCE model as an option for Colorado communities.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aV">
           In the CCE model, communities that are served by an investor-owned electric utility may choose their wholesale electricity suppliers, while the electricity continues to be delivered by the incumbent investor-owned electric utility. In states that have enabled CCE to date, CCE is not permitted in communities that are served by a cooperative electric association or a municipally owned electric utility.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aVI">
           In the CCE model, an investor-owned electric utility continues to own and operate its transmission and distribution system to serve both CCE customers and its own customers, and the utility continues to provide metering and billing services, manage customer service, and implement demand-side management programs. The utility continues to own and operate its power generation assets to serve its own customers. If a community chooses to adopt CCE, the utility would deliver the electricity, with appropriate compensation, from one or more alternative suppliers to CCE customers.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aVII">
           This section concerns the “wholesale, opt-out” model of CCE, pursuant to which individual customers are automatically enrolled in and retain the right to opt out of their community’s CCE offerings and purchase their electricity from the utility under its traditional bundled service. By contrast, the retail model of CCE, in which individuals in deregulated retail choice states can shop for their electricity from among many competing suppliers, does not promote the stable revenue conditions needed for development of high levels of renewable energy. The retail CCE model is explicitly not the subject of this section.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aVIII">
           A well-designed wholesale, opt-out CCE program would introduce an element of wholesale competition and community-level choice into the supply of electricity and could provide communities that have ambitious renewable energy goals, cost-containment goals, or both, with a means to reach those goals more quickly and cost-effectively.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aIX">
           This section pertains only to the study of CCE, not to its implementation. While CCE in other states shows the potential for communities to make local energy decisions, reach their energy goals, reduce energy costs, and foster local economic development and local employment, it is prudent to first study the feasibility and the regulatory, legal, and environmental implications of CCE in Colorado before considering the implementation of CCE as an option for communities in Colorado that are served by an investor-owned electric utility.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aX">
           The study of CCE as described in this section will answer key questions about the potential viability of CCE in Colorado and will identify best practices and lessons learned from the experiences of states that have already implemented CCE. The study will provide the information needed to determine whether CCE could provide net benefits to Colorado communities.
          </li>
          <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11aXI">
           CCE, if enabled in Colorado in the future, could promote a more vibrant and competitive wholesale electricity market and could enhance efforts to form or join a regional transmission organization, which could increase the footprint of energy trading in the west and thereby reduce costs through market efficiency, lower required reserve capacities, increased integration of cost-effective renewable energy, and decreased curtailment of excess renewable energy. A regional transmission organization could also potentially benefit cooperative electric associations and municipal electric utilities.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t40a04s40-4-120ol11b">
         Therefore, the general assembly declares that it is in the public interest to direct the commission to evaluate the viability of the wholesale, opt-out model of CCE in Colorado and to answer key questions about CCE in Colorado by conducting an investigatory docket that considers at least the topics outlined in subsection (3) of this section.

       Definition.   As used in this section, “community choice energy” or “CCE” means a mechanism that allows cities, including a city and county, counties, or groups of cities and counties to combine their purchasing power and choose one or more alternative wholesale electricity suppliers on behalf of the residents, businesses, and municipal facilities in the jurisdiction while the incumbent investor-owned electric utility maintains its existing generation and continues to own and operate its transmission and distribution system and deliver the electricity to both its own customers and CCE customers.

         A public utility shall not begin the construction of a new facility, plant, or system or the extension of its facility, plant, or system without first obtaining from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require, or will require, the construction or extension. For purposes of this subsection (1), the present or future public convenience and necessity does not include the consideration of land use rights or siting issues related to the location or alignment of the proposed electric transmission lines or associated facilities, which issues are under the jurisdiction of a local government’s land use regulation. Sections 40-5-101 to 40-5-104 do not require a corporation to secure a certificate for the following:

       Whenever the commission, after a hearing upon its own motion or upon complaint, finds that there is or will be a duplication of service by public utilities in any area, the commission may issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity assigning specific territories to one or to each of said utilities or, by certificate of public convenience and necessity, otherwise define the conditions of rendering service and constructing extensions within those territories and may order the elimination of the duplication upon such terms as are just and reasonable, having due regard to due process of law and to all the rights of the respective parties and to public convenience and necessity.

Nothing in this subsection (3) prohibits a local government from granting a variance from its zoning rules, resolutions, or ordinances for such uses of the property. Nothing in this subsection (3) grants the commission any additional authority to restrict a siting application. For purposes of this section, “local government” means a county, home rule or statutory city, town, territorial charter city, or city and county. Nothing in this subsection (3) restricts the right of a public utility or power authority to appeal to the public utilities commission a local government action under section 29-20-108, C.R.S.

The transmission rate adjustment clause is subject to annual changes, which are effective on January 1 of each year.

         To provide additional encouragement to utilities to pursue the construction and expansion of transmission facilities, the commission shall approve current recovery by the utility through the annual rate adjustment clause of the utility’s weighted average cost of capital, including its most recently authorized rate of return on equity, on the total balance of construction work in progress related to such transmission facilities as of the end of the immediately preceding year. The rate adjustment clause shall be reduced to the extent that the prudently incurred costs being recovered through the adjustment clause have been included in the public utility’s base rates as a result of the commission’s final order in a rate case.

       Before any certificate may issue under sections 40-5-101 to 40-5-104, a certified copy of its articles of incorporation or charter, if the applicant is a corporation, shall be filed in the office of the commission. Every applicant for a certificate to exercise franchise rights under section 40-5-102 shall file in the office of the commission such evidence as shall be required by the commission to show that such applicant has received the required consent, franchise, permit, ordinance, vote, or other authority of the proper county, city and county, or municipal or other public authority. The commission has the power to issue a certificate to exercise franchise rights after hearing, to refuse to issue the same, or to issue it for the partial exercise only of said right or privilege and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by such certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. Nothing contained in this subsection (1) shall be construed to limit or restrict the power and authority of the commission: To regulate, issue, or refuse to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for construction of a new facility, plant, or system or of any extension thereof as provided in section 40-5-101; and to attach to the exercise of the rights granted by such certificate such terms and conditions as in the commission’s judgment may be required by the public convenience and necessity.

The commission may thereupon make an order declaring that it will thereafter, upon application, under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe issue the desired certificate upon such terms and conditions as it may designate after such public utility has obtained the contemplated franchise, permit, ordinance, vote, or other authority. Upon the presentation to the commission of evidence satisfactory to it that such franchise, permit, ordinance, vote, or other authority has been secured by such public utility, the commission shall thereupon issue such certificate.

For this purpose, any administrative law judge, as provided in this title, shall be deemed to be a hearing commissioner as that term is used in said article 4 of title 24, C.R.S. The commission may from time to time make or amend such general rules or orders as may be requisite for the order and regulation of proceedings before it, or before any individual commissioner or administrative law judge, including forms of notices and the service thereof. Any party to the proceeding may appear before the commission or any individual commissioner or administrative law judge and be heard.

The commission may by order at any time amend, modify, supplement, or rescind any such assignment or reference.

       The Colorado general assembly has bestowed broad powers upon the public utilities commission (PUC). Public utilities, even though privately financed and owned, operating pursuant to the regulation of the commission, are granted existence by virtue of state law, and thereafter carry on business under color of state law.

       </b>
       There is express authority throughout the statute governing procedures before the PUC for hearings to be conducted before the full commission, or before any one commissioner or any examiner of the commission. The presumption of reading and considering is merely one facet of the general presumption of regularity, which supports the official acts of public officers and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.

No subpoena shall be issued except upon good cause shown. Good cause shown shall consist of an affidavit stating with specificity the testimony, records, or documents sought and the relevance of such testimony, records, or documents to the proceedings of the commission.

Any witness subpoenaed except one whose fees and mileage may be paid from the funds of the commission, at the time of service, may demand the fees to which the witness is entitled for travel to and from the place at which the witness is required to appear, and one day’s attendance. If such witness demands such fees at the time of service, and they are not at that time paid or tendered, the witness shall not be required to attend, as directed in the subpoena.

The commission, individual commissioner, or an administrative law judge before whom the testimony is to be given or produced, in case of the failure or refusal of any witness to attend or testify or produce any records or documents required by such subpoena, may report to the district court in and for the county or city and county in which the proceeding is pending, by petition, setting forth that due notice has been given of the time and place of attendance of said witness or the production of said records or documents, that the witness has been subpoenaed in the manner prescribed in this title, and that the witness has failed or refused to attend or produce the records or documents required by the subpoena or has failed or refused to answer questions propounded to the witness in the course of such proceeding; and the commission, individual commissioner, or an administrative law judge may ask for an order of the court compelling the witness to attend and testify or produce or cause to be produced documentary evidence. No person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury in the first degree committed by such person in this testimony. Nothing in this section shall be construed as in any manner giving to any public utility immunity of any kind.

        Abbreviated hearing procedure permitted.
       </b>
       Where the commission believes that an economic emergency may exist, and it may permit new rates to become effective without a hearing, participatory values are better served by allowing the commission to conduct a hearing with abbreviated procedures and a limitation on the issues to be considered. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 653 P.2d 1117 (Colo. 1982).

       <b>
        New rates not held invalid.
       </b>
       There was no merit to the contention that new rates were invalid because the PUC, in not suspending them, improperly permitted them to go into effect without any hearing. Such discretion is delegated to the PUC by the general assembly in § 40-3-104, and the discretionary power to suspend is set forth in this section. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v.

        A federal court may not intervene where the commission suspends rates on an interim basis

        Effect of failure by party to file transcript.
       </b>
       If a party who seeks to reverse, modify, or annul a recommended decision of a commission examiner or the decision of the commission fails to file a transcript, the basic findings of fact of the commission are conclusively presumed to be complete and accurate. Howard v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 187 Colo. 138, 528 P.2d 1303 (1974).

        The commission may rely on evidence other than that obtained at a formal hearing;
       </b>
       thus the commission is allowed to consider a broader range of information in making an adjudicatory decision than that allowed by strict application of § 24-4-105 (14) of the State Administrative Procedure Act. Colo. Energy Advocacy v. Pub. Serv. Co., 704 P.2d 298 (Colo. 1985).

        While subsection (6) does not generally require the commission to include advisory memoranda as part of the record,

       when staff injects new factual information into the proceedings through an advisory memorandum read at the open meeting deliberation of the commissioners and this factual information has not otherwise been made part of the record, the commission must include such factual information in the record for purposes of judicial review under § 40-6-115.

       After a decision has been made by the commission or after a decision recommended by an individual commissioner or administrative law judge has become the decision of the commission, as provided in this article, any party thereto may within twenty days thereafter, or within such additional time as the commission may authorize upon request made within such period, make application for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of the same or of any matter determined therein. Such application shall be governed by such general rules as the commission may establish and shall specify with particularity the grounds upon which the applicant considers the decision unlawful. Any such application shall, within thirty days after the filing thereof, be considered and acted upon by the commission. Failure to act upon the application within such period shall constitute a denial thereof. Rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration may be granted if sufficient reason therefor is shown.

Any decision made after rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration, reversing, changing, or modifying the original decision may be subject to the same provisions with respect to rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration as an original decision or any such decision may be subject to judicial review as provided in section 40-6-115, at the option of the party seeking review. If the commission denies said application, the original order shall become effective according to its terms, unless the commission otherwise orders, except as provided in section 40-6-116.

       <b>
        Action on application for rehearing is limited to grant or denial.
       </b>
       It is clear from the wording of this section that, in passing upon an application for rehearing, the permissible affirmative action of the commission does not go further than to grant or deny the application. Snell v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 108 Colo. 162, 114 P.2d 563 (1941).

        The public utilities commission (PUC) acts without authority when it attempts to amend or modify an order duly entered
       </b>
       as a part of its action in passing upon an application for a rehearing of such order. Rescission, alteration, or amendment of orders must be upon notice to the public utility affected, and after opportunity to be heard, as provided in § 40-6-112. Snell v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 108 Colo. 162, 114 P.2d 563 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        However, commission need not state conclusion that original order unjust.
       </b>
       Subsection (3) provides that if, after rehearing, “the commission shall be of the opinion that the original order...is in any respect unjust or unwarranted, or should be changed, the commission may abrogate, change or modify the same”. To deny an application for expanded authority on rehearing after an order granting such authority, the PUC would necessarily have to conclude that the original order was unjust or unwarranted, and it would seem to be a useless thing to require that to be stated. Denver Clean-Up Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 174 Colo. 329, 483 P.2d 974 (1971).

      <p>
       <b>
        Upon denial of application, order becomes final.

       Within thirty days after a final decision by the commission in any proceeding, any party to the proceeding before the commission may apply to the district court for a writ of certiorari or review for the purpose of having the lawfulness of the final decision inquired into and determined. Such writ shall be made returnable not later than thirty days after the date of issuance and shall direct the commission to certify its record in the proceeding to said court. On the return day, the cause shall be heard by the district court unless, for a good reason shown, the same be continued. No new or additional evidence may be introduced in the district court, but the cause shall be heard on the record of the commission as certified by it. The commission and each party to the action or proceeding before the commission shall have the right to appear in the review proceedings.

       The findings and conclusions of the commission on disputed questions of fact shall be final and shall not be subject to review, except that, in any proceeding wherein the validity of any order or decision is challenged on the ground that it violates any right of a petitioner under the constitution of the United States or the constitution of the state of Colorado, the district court shall exercise an independent judgment on the law and the facts, and the findings or conclusions of the commission material to the determination of the said constitutional question shall not be final.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a06s40-6-115ol13">
       Upon review, the district court shall enter judgment either affirming, setting aside, or modifying the decision of the commission. So far as necessary to the decision and where presented, the district court shall decide all relevant questions of law and interpret all relevant constitutional and statutory provisions. The review shall not extend further than to determine whether the commission has regularly pursued its authority, including a determination of whether the decision under review violates any right of the petitioner under the constitution of the United States or of the state of Colorado, and whether the decision of the commission is just and reasonable and whether its conclusions are in accordance with the evidence.
      </li>

       The provisions of the Colorado rules of civil procedure relating to writs of certiorari or review, so far as applicable and not in conflict with the provisions of this title, shall apply to proceedings had in the district court under the provisions of this section. No court of this state, except the district court to the extent specified, shall have jurisdiction to review, reverse, correct, or annul any order or decision of the commission, or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof, or to enjoin, restrain, or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties; but an action in the nature of mandamus shall lie from the district court to the commission in all proper cases.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a06s40-6-115ol15">
       All actions for review shall be commenced and tried in the district court in and for the county in which the petitioner resides, or if a corporation or partnership in the county in which it maintains its principal office or place of business, or in the district court of the city and county of Denver, at the option of the petitioner. Appellate review may be obtained in the supreme court concerning any final judgment of the district court on review, affirming, setting aside, or modifying any decision of the commission, in the same manner and with the same effect as appellate review of judgments of the district court in other civil actions.

        Judicial review of a PUC decision involves the issue of whether or not a PUC decision is supported by adequate evidence and whether its order, particularly when there is disputed evidence, is supported by findings of fact.

All public utilities affected shall be entitled to be heard and to introduce evidence at such hearing. The commission is empowered to resort to any other source of information available. The evidence introduced at such hearing shall be reduced to writing and certified under the seal of the commission. The commission shall make and file its findings of fact in writing upon all matters concerning which evidence has been introduced before it which in its judgment have bearing on the value of the property of the public utility affected.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In enacting this article 8.5, the general assembly finds and declares that there is a need to make distributions of money to provide aid and assistance to the indigent, the elderly, and persons with disabilities, who do not otherwise have the financial resources to meet their heating and other energy needs. The general assembly further finds and declares that the low-income energy assistance program of the department of human services is the most appropriate entity to determine those most in need of such aid and assistance. Therefore, this article 8.5 authorizes the legislative commission on low-income energy and water assistance to establish a fund from which to collect and distribute money to accomplish the goals set forth in this section. The money for the fund must be funded in part by unclaimed utility deposits.

       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that, in order to serve the best interests of the citizens of Colorado and, in particular, to aid low-income citizens of Colorado, there is a need for an energy assistance program to collect an optional low-income energy assistance contribution from utility customers in Colorado.

       The general assembly further finds that the most efficient way to support such a program is for gas and electric utilities to provide the opportunity for each utility customer to contribute an optional amount on the customer’s billing statement for low-income energy assistance that will be displayed monthly on the utility bill until the customer indicates otherwise and that the moneys collected shall be most economically and equitably disbursed through a system in which the contributions collected by electric utilities and gas utilities are transmitted to energy outreach Colorado.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When an individual with a disability is accompanied by a service animal or an animal that is being trained as a service animal, as defined in section 24-34-301, C.R.S., for such individual with a disability, neither the individual with a disability nor the service animal shall be denied the facilities of any common carrier, nor shall the individual with a disability be denied the immediate custody of the service animal while riding upon a common carrier. The provisions of this section also apply to a trainer of a service animal, as defined in section 24-34-301, C.R.S., for use by a qualified individual with a disability, unless the service animal presents an imminent danger to the public health or safety. The individual with a disability or the trainer of the service animal shall be liable for any damage done to the premises or facilities of the common carrier by the service animal. An animal being individually trained for the purpose of aiding an individual with a disability shall be visibly and prominently identified as a service animal in training.

      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that cooperative electric associations which are owned by the member-consumers they serve are regulated by the member-consumers themselves acting through an elected governing body. It is further declared that the regulation by the public utilities commission under the “Public Utilities Law”, articles 1 to 7 of this title, may be duplicative of the self-regulation by the association and may be neither necessary nor cost-effective. It is therefore the purpose of this part 1 to determine the necessity of regulation by the public utilities commission by allowing cooperative electric associations to exempt themselves from regulation by the public utilities commission.

       After giving simultaneous notice by certified mail to other electric public utilities serving areas adjacent to an unserved, uncertificated territory and to the public utilities commission of its intent to extend service, a cooperative electric association shall have the right to extend service into such unserved, uncertificated territory unless the public utilities commission receives a complaint concerning such extension. Such complaint must be received by the commission no later than thirty days following the commission’s receipt of the notice of extension. Upon the filing of a complaint, the commission shall determine whether to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing such extension.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the provisions of article XXV of the Colorado constitution allow the public utilities commission to establish exclusive service territories for utilities as provided in article 5 of this title and that it has been the policy of the state of Colorado to establish exclusive service territories for cooperative electric associations. The general assembly further finds and declares that, if a cooperative electric association has been granted an exclusive service territory that is within a municipality that operates an electric utility or within an area annexed by a municipality that operates an electric utility, the municipality has taken private property and shall pay just compensation for the electric distribution facilities and certificate of public convenience and necessity of the association located within the municipality. Therefore, it is declared to be a matter of statewide concern and to be the purpose of this part 2 to establish a procedure to be followed when the certificated service territory of a cooperative electric association is included within a municipality that operates an electric utility or within an area annexed by a municipality that operates an electric utility.

       since such sections do not mandate that a public utility transfer all its customers and facilities to a municipality upon a notice of annexation by the municipality. Thus, there may not be a taking under the statutory scheme which would otherwise preclude regulation by the P.U.C. in such areas. This section, which provides for situations where the municipality can compete with the public utility, does not conflict with section 35 of article V of the state constitution.

        Legislative intent in establishing several types of motor vehicle transportation.
       </b>
       The general assembly established several types of motor vehicle transportation, including common and contract carriage. By doing so, without question it intended to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare by providing a framework for the better transportation of persons and property. Denver Cleanup Serv. Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).
      </p>

        This statute was enacted for the purpose of regulating any detrimental effect that contract carriers might have upon common carrier operation.

        Contract carriers remain outside scope of regulation.
       </b>
       This article was enacted for the regulation of motor vehicle carriers, but the act does not encompass private carriers. Private carriers remain outside the scope of regulation. Burbridge v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 91 Colo. 134, 12 P.2d 1115 (1932); Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Stanton Transp. Co., 153 Colo. 372, 386 P.2d 590 (1963).

      </p>
      <p>
       One may look in vain in the statutes or in the rulings of the commission and of the supreme court for a clear definition of contract carriage or for an articulation of specific guidelines to be followed in the issuance of a contract carrier permit. Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).

      <p>
       <b>
        The fundamental distinction between a common and contract carrier
       </b>
       is that the contract carrier enters into a contract with each of his customers and assumes no obligation to carry for any other, while the common carrier undertakes to carry for all persons indifferently. Ward Transp. Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 151 Colo. 76, 376 P.2d 166 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal statutory distinction between the two is that a contract carrier is one which is not a common carrier. Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the fundamental distinctions between a contract carrier and a common carrier is that a contract carrier has an obligation only to his contract-customers and has no obligation to others desiring carriage. In contrast, the common carrier must convey for all desiring its transportation. Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A motor vehicle carrier cannot at the same time be both a contract carrier and a common carrier
       </b>
       by utilizing one part of a truck for common-carrier service and another part of the same truck for contract-carrier service. Such a holding would make regulatory power ridiculous. McKay v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 104 Colo. 402, 91 P.2d 965 (1939).

        Situation in which carrier is neither common nor private or contract.
       </b>
       A milk company that transports all the milk it produces to its processing plant, f.o.b. at the producers’ stations is neither a common carrier nor a private or contract carrier for hire, because it then hauls only its own property. Colo. Milk Transp., Inc. v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 269 F.2d 755 (10th Cir. 1959).

        Indiscriminately accepting freight is undoubtedly one of the important tests
       </b>
       in ascertaining whether or not a certain operation has the elements of a common carrier. Greeley Transp. Co. v. People, 79 Colo. 307, 245 P. 720 (1926); Burbridge v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 91 Colo. 134, 12 P.2d 1115 (1932); Bushnell v. People, 92 Colo. 174, 19 P.2d 197 (1933); McDill v. North E. Motor Freight, Inc., 92 Colo. 198, 19 P.2d 204 (1933); McKay v. Pub. Utils.

        Carrier who does not accept freight for hire indiscriminately is not a common carrier.
       </b>
       A motor vehicle operator engaged in the transportation of freight for hire under contracts with various individuals is not a common carrier because he does not hold himself out as willing to, and does not in fact, accept freight for transportation for hire indiscriminately for all who might or did seek such service. Ward Transp., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 151 Colo. 76, 376 P.2d 166 (1962).

       <b>
        Authority as to contract carriers is solely statutory.
       </b>
       The commission’s authority over common carriers stems from both the constitution and the statutes, while its authority with respect to contract motor carriers is solely statutory. Miller Bros. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 185 Colo. 414, 525 P.2d 443 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There is agreement as to certain characteristics.
       </b>
       While the definition of contract carriage has never been clarified by legislation or the commission, there is general agreement as to certain contract carriage characteristics: (1) A contract carrier cannot serve the general public; (2) a contract carrier cannot participate in the formal rate-making process of the commission; and (3) a contract carrier cannot interline. Also, a contract carrier may not advertise in any newspaper, magazine, or other publication or otherwise hold itself out to serve the public indiscriminately. Miller Bros. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 185 Colo. 414, 525 P.2d 443 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Contract” means in the interest of the individual,
       </b>
       as distinguished from enterprise or business operated by or on behalf of the public, or of any official function performed for public benefit. Colo. Contractors Ass’n v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 128 Colo. 333, 262 P.2d 266 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Contract carriage not declared public utility.
       </b>
       The general assembly has declared that a “common carrier” is a “public utility”. However, contract carriage has not been so declared. Miller Bros. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 185 Colo. 414, 525 P.2d 443 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A contract carrier provides service at its convenience
       </b>
       and subject to the negotiation of a satisfactory agreement between the private carrier and its customer. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. DeLue, 175 Colo. 317, 486 P.2d 1050 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example of contract carrier.
       </b>
       A motor vehicle operator engaged in the transportation of freight for hire under contracts with various individuals is not a common carrier because he does not hold himself out as willing to, and does not in fact, accept freight for transportation for hire indiscriminately for all who might or did seek such service. Ward Transp., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 151 Colo. 76, 376 P.2d 166 (1962).

        Test used in determining whether applicant is contract carrier held invalid.
       </b>
       Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       A guideline of the public utilities commission (PUC) requiring that, to be considered a contract carrier, the proposed service must be beyond the capabilities of an authorized common carrier in effect grants a monopoly to common carriers, eliminating the need for contract carriage except under too limited circumstances. Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guidelines used by the commission in determining whether an applicant is to be considered a contract carrier promote too strongly the demise of contract carriers, and since the legislative purpose negates a result that either class be obliterated by the commission’s fiat, it follows that the commission’s test violates legislative intent and purpose. Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).

        The constitution and the statutes of this state have given to the business of trash hauling the status of a matter of statewide concern,
       </b>
       subject to the jurisdiction of the PUC. Under such circumstances, a city has no power to pass an ordinance that is in conflict with the exercise by the commission of its statutory power. Givigliano v. Veltri, 180 Colo. 10, 501 P.2d 1044 (1972).

        Right of property exists in refuse material until it is destroyed.
       </b>
       Although the owner of refuse materials may regard them as of no value, still the right to their possession and the need for their disposal are within the control of the individual owner. All of these materials have certain valuable uses under varied circumstances, and even though the owner desires to dispose of or destroy such materials, the right of property continues until disposed of or destroyed. In performing such disposal service, appellant was clearly engaged in the business of a common carrier. Schlagel v. Hoelsken, 162 Colo. 142, 425 P.2d 39, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 827, 88 S.

       The amendment of § 40-10-101 expressly to include in the definition of “motor vehicle carrier”, as follows: “any motor vehicle used in serving the public in the business of transportation of ashes, trash, waste, rubbish, and garbage”, did not change the law; it merely clarified it.

         The public utilities commission (PUC) has broad constitutional and statutory authority.
        </b>
        However, the breadth of that authority is to be tested by the statutes themselves and not by the unbridled whim of the commission. The commission is a creature of statute. Both the power and scope of its authority and its procedures are necessarily controlled by the act upon which it relies. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Colo. Motorway, Inc., 165 Colo. 1, 437 P.2d 44 (1968).

         Commission must comply with “procedural due process”.
        </b>
        The PUC, in a general investigation held for the purpose of promulgating rules and regulations, cannot, regardless of the type of evidence that may be presented to it, revoke, amend, or alter permits or certificates of participating parties. It must comply with the statutory procedural requirements which would legally justify the end sought to be accomplished, issue a notice, hold a hearing at which the respondent is given an opportunity to defend itself, and finally, enter its decision in accordance with the evidence. Anything less will not satisfy the statute nor that quality of fairness required by “procedural due process”. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Colo. Motorway, Inc., 165 Colo. 1, 437 P.2d 44 (1968).

         Request for records authorized by rule under this section was not an unconstitutional warrantless search.

        When § 40-11-103 and this section are read together, and in light of the general public policy of the law to protect common carriers, it is apparent that denial of an application for transfer of a permit is within the PUC’s regulatory authority. Mobile Pre-Mix Transit, Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 618 P.2d 663 (Colo. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The PUC may properly deny a transfer of a contract carrier’s permit wherever there is a substantial opportunity for a transferee, because of its advantageous position in the industry, to discriminate or compete unfairly.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Commission’s duty to adopt rates.
        </b>
        It is of particular significance that the general assembly in this section not only granted power and authority but also made it the commission’s duty to adopt rates. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).

       <p>
        <b>
         Section not applicable unless contract carrier competing with common carrier in rendering substantially same service.
        </b>
        If a contract carrier is not competing with a common carrier and if the former is not rendering a service substantially the same or similar to that of the common carrier, then the terms and provisions of subsection (2) do not come into play and the tariff filed with the PUC is lawful, even though calling for rates less than those of the common carrier. Denver-Climax Truck Line v. Jim Chelf, Inc., 167 Colo. 69, 445 P.2d 399 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rules by commission which establish the manner in which the minimum rate for a contract carrier competing with a common carrier is to be determined, which require a contract carrier competing with any scheduled common carrier to file a tariff of rates and charges not less than the lowest rate prescribed for any competing common carrier providing substantially the same or similar service, and which authorize the commission to change any tariff or rate of any contract carrier competing with a motor vehicle common carrier providing substantially the same or similar service, are consistent with the doctrine of regulated competition and are in accord with the commission’s statutory authority to prescribe minimum rates for contract carriers not less than the rates prescribed for common carriers providing substantially the same or similar service. Regular Rt. Com. Carrier Conf. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 761 P.2d 737 (1988).

         Rates to protect public and prevent destructive rate-making.
        </b>
        The commission has been charged with the duty to carry out its mission in two areas, to wit: To protect the public and to prevent destructive rate-making which could result in nonavailability of the service to the public. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).

        <b>
         Duty to prescribe rates for contract carriers tied to same duty for common carriers.
        </b>
        Reading this section it would be impossible for the commission to carry out a duty to prescribe minimum rates for contract carriers if it established no rates for common carriers. The one duty is tied in with the other, and the prescribed rates for one class are the basis for the minimum rates for the other. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Fairness of rate left to commission.
        </b>
        The general assembly itself has declared the necessity and the duty and left to the commission the determination of a rate that is fair to the public and sufficiently compensatory to the utility to ensure a fair return on its investment. Regulation--not nonregulation--has been declared to be in the public interest. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).

         Mandamus is proper only where there is a legal duty to perform the act requested.
        </b>
        Where the PUC has no clear legal duty to reject or annul the rates published, then until the PUC has determined that contract and common carriers are competing and that the services are substantially similar to those rendered by a competing common carrier, it has no duty to reject those rates, and no right to relief in the nature of mandamus in the trial court will lie.

The complainant may request any relief that the commission, in its authority, may grant, including an order to cease and desist, suspension or revocation of the motor carrier’s certificate or permit, or assessment of civil penalties. Upon proof of violation, the commission may issue an order to cease and desist, suspend or revoke the motor carrier’s certificate or permit, assess civil penalties as provided in article 7 of this title, or take any other action within the commission’s authority.

In the case of an entity, the two-year period of ineligibility also applies to all principals, officers, and directors of the entity, whether or not any such principal, officer, or director applies individually or as a principal, officer, or director of the same or a different entity.

        Annotator’s note.
       </b>
       Since § 40-10.1-112 is similar to §§ 40-10-112, 40-11-110, and 40-13-103 as they existed prior to the 2011 reorganization of the motor carrier statutes, relevant cases construing those sections have been included in the annotations to this section.

       <b>
        This section empowers the public utilities commission (PUC) to order a revocation or to alter or to amend a certificate
       </b>
       of public convenience and necessity for a violation of its rules and regulations. Colo. Transf. &amp; Storage, Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 180 Colo. 327, 505 P.2d 370 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Procedural due process requires that in addition to a fair and open hearing,
       </b>
       there must be due notice and an opportunity to be heard, and the procedure must be consistent with the essentials of a fair trial, and the agency must act upon evidence and not arbitrarily. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Colo. Motorway, Inc., 165 Colo. 1, 437 P.2d 44 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Facts determine what is proper notice.
       </b>
       The question of what is proper notice, or, as here, of what constitutes a specific designation of the issue raised or charges made, depends necessarily upon the facts of each case, the type of investigation being conducted, the violation alleged, and the penalty or order sought to be imposed. Where the purpose of the investigation by the PUC is only to determine the reasonableness of rates charged by a utility, a different standard would seem to apply than where the franchise of the utility is sought to be revoked for violation of the utility laws and a penalty or fine imposed. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Colo. Motorway, Inc., 165 Colo. 1, 437 P.2d 44 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Authority to revoke permit.
       </b>
       If the evidence supports a finding that the statutes governing the regulation of the particular carrier and the rules and regulations of the commission have in fact been violated, it is clear that the commission has the statutory authority to revoke the violator’s PUC permit. Rumney v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 172 Colo. 314, 472 P.2d 149 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section requires before revocation, alteration, or amendment of a private permit, a hearing
       </b>
       after notice of alleged violations of law, rules, and regulations or the terms of the permit. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Colo. Motorway, Inc., 165 Colo. 1, 437 P.2d 44 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission cannot revoke a contract carrier permit without compliance with the notice and hearing provisions of this section. Red Ball Motor Freight, Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 185 Colo. 438, 525 P.2d 439 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the commission did not give notice or hold a hearing, it had no authority to revoke a contract carrier’s certificate. Miller Bros. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 185 Colo. 414, 525 P.2d 443 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       A hearing must be held before the commission can take administrative action regarding alteration of previously granted permits to provide contract carrier service. J.C. Trucking v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 776 P.2d 366 (Colo. 1989).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Right of review upon cancellation of certificate.
       </b>
       The penalty ordered by the commission was that the carrier’s certificate and permit be cancelled unless he elected to accept certain restrictions. The carrier had the right to have the propriety of the commission’s decision, which includes findings and conclusions, as well as an order, reviewed by the courts and was not required to make an election until he has obtained such judicial review. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Tucker, 167 Colo. 130, 445 P.2d 901 (1968).

        No property right to be on tow list.

       and to resort to the courts to see to it that laws, rules, regulations, orders, and decisions dealing with public utilities are obeyed, enforced, and made effective. The PUC can do this on its own volition and no doubt could and would do so at the request of an aggrieved party. Don Ward, Inc. v. Miller, 154 Colo. 370, 390 P.2d 812 (1964).

       The general assembly did not by these sections contemplate that every alleged violation of the terms of a certificate of public convenience and necessity had to be heard in a court of record. The commission has inherent power to investigate alleged violations and to make its orders, subject to review as provided by law. Enforcement of its orders may become a matter for judicial determination in which event this section applies. Eveready Freight Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils.

       Where a certificated carrier filed an action in the district court seeking to enjoin another certificated carrier from transporting freight beyond the scope of the authority granted and to the injury of the plaintiff, the supreme court held that the trial court has power to enjoin the defendant from operating in violation of the terms of his permit and to punish him for contempt for violation of its order.

        The fundamental distinction between a common and contract carrier
       </b>
       is that the contract carrier enters into a contract with each of his customers and assumes no obligation to carry for any other, while the common carrier undertakes to carry for all persons indifferently. Ward Transp. Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 151 Colo. 76, 376 P.2d 166 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal statutory distinction between the two is that a contract carrier is one which is not a common carrier. Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the fundamental distinctions between a contract carrier and a common carrier is that a contract carrier has an obligation only to his contract-customers and has no obligation to others desiring carriage. In contrast, the common carrier must convey for all desiring its transportation. Denver Cleanup Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 192 Colo. 537, 561 P.2d 1252 (1977).

       The PUC does not offer, directly or indirectly, telephone services, electric services, motor vehicle services, or any other public utility services or programs to the public. Its function is limited to regulation of private entities and public utilities that offer such services. Reeves v. Queen City Transp., 10 F. Supp. 2d 1181 (D. Colo. 1998).

        Regulated competition to protect public from destructive or excessive competition.
       </b>
       The obligation to safeguard the general public against the impaired services or higher rates accompanying destructive or excessive competition is at the heart of the policy of regulated competition. Morey v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 629 P.2d 1061 (Colo. 1981); Trans-Western Express, Ltd. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 877 P.2d 350 (Colo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The policy of regulated competition endorsed by subsection (2) reflects a legislative determination that some restraints on inter-carrier competition are necessary to protect the public interest. Morey v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 629 P.2d 1061 (Colo. 1981).

        Effect of finding of unlawfulness under old doctrine.
       </b>
       Under the regulated monopoly doctrine in effect prior to this section, it has intimated fairly strongly that when a contract carrier was violating the law and operating as a common carrier he could not use this as the basis for obtaining a common carrier certificate. Again, with some shadings, if there was a finding of unlawfulness of the contract carrier permit, the certificate of public convenience and necessity would be denied, irrespective of the character of the unlawfulness. Thacker Bros. Transp. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 189 Colo. 301, 543 P.2d 719 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Present effect.
       </b>
       For a certificate to be denied under the present section there must be a finding by the commission, not only of unlawfulness, but of violations of the law including the rules and regulations of the commission reaching the height of intentional violation, reckless disregard for the law, or persistent, protracted, intentional, and knowing violation.

        Question involves whether convenience and necessity demand additional service.
       </b>
       The question involved in the granting or denial of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a common carrier in a particular area is not whether the extent of business in such area is sufficient to warrant an additional certified carrier, but whether the public convenience and necessity demand an additional service.

       To enable the provision of common carrier or contract carrier service for which there appears to be an immediate and urgent need to any point or within a territory having no such service capable of meeting the need, the commission may, in its discretion and without hearings or other proceedings, grant temporary authority for such service by a common carrier or a contract carrier, as the case may be. Such temporary authority, unless suspended or revoked for good cause, is valid for such time as the commission specifies, but for not more than an aggregate of one hundred eighty days, unless for good cause shown the commission extends the temporary authority for a period which may extend until a final administrative decision is rendered. A grant of temporary authority or an extension thereof creates no presumption that corresponding permanent authority will be granted thereafter.

       Pending the determination of an application filed with the commission for approval of an acquisition of stock of a common carrier or contract carrier, a consolidation or merger of two or more such carriers, or a purchase, lease, or contract to operate the properties of one or more such carriers, the commission may, in its discretion and without hearings or other proceedings, grant temporary approval for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty days for the operation of the carrier or its properties sought to be acquired by the person proposing in such pending application to acquire the properties or stock, if it appears that failure to grant such temporary approval may result in destruction of or injury to the carrier or its properties sought to be acquired, or may interfere substantially with their future usefulness in the performance of adequate and continuous service to the public. For good cause shown, the commission may extend such temporary approval for a period which may extend until a final administrative decision is rendered. Temporary approval or an extension thereof does not create a presumption that the application will be granted.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a10.1p02s40-10.1-204ol13">
       Common carrier or contract carrier service rendered under temporary authority or approval is subject to all applicable provisions of this title and to the rules and requirements of the commission. The maximum time period of any temporary authority or approval is not subject to extension or renewal.

      <li id="t40a10.1p02s40-10.1-204ol14">
       The commission shall not issue a temporary authority or approval unless, under such general rules as the commission may prescribe governing the application and notice thereof to interested or affected common carriers, all interested or affected carriers have been given at least five days’ notice of the filing of the application and an opportunity to protest the granting thereof. If the commission determines that an emergency exists, it may issue temporary authority or approval at once by making specific reference in its order to the circumstances constituting the emergency, in which case no notice need be given, but any such emergency authority or approval expires no later than thirty days after it was issued.

It must comply with the statutory procedural requirements which would legally justify the end sought to be accomplished, issue a notice, hold a hearing at which the respondent is given an opportunity to defend itself, and finally, enter its decision in accordance with the evidence. Anything less will not satisfy the statute nor that quality of fairness required by “procedural due process”. Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Colo. Motorway, Inc., 165 Colo. 1, 437 P.2d 44 (1968).

         Commission authorized to deny application for transfer of permit.
        </b>
        When § 40-11-103 and this section are read together, and in light of the general public policy of the law to protect common carriers, it is apparent that denial of an application for transfer of a permit is within the PUC’s regulatory authority. Mobile Pre-Mix Transit, Inc. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 618 P.2d 663 (Colo. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The PUC may properly deny a transfer of a contract carrier’s permit wherever there is a substantial opportunity for a transferee, because of its advantageous position in the industry, to discriminate or compete unfairly.

         Commission’s duty to adopt rates.
        </b>
        It is of particular significance that the general assembly in this section not only granted power and authority but also made it the commission’s duty to adopt rates. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).

         Section not applicable unless contract carrier competing with common carrier in rendering substantially same service.
        </b>
        If a contract carrier is not competing with a common carrier and if the former is not rendering a service substantially the same or similar to that of the common carrier, then the terms and provisions of subsection (2) do not come into play and the tariff filed with the PUC is lawful, even though calling for rates less than those of the common carrier. Denver-Climax Truck Line v. Jim Chelf, Inc., 167 Colo. 69, 445 P.2d 399 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rules by commission which establish the manner in which the minimum rate for a contract carrier competing with a common carrier is to be determined, which require a contract carrier competing with any scheduled common carrier to file a tariff of rates and charges not less than the lowest rate prescribed for any competing common carrier providing substantially the same or similar service, and which authorize the commission to change any tariff or rate of any contract carrier competing with a motor vehicle common carrier providing substantially the same or similar service, are consistent with the doctrine of regulated competition and are in accord with the commission’s statutory authority to prescribe minimum rates for contract carriers not less than the rates prescribed for common carriers providing substantially the same or similar service. Regular Rt. Com. Carrier Conf. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 761 P.2d 737 (1988).

         Rates to protect public and prevent destructive rate-making.
        </b>
        The commission has been charged with the duty to carry out its mission in two areas, to wit: To protect the public and to prevent destructive rate-making which could result in nonavailability of the service to the public. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).
       </p>

        <b>
         Duty to prescribe rates for contract carriers tied to same duty for common carriers.
        </b>
        Reading this section it would be impossible for the commission to carry out a duty to prescribe minimum rates for contract carriers if it established no rates for common carriers. The one duty is tied in with the other, and the prescribed rates for one class are the basis for the minimum rates for the other. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Fairness of rate left to commission.
        </b>
        The general assembly itself has declared the necessity and the duty and left to the commission the determination of a rate that is fair to the public and sufficiently compensatory to the utility to ensure a fair return on its investment. Regulation--not nonregulation--has been declared to be in the public interest. Consolidated Freightways Corps. v. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 158 Colo. 239, 406 P.2d 83 (1965).

         Mandamus is proper only where there is a legal duty to perform the act requested.
        </b>
        Where the PUC has no clear legal duty to reject or annul the rates published, then until the PUC has determined that contract and common carriers are competing and that the services are substantially similar to those rendered by a competing common carrier, it has no duty to reject those rates, and no right to relief in the nature of mandamus in the trial court will lie.

       <p>
        Intrastate movers in Colorado are regulated by the Colorado public utilities commission (PUC). Each mover should have a PUC permit number. You are encouraged to contact the PUC to confirm that the mover you are using is indeed permitted in Colorado.
        A mover that is not permitted may
        <b>
         <i>
          not
         </i>
        </b>
        withhold any of your property to enforce payment of money due under the contract (“carrier’s lien”).
        A mover must include its PUC permit number, true name, and physical (street) address in all advertisements.
        You should be aware that the total price of any household move can change, based on a number of factors that may include at least the following:• Additional services you request at the time of the move;• Additional items to be moved that were not included in the mover’s original estimate;• Changes to the location or accessibility of building entrances, at either end of the move, that were not included in the mover’s original estimate; and• Changes to the previously agreed date of pickup or delivery.
        You should also be aware that, in case of a dispute between you and the mover, Colorado has an arbitration process available to resolve the dispute without going to court.
        If you have any questions, you are encouraged to call the PUC for guidance on your rights and obligations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge that I have been given a copy of this consumer advisement to keep for my records.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that it is the policy of the state of Colorado to promote a competitive telecommunications marketplace while protecting and maintaining the wide availability of high-quality telecommunications services. Such goals are best achieved by legislation that brings telecommunications regulation into the modern era by guaranteeing the affordability of basic telephone service while fostering free market competition within the telecommunications industry. The general assembly further finds that the technological advancements and increased customer choices for telecommunications services generated by such market competition will enhance Colorado’s economic development and play a critical role in Colorado’s economic future. However, the general assembly recognizes that the strength of competitive force varies widely between markets and products and services. Therefore, to foster, encourage, and accelerate the continuing emergence of a competitive telecommunications environment, the general assembly declares that flexible regulatory treatments are appropriate for different telecommunications services.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission, with due consideration of the public interest, quality of service, financial condition, and just and reasonable rates, shall grant regulatory treatment that is less comprehensive than otherwise provided for under this article to rural telecommunications providers as defined in section 40-15-102 (24.5). The commission shall issue policy statements and rules and regulations that maintain reasonable regulatory oversight and that consider the cost of regulation in relation to the benefit derived from such regulation. These rules and regulations shall encourage the cost effective deployment and use of modern telecommunications technology. All proposed rules applicable to rural telecommunications providers that come before the commission shall consider the economic impact on rural telecommunications providers and their subscribers. The commission and rural telecommunications providers are encouraged to work together in a cooperative and proactive fashion to implement this section.

       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that competition in the market for basic local exchange service will increase the choices available to customers and reduce the costs of such service. Accordingly, it is the policy of the state of Colorado to encourage competition in this market and strive to ensure that all consumers benefit from such increased competition. The commission is encouraged, where competition is not immediately possible, to utilize other interim marketplace mechanisms wherever possible, with the ultimate goal of replacing the regulatory framework established in part 2 of this article with a fully competitive telecommunications marketplace statewide as contemplated in this part 5.

       The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that many of Colorado’s residents are unable to utilize telecommunications facilities without assistance and are therefore telephone users with disabilities. Telephone users with disabilities include people who are deaf, hard of hearing, speech-impaired, deaf-blind, blind and visually impaired, and those with central nervous system disabilities. Telephone users with disabilities constitute a substantial and valuable resource within the United States and the state of Colorado, and this segment of our population needs access to telecommunications facilities in order to be contributing and productive members of our society. The role of telecommunications in our world today is inestimable. Telecommunications is the primary vehicle of commerce and industry, the means to convey and receive information and knowledge, and is one of the ways we communicate with others on a personal as well as business level. Telecommunications results in greater independence and self-sufficiency by expanding the channels for employment opportunities, the market for goods and services, human contact, and fellowship. Telephone users with disabilities should have equal access to this critical tool, not only for their own sake, but for the benefit of society at large. The ability to use telecommunications will enhance the business and personal lives of telephone users with disabilities while stimulating and promoting economic development in Colorado. The general assembly recognizes the vitality and potential of Colorado’s individuals with disabilities, including telephone users with disabilities. Telecommunications is vital to our society, and supporting its availability to telephone users with disabilities is a beneficial investment for all of Colorado.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a17s40-17-101ol12">
       The general assembly therefore concludes that it is appropriate to provide access to telecommunications for telephone users with disabilities by establishing telecommunications relay services that replace and expand the dual party relay system required pursuant to this article as the article existed prior to July 1, 1992.

The commission shall not file a notice of lien, issue a distraint warrant, institute a suit for collection, or take other action to collect the amount after the expiration of such period unless the commission issues a notice of assessment for the amount within such period or within an extended period pursuant to subsection (5)(d) of this section.

        Railroad has right to locate its own stations.
       </b>
       No statute requires that connected roads shall adopt joint stations, or that one railroad company shall stop at or make use of the station of another. Each company in the state has the legal right to locate its own stations, and, so far as statutory regulations are concerned, is not required to use any other. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. R. v. Denver &amp; N. O. R. R., 110 U.S. 667, 4 S. Ct. 185, 28 L. Ed. 291 (1884).

      It is lawful for any railroad company or corporation, organized or existing under the laws of this state, and whose line or road is made or is in the process of construction to the boundary line of the state or to any point either in or out of the state, under authority of its laws, to merge and consolidate its capital stock, franchises, and property into and with the capital stock, franchises, and property of any other railroad company or corporation organized and existing under the laws of any adjoining state whenever the two or more railroads of the companies or corporations so to be consolidated form a continuous line of railroad with each other or by means of any intervening railroad; and roads running to the bank of a river which is not bridged shall be held to be continuous. Nothing in this article shall be taken to authorize the consolidation of any company or corporation of this state with that of any other state, unless the laws of such other state authorize such consolidation; but parallel or competing lines of railroad shall not be consolidated.

        This section reenacts, in effect, § 11 of art. XV, Colo. Const.,
       </b>
       and further declares, substantially, that the consent upon the part of a city to the construction of a street railroad therein shall not operate to relieve or protect those constructing the road, etc., “against any claim for damages to private property, which otherwise, without such consent, might be lawfully maintained against” the persons constructing the road. Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Insufficient complaint under this section.
       </b>
       A complaint under this section states no cause of action where it contains no allegation that the railway track is above or below the surface of the street, or was in anywise improperly or negligently constructed, or that the road, as a structure, in any way hampers ingress or egress. Where the inconvenience alleged arises from “the frequency with which cars are operated upon said tracks”, and in no sense from the structure itself, the defendant is not liable for inconvenience of either character, because they are merely incident to the use of the highway for public travel. Denver &amp; S. F. Ry. v. Hannegan, 43 Colo. 122, 95 P. 343, 127 Am. St. R. 100, 16 L.R.A. (n.s.) 874 (1908); Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Railroad’s liability for damage or taking of private property is the same as that of city.
       </b>
       This section makes it certain, as between municipalities and those constructing street railroads therein, that the latter shall make compensation for private property taken or damaged in the construction of such public works. In other words, as to the liability for compensation for private property taken or damaged, those constructing the road stand in the place of the city. Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Under this section plaintiff’s rights depend solely upon whether the property has been taken or damaged.
       </b>
       Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        It must appear that plaintiff had some right in, use of, or interest pertaining to the property
       </b>
       which has been wholly or partially destroyed before she can maintain a cause of action for damages to her property. Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The right disturbed may be either public or private, but it must be a right which is enjoyed in connection with one’s property,
       </b>
       and which gave to it an additional value, and without which, or as affected by the disturbance, the property itself is damaged. The disturbance of the right of easement may be at a distance from the property injured, but the interference must be with some right held with regard to that property. Gilbert v. Greeley, S. L. &amp; Pac. Ry., 13 Colo. 501, 22 P. 814 (1889); Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The injury sustained must be damages to one’s property, not incidental injuries
       </b>
       arising from a careful exercise of legal rights by defendant in a manner that does not invade the legal rights of plaintiff. City of Denver v. Bayer, 7 Colo. 113, 2 P. 6 (1883); Denver Circle R. R. v. Nestor, 10 Colo. 403, 15 P. 714 (1887); Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The use of the streets in municipalities for street railway is one of the ordinary and usual purposes
       </b>
       for which such streets and highways may be used. Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The use of the streets in municipalities for street railway does not entitle the adjoining owner to compensation.
       </b>
       Such a street railway, so laid and operated as not to materially impair access to, or the enjoyment of, the adjacent property may lawfully be placed in the public highways of the city, if expressly sanctioned by proper authority. Such a use does not impose any additional burden entitling the owner of adjoining land to compensation; nor can it be justly regarded, at the present day, as any substantial impairment of the public easement or of the private rights of proprietors of land abutting on the street. Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Noises and vibrations of cars give no cause of action.
       </b>
       The annoyances, discomfort, and injury, suffered by the abutter from the ringing of bells, and loud and discordant noises produced by the cars in passing over the tracks and around curves, are, excepting as to degree, suffered by the public generally so far as such noises and vibrations are heard and felt, and give no action. Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The abutter is entitled to receive at, or remove from his premises, persons or goods,
       </b>
       and to have vehicles stand in front thereof upon the street, for the time reasonably necessary for this purpose, even though this may temporarily interfere with the passage of others; and if this right is interfered with he may have redress therefor in a proper action. Harrison v. Denver City Tramway Co., 54 Colo. 593, 131 P. 409 (1913).

      Any person, company, corporation, or association desiring in good faith to construct, maintain, and operate an electric railroad over, along, or across any county road within any county in this state may petition the board of county commissioners of such county for a franchise and right-of-way for the construction, maintenance, and operation of an electric railroad. The board of county commissioners, in accordance with the conditions provided in this section, may grant said right-of-way and franchise for a period not exceeding twenty years.

        The fact that a railroad might have been built some years earlier does not fulfill the requirement that it be shown that this particular railroad company, which is the defendant, either had a road “open to use” at the time the act became a law or that it succeeded to some company having such road so open to use.

         Presumed that animals come upon the track at the point where they are killed.

         Absolute liability until evidence rebutted.
        </b>
        The evidence disclosed that the road was unfenced and there was no enclosure where the animals were killed. This established proof of absolute liability, until the company showed that the road was enclosed as required by law or that the killing was at a point where no enclosure was required.

       The fact that plaintiff, suing for the value of an animal killed at a railroad crossing, in making his case does not alone rely on this section creating a presumption of negligence from the killing, but also introduced evidence of the negligence of the engineer and fireman, does not change the rule of burden of proof.

It is the duty of the defendant to introduce any evidence it has, showing why plaintiff should not recover on the prima facie case made. If it fails to offer any testimony to the effect, the objection that no negligence was shown, is without merit. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. v. Wheatley, 64 Colo. 598, 173 P. 396 (1918).

       Engineer to notify agent - inspection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t40a27s40-27-106ol11">
       Whenever any cattle, sheep, horses, mules, or asses are killed or injured by any train, engine, or car upon any railway in this state, it is the duty of the engineer operating the engine, train, or car to notify the station agent at the first station at which the train stops after the killing or wounding or the superintendent or other proper official at the end of the division where the engineer’s run ends. Should none of the employees of the train be aware of such killing or wounding, then it is the duty of any employee of the railway who becomes aware of such accident to notify the station agent at the nearest station to the point where the accident occurred.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a27s40-27-106ol12">
       It is the duty of the railroad company, through its station agent or such other official as may be designated, upon receipt of the information of the killing or wounding of any such livestock by any engine, train, or car, as soon as may be, to notify the section foreman upon whose section the accident occurred and also the nearest inspector of the state board of stock inspection commissioners.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a27s40-27-106ol13">
       It is the duty of the section foreman upon receiving the information to go to the point where the animal was killed or injured as soon as may be and there inspect the same, securing a full description of the animal together with any brands or marks that are upon the same and such other details as may serve to determine the ownership of such animal.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a27s40-27-106ol14">
       It is the duty of said stock inspector, as soon as may be after receiving said notice, to go to the point where the animal was killed or injured and there inspect the same, securing a full description of the animal together with any brands or marks that may be on the same and such other details as may serve to determine ownership of such animal. It is also the duty of the inspector to estimate as nearly as possible the probable value of said animal if killed or the amount of damages if injured.
      </li>
      <li id="t40a27s40-27-106ol15">
       Should the animal be so badly injured that it is in great suffering and cannot live or recover, it is the duty of either the stock inspector or the section foreman upon inspection to immediately kill the animal. If through any cause such an authorized inspector does not appear to inspect such animal so killed within thirty-six hours after such killing, it is the duty of the section foreman to remove the hide of said animal and preserve the same until it has been inspected by such inspector, and thereafter the carcass of such animal shall be disposed of by the railroad company, without prejudice to its rights, in such manner as it may determine.

      In case such railway company or corporation or the assignee or lessee thereof fails for thirty days after demand made therefor by the owner of any animal or his agent or attorney to pay such owner or his agent or attorney the value of said animal as claimed, then such owner, within six months from date of filing claim, may sue and recover the same from such railroad company or corporation or the assignee or lessee thereof in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which said animal was killed or injured, together with the legal interest thereon from the date such animal was killed or injured. Any person having a claim arising under the provisions of sections 40-27-102 to 40-27-113 may assign same in writing to any other claimant or person for value or for the purpose of suit, who shall thereupon have all the rights and remedies of the assignor; but, in case it becomes necessary on the part of any owner to establish claim for any animal so killed or injured in a court of competent jurisdiction, he shall have the right to establish the actual and market value of such animal or the actual damage so sustained.

     <p>
      Whenever any horse, cow, or other animal is injured by a train or otherwise on the right-of-way of any railroad company, it is the duty of trackwalkers, section men, brakemen, conductors, firefighters, engineers, and other employees of said company to care for such animal at once and report the facts to the nearest station agent and then notify the state board of stock inspection commissioners. It is the duty of the agent to give immediate notice, when possible, of the condition of such animal to the owner or the owner’s agent whose duty it is forthwith upon receipt of notice to have such animal properly cared for. When immediate notice to the owner is not possible, it is the duty of the station agent to have such injured animal properly cared for without delay.

      Every railroad corporation operating its lines of road or any part thereof within this state, between the fifteenth day of July and the first day of November of each and every year, upon each side of its line of road, shall plow as a fire guard a continuous strip of not less than six feet in width, which said strip of land shall run parallel with said line of railroad and be plowed in such a good and workmanlike manner as to effectually destroy and cover up the vegetation thereon and be sufficient to prevent the spread of fire. In addition thereto all such railroad corporations shall cause to be burned, between said dates, all the grass and vegetation lying between the said plowed strips and the track of said road, and the outer line of said strip of plowed land shall be upon the outer line of such corporation’s right-of-way or, if upon land owned by said corporation, one hundred feet on either side from the center of the road. Such fire guard to be so plowed need not be constructed within the limits of any town or city, nor along the line of a railroad running through the mountains, nor in other lands where plowing would be impracticable, but the provisions respecting the burning of a strip on each side shall be duly conformed with whenever any vegetation is found along such line of road. The boards of county commissioners of the various counties of the state shall prescribe for their respective counties where the plowing of such fire guard and burning shall be done.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every railroad company operating its line of road, or any part thereof, within this state shall be liable for all damages by fires that are set out or caused by operating any such line of road, or any part thereof, in this state, whether negligently or otherwise. Such damages may be recovered by the party damaged by a proper action in any court of competent jurisdiction; but said action shall be brought by the party injured within two years next ensuing after it accrues. The liability imposed in this section shall inure solely in favor of the owner or mortgagee of the property so damaged or destroyed by fire, and the same shall not pass by assignment or subrogation to any insurance company that has written a policy thereon.

         This section is intended to provide an indemnity to owners against loss from fire

It was enacted to settle upon whom the loss should fall, and because of the peculiar manner in which railway companies use this dangerous element, it casts the responsibility of employing it on them.

        This section, being general in its terms and applying to all cases within its scope, is not to be condemned as class legislation.

Such was obviously the meaning intended by the general assembly and this meaning avoids the necessity of declaring the act unconstitutional.

        This section imposes upon railroad companies absolute liability for all damages from fire set out in the operation of their roads, whether negligence entered into the cause or not, and the only question to be determined in cases of this character is, did the railway company set out or cause the fire in the operation of its road, if so, the answer is that the railroad is liable.

         Verdict based on incompetent evidence should be set aside.

         Evidence as to condition of engine is admissible.

        In an action against a railroad company to recover damages for property destroyed by fire, testimony as to the condition of an engine belonging to defendant and which was shown to have passed on the track close to the place where the fire originated a few minutes before its discovery, by a witness who examined the engine a week or two weeks after the fire, is admissible and its exclusion is error.

       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         The fact of the origin of the fire, like any other material fact, should be established.

        Denver, T. &amp; G. R. R. v. De Graff, 2 Colo. App. 42, 29 P. 664 (1892); Crissey &amp; Fowler Lumber Co. v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 17 Colo. App. 275, 68 P. 670 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The evidence required to establish the origin of a fire must be direct and connect
        </b>
        the fire with the operation of the railroad, or the circumstances must be such as to preclude all probability of the fire having originated in any other way. Stratton v. Union Pac. Ry., 7 Colo. App. 126, 42 P. 602 (1895). See Denver, T. &amp;. G. R. R. v. De Graff, 2 Colo. App. 42, 29 P. 664 (1892); Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. v. Morton, 3 Colo. App. 155, 32 P. 345 (1893).

       <p>
        <b>
         Considerable latitude is allowed in introducing testimony.
        </b>
        From the nature and circumstances of cases under this section considerable latitude must be allowed in the introduction of testimony, and in the drawing of inferences as to the origin of the fire. Union P. R. R. v. Jones, 9 Colo. 379, 12 P. 516 (1886); Union Pac. Ry. v. De Busk, 12 Colo. 294, 20 P. 752 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Juries should not be allowed to infer or presume origin of fire.
        </b>
        In cases of this kind, juries should not be allowed to infer or presume, for want of positive proof to the contrary, that the fire was communicated by the operating of the railroad. Denver, T. &amp; G. R. R. v. De Graff, 2 Colo. App. 42, 29 P. 664 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Juries may infer or presume origin of fire where the evidence was sufficient to warrant the inference
        </b>
        that the fire was caused by the defendant’s passing train because several witnesses testified in substance to the springing up of the fire immediately upon the passing of the train, and that there was no fire on the premises before, and no other apparent cause for the fire. Union Pac. Ry. v. De Busk, 12 Colo. 294, 20 P. 752 (1888); Cyle v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 37 Colo. 298, 86 P. 1010 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Sufficient evidence rebuts probability of fire originating in any other manner.
        </b>
        While the jury, within certain limits, may be left to infer the fact from the circumstances proved, such proof should be sufficient to rebut the probability of the fire having originated in any other manner. Denver, T. &amp; G. R. R. v. De Graff, 2 Colo. App. 42, 29 P. 664 (1892); Crissey &amp; Fowler Lumber Co. v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 17 Colo. App. 275, 68 P. 670 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The fact that a fire burned along the line of a railway is not evidence
        </b>
        that it was caused by the railroad company. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. v. Morton, 3 Colo. App. 155, 32 P. 345 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The fact that railroad aided in putting out fire is not evidence
        </b>
        that it was caused by the railroad company. Acts which follow an injury cannot be proven in civil actions for the purpose of establishing an antecedent negligence. That a railroad company aided in putting out a fire burning along its track does not tend to establish the fact that it caused the fire. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. v. Morton, 3 Colo. App. 155, 32 P. 345 (1893).

         V. RIGHTS OF INSURER.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         The insurer is not to be subrogated to rights of the insured.
        </b>
        Any contract to the contrary, or an assignment by the insured to the insurer, in the policy, of the former’s right of action, is without effect. Rhinehart v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 61 Colo. 369, 158 P. 149 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Railroad cannot escape liability because insurer is also liable.
        </b>
        The railroad company cannot escape its statutory liability because the owner has seen fit to contract and pay for indemnity against loss by fire from another source, and upon account of his close proximity to the railroad, probably having paid a higher rate than otherwise. In such cases all the authorities are to the effect that unless otherwise provided by statute the insurance feature is no defense to the railroad company. Rhinehart v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 61 Colo. 369, 158 P. 149 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The owner of the property damaged or destroyed recovers his loss in full,
        </b>
        though he has received the insurance money. Rhinehart v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 61 Colo. 369, 158 P. 149 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The question of double payment to the owner is a matter purely between the insured and the insurer.
        </b>
        The contracts of the appellants for the insurance of their property, with the insurance companies, and their subsequent conduct in relation thereto, are matters in which the wrong-doer had no concern, and which do not affect the measure of its liability. Rhinehart v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 61 Colo. 369, 158 P. 149 (1916).

         VI. LIMITATION OF ACTIONS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         The time fixed by this section is a condition of the right to sue at all,
        </b>
        and a complaint which fails to state that the action was brought within that time fails to state a cause of action and is subject to demurrer. Rhinehart v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R., 61 Colo. 369, 158 P. 149 (1916); Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. v. United States, 241 F. 614 (8th Cir. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Failure to bring action within two years acts as limitation of the liability itself.
        </b>
        The statute provides that suit must be brought within two years, and we think a failure to bring the suit within the time prescribed by the statute acts as a limitation of the liability itself, and in this respect differs from the ordinary statutes of limitation which affect the remedy only. Denver &amp; R. G. R. R. v. United States, 241 F. 614 (8th Cir. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Meaning of “accrues”.
        </b>
        The word “accrues” is employed in different ways. It was evidently the intent of the general assembly to use it in this section in its ordinary sense, which would mean any right that had arisen, that is, was in existence before the passage of the law. British Am. Assurance Co. v. Colo. &amp; S. Ry., 52 Colo. 589, 125 P. 508 (1912).

     <p>
      A financing order is a final order of the commission. Notwithstanding section 40-6-115 (5) specifying proper venue for petition filings, a party aggrieved by the issuance of a financing order may petition for suspension and review of the financing order only in the district court for the city and county of Denver. In the case of any petition for suspension and review, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the action as expeditiously as practicable and shall give the action precedence over other matters not accorded similar precedence by law.
