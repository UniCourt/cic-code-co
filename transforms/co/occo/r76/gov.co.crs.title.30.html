                        not be paid, and a proportionate loss would be suffered; but when mileage in either a civil or criminal case has been collected and deposited, it is the duty of the board of commissioners to allow the traveling expenses incurred
                        in the case, payable out of the mileage, if it amounts to so much, or if not, to the extent of the mileage deposited. Bransom v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 5 Colo. App. 231, 37 P. 957 (1894).

        The mileage fees, if earned by the officer, had to be collected by him

                        The general assembly recognizes that in the establishment of the state of Colorado the counties of the territory of Colorado were adopted as the counties of the new state and that there have been additional counties established by law and in accordance
                        with then current methods of surveying and describing county boundaries. The general assembly finds and declares that it is desirable to revise the descriptions of county boundaries to update and establish by law more precise definitions
                        of the boundaries of the several counties of this state as they are known to exist with the use of modern methods and equipment. It is not the intent of the general assembly to effect the transfer of land from one county to another
                        or to adversely affect the title of any property merely because of the redefinition of county boundaries.

        This section and § 30-5-153 are to be construed like patents or grants or segregations of a different date

                        When the general assembly stated the western boundary of Jefferson county and ran the line south from the junction of North and South Clear creeks it ran a line due south making allowance for the magnetic variation, and it must strike the Platte river
                        at the point where that line thus projected would strike the stream. Link v. Jones, 15 Colo. App. 281, 62 P. 339 (1900).

                    When a majority of the taxpaying electors residing in that portion of the territory of any county proposed to be stricken off and annexed to an adjoining county shall petition the board of county commissioners of the county in which such territory is
                    situate to have such portion stricken off and annexed to the adjoining county, giving the area and general boundaries of such territory by natural objects and monuments as near as may be, and shall deposit with such board of county
                    commissioners an amount of money sufficient to pay the expenses of the surveying and platting of such territory, it is the duty of the said commissioners to have such territory surveyed and platted in a suitable manner and to cause
                    to be submitted to the registered electors of such county at the general election next after the filing of such petition and plat with them the question of whether such portion of the territory of their county shall be so stricken
                    off. The board of county commissioners shall also require the county clerk and recorder, in giving the notice required by law of the general election then next ensuing, to insert therein a notice to said registered electors that the
                    question of striking off such territory from their county, particularly describing such territory by metes and bounds as shown by said survey, will be submitted to them for their approval or rejection and that they should designate
                    on their ballots their approval thereof, which shall be expressed by the words ”for the new county line“, or their dissent thereto, expressed by the words ”against the new county line“. The board of county commissioners of the county

       Editor’s note:
      </b> Subsection (10) of this section contained a provision that repealed the entire section effective August 5, 2003. Subsection (10) was deleted by amendment in House Bill 03-1239 to give continuing effect to the section. The
                    bill also amended subsection (8) and added a new subsection (8.5). This bill did not contain a safety clause. A bill without a safety clause usually takes effect on the day following the expiration of the ninety-day period after adjournment
                    of the general assembly. Therefore, House Bill 03-1239 would normally take effect on August 6, 2003, one day after the repeal of the section was to take effect. An argument could be made that the deletion of the repealer and the other
                    amendments to the section were of no effect because the repeal had already taken effect on the previous day. However, such an interpretation would defeat the general assembly’s purpose in enacting the bill. For that reason, if a court
                    is asked to address this circumstance, it could reach the conclusion that the amendment deleting the repeal should be given effect as of the date the governor signed the bill on April 22, 2003, rather than the technical effective date
                    (see People v. Tacorante, 624 P.2d 1324 (Colo. 1981), where a similar conclusion was reached). In view of these factors, the repeal of this section is not reflected in the version printed above; rather, the section appears as amended
                    by House Bill 03-1239.

                    When the boundary lines of any county in this state are so indefinite that a portion of territory, by reason of such indefinite description, is claimed by two counties, and such fact appears by petition of the board of county commissioners of either county
                    to the state engineer, it is the duty of such state engineer, in connection with the county surveyor of each of such counties, to run out and establish such lines as nearly as may be in accordance with such defective description, fix
                    and define such boundary line by monuments in accordance with rules issued by the state board of licensure for architects, professional engineers, and professional land surveyors, and to furnish the board of county commissioners of
                    each of said counties with a description of such line as soon thereafter as may be practical, deposit such survey as a land survey plat in each county, and file a Colorado land survey monument record on each monument found or set,
                    as specified in section 38-53-104. When such line is established it shall be the boundary line between said counties, unless one of said counties, within six months from the day of filing the description of said line by the state engineer
                    with the board of county commissioners of such county, commences an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in this state to determine and settle such disputed line, and prosecute the same with due diligence until its final determination,
                    or has settled such disputed line, within said six months, by arbitration. If the county surveyor of either of such counties shall not appear or assist the state engineer in making such survey after due notice so to do, it shall in
                    no manner affect or invalidate such survey, or the boundary lines as they may be fixed by such state engineer.

        It was purely a question for the general assembly as to whether the same rule should be adopted as to residence in the case of an election to locate a county seat,
       </b> as § 2 of art. XIV, Colo. Const., had already adopted in the case of an election upon the question of removal of a county seat, and the length of residence required in the latter case was definitely fixed by the constitution,
                        and the general assembly was left free to determine the qualifications of voters at an election upon the question of the location of a county seat, unquestionably, since there is no specific constitutional inhibition, and the statute
                        is general, applying alike to all similarly situated, the general assembly had the power and authority to enact it. Town of Sugar City v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).

        Instant vacancy upon conviction.

                        ipso facto, without difference of treatment in the statute, is significant, thus, among the listed events creating a vacancy in office are three which by their very nature result in termination of office holding, and the statutory
                        declaration that the office becomes vacant upon the happening thereof seems almost surplusage; also reference is made to the provisions relating to the death of an incumbent, or his resignation, or his removal; the occurrence of
                        any of these events establishes instanter a vacancy; and to hold that the death of an incumbent, or his resignation, or his removal effects an immediate vacancy in the office but that the same is not true as to an officer convicted
                        of either of the described offenses would result in a strained, unnatural and illogical construction, in view of the language employed in the statute which makes no such distinction. People v. Enlow, 135 Colo. 249, 310 P.2d 539

                        requires us to hold that, as to the latter, the general assembly purposely omitted words which would have given effect to foreign convictions, because to ascertain the intent of the general assembly enacting a particular statute,

                        did not invalidate the later action of the board in adopting the plan, because it is desirable for commissioners to seek the sentiments of various citizens and it is not improper for them to state their views on matters which will
                        later come before them for action. Allen v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 178 Colo. 354, 497 P.2d 1026 (1972).

        Public record defined.
       </b> It is said that a public record is one required by law to be kept, or necessary to be kept, in the discharge of a duty imposed by law, or directed by law to serve as a memorial and evidence of something written, said,
                        or done. Treat v. McDonough, 148 Colo. 603, 367 P.2d 587 (1961).

                        Tract indices kept by the county clerk and recorder for the purpose of preparing abstracts of title, even though not within the terms of the statute, constitute an appropriate mode of discharging the clerk’s duties, hence, it was not only his right but
                        his duty to keep them and having done so they became public property subject to public use as provided by statute. Treat v. McDonough, 148 Colo. 603, 367 P.2d 587 (1961).

        General public right to inspect or copy public records.
       </b> At common law, due to land ownership by a very limited number of people, there was no general public right to inspect or copy public records; however, this concept later gave way, particularly in the United States,
                        to a recognition of such a right due to our belief in widespread ownership of real property. Treat v. McDonough, 148 Colo. 603, 367 P.2d 587 (1961).

        But a wide discretion was necessarily vested in the county clerk with reference to permitting the examination of the records

                        perhaps, that abstracters had to be allowed to examine and make copies from these records they were in so doing subjected to such reasonable regulations as the county clerk prescribed. Upton v. Catlin, 17 Colo. 546, 31 P. 172 (1892).

                        The right of an abstractor to inspect and make memoranda of the contents of the records, etc., in the county clerk’s office, is subordinate to the right of the clerk and recorder so to regulate his office as to maintain the sanctity of the records, etc.,

                        required to be kept open under the law, between the hours of nine and twelve in the forenoon, and one and four in the afternoon; provided, that on the days when the county commissioners are in session in the office, said memoranda
                        and copies may be made between the hours of nine and ten in the forenoon and four and five in the afternoon, and at no other times during said days, was held a reasonable regulation. Upton v. Catlin, 17 Colo. 546, 31 P. 172, (1892).

        Under this section, articles of incorporation, when so recorded, may be used in evidence for the purpose of establishing any fact other than that of corporate existence;

                        not this exclusive character, but any other legal proof is admitted. Thus, the date of incorporation is a secondary fact, and could be proved by collateral circumstances or parol evidence. Schiffer v. Adams, 13 Colo. 572, 22 P.

                    It is the duty of any sheriff transporting prisoners to a correctional facility, as defined in section 17-1-102, C.R.S., or other place of confinement to convey to such facility or other place of confinement at one time all prisoners who may have been
                    convicted and sentenced and who are ready for such transportation. If any sheriff fails or neglects to carry out the provisions of this section, the boards of county commissioners may disallow any such sheriff’s bill for such extra
                    trips as in their discretion are unnecessary. This section shall not apply to the transportation of the insane.

                <p>
                    It is the duty of the county treasurer to assess, at a fair value, the property of any person liable to pay taxes which the county assessor has failed to assess, to place the same on the tax roll, and to collect taxes on the same in the manner provided
                    by law. Such treasurer shall not be compelled to assess such property in person; and he is authorized to administer oaths to such persons, or any others, touching the value of said property.

                        the assessor to bear the expenses thus necessarily incurred; having paid the clerks, the assessor’s right to reimbursement, although not covered by the express terms of this section, may be fairly implied therefrom, also the power

                        contract is ultra vires and void, because the right to employ capable assistants comes within the purview of the duties primarily conferred on the assessor and cannot be claimed as an implied power of the board of county commissioners,

        The board of county commissioners was a proper party and entitled to recover damages against the building contractor and his surety
       </b> under third party beneficiary principles, because in Colorado one may enforce a contractual obligation made for his benefit although he was not a party to the agreement, when such an obligation is apparent from the
                        agreement and the surrounding circumstances. The obligation for the benefit of the county is inherent in the contract documents and circumstances. Under the leasehold agreement, the public building authority’s obligation to the
                        county to construct the courthouse building was recognized, and the building plans and specifications were subject to the approval of the county. Under the construction agreement, the county has the right to approve the form of
                        the performance bond. The contractor was not entitled to final payment until completion of the building and final acceptance of work by the authority, the county and the architects. The land belonged to the county and was leased
                        to the authority to have the courthouse built and to lease the land and building back to the county. Thus, the agreements and the circumstances show that the benefit of faithful performance of the construction agreement and the
                        bond were intended to flow to the county. Such contractual benefit to the property owner is enforceable by him. Cox v. Fremont County Pub. Bldg. Auth., 415 F.2d 882 (10th Cir. 1969).

                    lease was originally granted in order to conform such lease to the terms and provisions of such unit agreement and to facilitate the efficient and economic production of oil and gas from the unit lands.

        Club that offered nude entertainment was ”open to the public“ and therefore subject to county regulation pursuant to subsection (1)(l).
       </b> The club was not a private club, despite claims to the contrary, because: The club was not genuinely selective of its members; the membership fee was minimal; the club members had no control over the club’s operations;
                        the formalities of a private club such as by-laws and membership meetings were not present; the club was only recently converted to a private format and was advertised as being open to the public and in business in the same location

        Trial court erred in determining that county possesses requisite authority to require that private access road across ranch parcels comply with county’s fire code and its access requirements.
       </b> The ”farms or ranches“ exception to the provisions of § 30-15-401.5 (3) found in § 30-15-401.5 (6) does not refer to access, roads, or the purposes thereof. Instead, it refers to the use or status of the land. If the
                        land traversed by the road currently satisfies the ”farms or ranches“ exception, then so long as the fundamental character of the land does not change in a manner that would make the exception inapplicable, the county may not regulate
                        the road under subsection (1) of this section. Zweygardt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs of Elbert County, 190 P.3d 848 (Colo. App. 2008).

                        Whether a private road that begins at a public road, crosses various parcels, and dead-ends on private land may be regulated in its entirety or not at all should be determined by the predominant use of the private land that it crosses. The predominant
                        use of these various parcels may change, which will affect whether, at some point in time, the county can require the entire road to comply with its fire code, although some parcels may still meet the ”farm and ranch“ exception.

        Trial court erred in determining that county possesses requisite authority to require that private access road across ranch parcels comply with county’s fire code and its access requirements.
       </b> The ”farms or ranches“ exception to the provisions of subsection (3) found in subsection (6) does not refer to access, roads, or the purposes thereof. Instead, it refers to the use or status of the land. If the land
                        traversed by the road currently satisfies the ”farms or ranches“ exception, then so long as the fundamental character of the land does not change in a manner that would make the exception inapplicable, the county may not regulate
                        the road under § 30-15-401 (1). Zweygardt v. Bd. of County Comm’rs of Elbert County, 190 P.3d 848 (Colo. App. 2008).

                        Whether a private road that begins at a public road, crosses various parcels, and dead-ends on private land may be regulated in its entirety or not at all should be determined by the predominant use of the private land that it crosses. The predominant
                        use of these various parcels may change, which will affect whether, at some point in time, the county can require the entire road to comply with its fire code, although some parcels may still meet the ”farm and ranch“ exception.

                                        Community wildfire protection plans, or CWPPs, are authorized and defined in section 101 of Title I of the federal ”Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003“, Pub.L. 108-148, referred to in this section as ”HFRA“. Title I of HFRA authorizes the secretaries
                                        of agriculture and the interior to expedite the development and implementation of hazardous fuel reduction projects on federal lands managed by the United States forest service and the bureau of land management
                                        when these agencies meet certain conditions. HFRA emphasizes the need for federal agencies to work collaboratively with local communities in developing hazardous fuel reduction projects, placing priority on treatment
                                        areas identified by the local communities themselves in a CWPP. The wild land-urban interface area is one of the identified property areas that qualify under HFRA for the use of this expedited environmental review
                                        process.

                                        The development of a CWPP can assist a local community in clarifying and refining its priorities for the protection of life, property, and critical infrastructure in its wildland-urban interface area. The CWPP brings together diverse federal, state, and
                                        local interests to discuss their mutual concerns for public safety, community sustainability, and natural resources. The CWPP process offers a positive, solution-oriented environment in which to address challenges
                                        such as local fire-fighting capability, the need for defensible space around homes and housing developments, and where and how to prioritize land management on both federal and nonfederal lands. CWPPs can be as
                                        simple or complex as a local community desires.

                    It is the intent of the general assembly in the enactment of this part 1 to enable each county to provide a means of temporary general assistance to poor persons who reside in the county or to transients. Such temporary general assistance is necessarily
                    restricted by the limited ability of county government to make appropriations therefor.

                    to local improvements authorized in section 30-20-603 (11.5), the owner for each property included in the district shall retain all rights otherwise existing by contract or by law against parties other than the county with respect

                        remanufactured, reclaimed, or recycled, waste tires are a recyclable material as defined in section 30-20-101 (4). As recyclable materials, waste tires must be collected, managed, and transported in accordance with the manifest
                        system required by section 30-20-1417 (2) and recycled into tire-derived product, thereby being transformed from a recyclable material into a new product. The department shall consider tires that have been collected under a tire

                <p>
                    Agricultural crop and livestock producers are constantly faced with the problem of new insects, diseases, depletion of soil fertility, lack of information as to market demands and preferences, and of other distributive practices. Some counties have need
                    for more research work than others. Such counties, if placed in a position to provide for agricultural research work with laboratory facilities, management, and some labor, would be able to cooperate with the technical personnel of
                    the state and federal research agencies and better meet these local demands for research work.

                        words, the general assembly intended to compel the board of county commissioners to particularize the purposes to which the moneys should be applied, and by this means all subsequent diversion of the public funds to illegal uses
                        because of personal, political, or other considerations, was substantially prevented. Beshoar v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 7 Colo. App. 444, 43 P. 912 (1896).

                        regularly issued for unquestioned obligations of the county, and paid by the treasurer were to be credited to him in his account, in spite of the absence of any formal appropriation resolution, such as required by the former section,

        Rental payments.

                        upheld, because the rent is to be paid monthly, and it is a current expense and is to be provided for, the same as the other current expenses, by annual levy and appropriation. Leadville Illuminating Gas Co. v. City of Leadville,

                <p>
                    When any claim of any person against a county is disallowed, in whole or in part, by the board of county commissioners, such person may appeal from the decision of such board to the district court for the same county by causing a written notice of such
                    appeal to be served on the clerk of such board within thirty days after the making of such decision and executing a bond to such county, with sufficient security, to be approved by the clerk of said board, conditioned for the faithful
                    prosecution of such appeal and the payment of all costs that are adjudged against the appellant.

       </b> it is but the substitution of new evidence for a preexisting debt, it changes the form, but does not increase the indebtedness. Bd. of Comm’rs v. Standley, 24 Colo. 1, 49 P. 23 (1897).

        Validity of each bond tested by validity of each debt.
       </b> When, in compliance with this section, the county issued a bond in exchange for outstanding valid warrants, its validity could in no way be affected by the fact that other bonds in the same series, issued in exchange
                        for invalid warrants, were unauthorized and void, the validity of each bond, therefore, must be tested by the character of the indebtedness for which it is exchanged, because it is an independent contract, and when issued for preexisting
                        indebtedness, it becomes a valid enforceable obligation against the county. Bd. of Comm’rs v. Standley, 24 Colo. 1, 49 P. 23 (1897).

       </b> In an action upon coupons the county funding bonds issued under this section, where the defense set up in the answer was that the bonds were invalid because the county warrants for which the bonds were exchanged were
                        issued in excess of the limit of indebtedness allowed by the constitution, when plaintiff produced in evidence his coupons and the bonds to which they were attached, regularly and in due form executed by the authorized officers
                        of the county and with the county seal attached, the presumption was that they were valid, and the same presumption attached to the warrants similarly executed and tested which became merged in the bonds, introduced in evidence

        Constitutionality.
       </b> Section 6 of art. XI, Colo. Const., providing that any county may contract a debt by loan by the issuance of bonds for the purpose of liquidating the indebtedness incurred prior to December 31, 1886, does not repeal
                        by implication this section, or prevent counties from funding, under it, valid obligations incurred subsequent to said date, viz., December 31, 1886. Opinion of the Justices, 15 Colo. 421, 24 P. 877 (1890).

        Duty to evaluate vote and amount of indebtedness.
       </b> This section entrusted the power and imposed the duty upon the commissioners to examine, to see and to decide whether or not a favorable vote had been taken, and whether or not the amount of the indebtedness exceeded
                        the limitation, whenever they considered the question of issuing the bonds, and they could not discharge their duty in the issuance of these bonds without a consideration and determination of these questions. Bd. of Comm’rs v.

        ”Roads“ defined.
       </b> To restrict the term ”roads“ to the definition of that term under the conditions of the time, and which had acceptance in the year 1876, when the constitution was adopted, would be most unreasonable, the word has a
                        much broader meaning and may be said to include ”overland ways of every character“ even though not then envisioned by the framers of the constitution, and the airports of this nation are links in the transportation system, hence
                        runways and landing strips, being a necessary unit of that system, need no longer be regarded as unique or peculiar, hence, they are as logically within the term ”roads“ as are automobile highways, and the statute authorizing such
                        a bond issue is not unconstitutional. Hale v. Sullivan, 146 Colo. 512, 362 P.2d 402 (1961).

                    The board of county commissioners, when authorized as provided in section 30-26-301, may make and issue coupon bonds of the county not exceeding the amounts authorized by the electors, payable at the pleasure of the county but absolutely due and payable
                    twenty years after such date, bearing interest at a rate such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds does not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate authorized, payable annually or semiannually; such interest
                    and principal, when due, shall be payable at the office of the county treasurer of the county or at such other location as the board of county commissioners may designate. The board of county commissioners shall prescribe the form
                    of said bonds and the coupons thereto; and, to provide for the principal and interest and redemption premiums accruing on the bonds, it shall provide for the levying of a tax which, together with such other revenue, assets, or funds
                    as may be pledged, will be sufficient to pay the principal, interest and redemption premiums, if any, accruing on the bonds.

                        ”Subdivision improvements agreement“ means one or more security arrangements which a county shall accept to secure the actual cost of construction of such public improvements as are required by county subdivision regulations within the subdivision. The
                        ”subdivision improvements agreement“ may include any one or a combination of the types of security or collateral listed in this subsection (11), and the subdivider may substitute security in order to release portions of the subdivision
                        for sale. The types of collateral which may be used as security under the ”subdivision improvements agreement“ are as follows: Restrictions on the conveyance, sale, or transfer of any lot, lots, tract, or tracts of land within
                        the subdivision as set forth on the plat or as recorded by separate instrument; performance or property bonds; private or public escrow agreements; loan commitments; assignments of receivables; liens on property; letters of credit;
                        deposits of certified funds; or other similar surety agreements. Security, other than plat restrictions, required under the ”subdivision improvements agreement“ shall equal in value the cost of improvements to be completed but
                        shall not be required on the portion of the subdivision subject to plat restriction. The county shall not require security arrangements with collateral arrangements in excess of the actual cost of construction of the public improvements.
                        The amount of security may be incrementally reduced as subdivision improvements are completed.

        County had authority under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act, article 20 of title 29 (enabling act), to impose temporary moratorium on developmental approvals concerning certain land within county.

                    plan or any part, amendment, extension, or addition shall be by resolution carried by the affirmative votes of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the commission. The resolution shall refer expressly to the maps and

                    From time to time the board of county commissioners may amend the number, shape, boundaries, or area of any district, or any regulation of or within such district, or any other provisions of the zoning resolution. Any such amendment shall not be made
                    or become effective unless the same has been proposed by or is first submitted for the approval, disapproval, or suggestions of the county planning commission. If disapproved by such commission within thirty days after such submission,
                    such amendment, to become effective, shall receive the favorable vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the board of county commissioners. Before finally adopting any such amendment, the board of county commissioners
                    shall hold a public hearing thereon, and at least fourteen days’ notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given by at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

        Section does not conflict with, preempt, or control necessarily implied authority of a local government under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act (enabling act) to adopt a reasonable moratorium of sufficient duration to prepare a master plan.

                        of zoning plan adoption: The local government is permitted to adopt a moratorium for a six-month period without a public hearing. Droste v. Bd. of County Comm’rs of Pitkin, 159 P.3d 601 (Colo. 2007).

        County had authority under the Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act (enabling act) to impose temporary moratorium on developmental approvals concerning certain land within county.
       </b> The enabling act is designed to give the local governments additional or supplemental powers for the purposes set forth in the act, including development in hazardous areas, protecting wildlife habitats, protecting
                        areas of historical or archeological significance, controlling population density, and providing for the phasing in of infrastructure. These special considerations, in many instances, supplement those normally involved in creating
                        a zoning master plan or administering a zoning regimen. Accordingly, the enabling act and this article (county planning statute) have different, though complementary, purposes, and the limitation on temporary zoning authorized
                        by this section does not prohibit or limit a moratorium on development for the purpose of conducting studies under the enabling act. Droste v. Bd. of County Comm’rs of Pitkin, 141 P.3d 852 (Colo. App. 2005), aff’d, 159 P.3d 601

                        penalty ordered by the county court and assessed under this subsection (1) shall, as of recording, be a lien against the property on which the violation has been found to exist. In case the assessment is not paid within thirty

                        costs required to operate that department for purposes of imposing fees for building department services. Fees generated must generally approximate the overall costs of operating the building department to prevent the fees from
                        constituting an unlawful tax in violation of the state constitutional provision mandating uniform property taxation. Bainbridge, Inc. v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 964 P.2d 575 (Colo. App. 1998).

        On remand, trial court correctly concluded that general governmental expenses relating to growth management are recoverable from builders under subsection (1) of this section and § 30-28-114 through permit fees charged as indirect costs.
       </b> Evidence demonstrated that growth has driven the costs of the county’s building department. The evidence also supports the finding that the fees charged by the building department were approximately required to offset
                        the direct and indirect costs of operating the department. Mathematical exactitude is not required. Thus, it was permissible for part of the growth costs to be allocated to the building department as indirect costs. Bainbridge,

                        It is unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, maintain, or use any building, structure, or land in violation of this part 2 or any provisions of the area building code. In addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to section 30-28-209, any
                        person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this part 2 or any provision of the area building code may be subject to the imposition, by order of the county court, of a civil penalty in an amount of not less than five
                        hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. It is within the discretion of the county attorney to determine whether to pursue the civil penalties set forth in this section, the remedies set forth in section 30-28-209, or
                        both. Each day after the issuance of the order of the county court during which such unlawful activity continues shall be deemed a separate violation and shall in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this section, be the
                        subject of a continuing penalty in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars for each such day. Until paid, any civil penalty ordered by the county court and assessed under this subsection (1) shall, as of recording, be a lien
                        against the property on which the violation has been found to exist. In case the assessment is not paid within thirty days, it may be certified by the county attorney to the county treasurer, who shall collect the assessment, together
                        with a ten percent penalty for the cost of collection, in the same manner as other taxes are collected. The laws of this state for assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale and redemption of property
                        for taxes, shall apply to the collection of assessments pursuant to this subsection (1). Any lien placed against the property pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be recorded with the clerk and recorder of the county in which
                        the property is located.

                        The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, in certain areas of the state, property has been conveyed as irregular parcels or as parcels platted prior to establishment of current subdivision regulations. Situations exist where the physical layout
                        of lots conveyed in this manner are not in dispute, but the legal descriptions of these lots contain inaccuracies such that conflicts exist in the written record locating property boundaries. These conflicts in the legal descriptions
                        jeopardize the ability of property owners to utilize and to convey their property. These conflicts often affect a number of properties such that the most efficient means of correcting them is to create a subdivision exemption plat

                    fully to discharge such interest. For the ultimate payment or redemption of such refunding bonds there shall be certified and levied annually such a tax upon all the taxable property in such county as will create a fund sufficient

                    for payment of the bonds to be refunded if no refunding of said bonds had been made and accomplished. As collected, all taxes levied for payment of interest on and for the payment or redemption of the principal of such bonds shall
                    be kept by the treasurer of the county in a special fund, to be used only in the payment of the interest upon and for the payment or redemption of the principal of such bonds. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner
