         The most economically efficient time to develop children's skills and social abilities is in the very early years when developmental education across all of the four domains of early learning, family support and education, health care, social-emotional health, and mental health, can have the most effect;

       The general assembly finds and declares that there is a critical need to increase services for young children and their families, including those families with members who are entering the workforce due to Colorado's reform of the welfare system, making the transition off of welfare, or needing child care assistance to avoid the welfare system. The statewide need includes increasing and sustaining the quality, accessibility, capacity, and affordability of services for children and their parents to help parents raise their children to be successful at school, at work, and in the community.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a02p02s26.5-2-201ol12">
       Research demonstrates that there are positive outcomes for young children and their families who receive quality, integrated child care and related services in their early, preschool years, delivered through a comprehensive early childhood system that includes quality care and education, family support, health, and mental health programs.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a02p02s26.5-2-201ol13">
       Providers of half-day preschool and full-day child care services have to overcome barriers and inflexible requirements of the various sources of funding in order to design and implement programs that are more responsive to the needs of working families.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a02p02s26.5-2-201ol14">
       Consideration of various state and federal funding sources would allow for an integrated delivery system of quality programs for young children and their families in Colorado's communities.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a02p02s26.5-2-201ol15">
       An integrated delivery system would further enhance the ability of the department to identify the best practices relative to increasing and sustaining quality and to meeting the diverse needs of families seeking child care and other early childhood services.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a02p02s26.5-2-201ol16">
       Distinctly local needs and conditions require that the state design and integrate a system that has the flexibility to adapt to those local needs.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a02p02s26.5-2-201ol17">
       It is therefore in the state's best interest to establish a comprehensive system of early childhood councils to increase and sustain the availability, accessibility, capacity, and quality of early childhood services throughout the state, as provided in this part 2.

       The general assembly declares that Colorado needs healthy and cohesive families at all income levels in order for the state to be economically viable. A number of families in communities throughout Colorado temporarily may not have access to the basic necessities of life or to resources or services designed to promote individual development and family growth.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a03p01s26.5-3-101ol12">
       The general assembly further declares that many of Colorado's vulnerable families, individuals, children, and youth do not necessarily live in at-risk neighborhoods. These persons may not have appropriate resources or sufficient income for adequate housing, health care, or child care because the primary wage earners are unemployed or underemployed or work at jobs that pay minimum wage or less. Further, many of these persons not only live in poverty but also experience divorce or domestic violence or are single parents. Children and youth who are raised in vulnerable families experience an increased risk of being abused, being illiterate, being undereducated, dropping out of school, becoming teen parents, abusing drugs, and engaging in at-risk behaviors, including but not limited to criminal activities. These children and youth are often influenced by and likely to repeat behaviors that began with their parents.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a03p01s26.5-3-101ol13">
       Therefore, the general assembly finds that it is appropriate to establish a program to provide family resource centers in communities to serve as a single point of entry for providing comprehensive, intensive, integrated, and collaborative state and community-based services to vulnerable families, individuals, children, and youth.

       Private health insurance carriers that are required to make payment of benefits for early intervention services for which coverage is required pursuant to section 10-16-104 (1.3) shall pay benefits to the department in trust for payment to a broker or provider for early intervention services provided to an eligible child.

         When a private health insurance carrier makes payments of benefits for an eligible child to the department in trust, the money must be deposited in the early intervention services trust fund, which trust fund is created in the state treasury. Except as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section, the principal of the trust fund must only be used to pay certified early intervention service brokers or qualified early intervention service providers for early intervention services provided to the eligible child for whom the money was paid to the department in trust by the private health insurance carrier. Except as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section, the principal of the trust fund does not constitute state fiscal year spending for purposes of section 20 of article X of the state constitution, and the money is deemed custodial funds that are not subject to appropriation by the general assembly.

Any money deposited in the trust fund on behalf of an eligible child that is not expended on behalf of the child before the child becomes ineligible must be returned to the carrier that made the payments in trust for the child.

       The general assembly finds that in order to adequately care for their newborns and young children, new mothers may often benefit from receiving professional assistance and information. Without such assistance and information, a young mother may develop habits or practices that are detrimental to her health and well-being and the health and well-being of her child. The general assembly further finds that inadequate prenatal care and inadequate care in infancy and early childhood often inhibit a child's ability to learn and develop throughout the child's childhood and may have lasting, adverse effects on the child's ability to function as an adult. The general assembly recognizes that implementation of a nurse home visitor program that provides educational, health, and other resources for new young mothers during pregnancy and the first years of their infants' lives has been proven to significantly reduce the amount of drug, including nicotine, and alcohol use and abuse by mothers, the occurrence of criminal activity committed by mothers and their children under fifteen years of age, and the number of reported incidents of child abuse and neglect. Such a program has also been proven to reduce the number of subsequent births, increase the length of time between subsequent births, and reduce the mother's need for other forms of public assistance. It is the intent of the general assembly that such a program be established for the state of Colorado, beginning with a limited number of participants and expanding by the year 2010 to be available to all low-income, first-time mothers in the state who consent to receiving services.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a03p05s26.5-3-502ol12">
       The general assembly further finds that, to implement such a program efficiently and effectively and to promote the successful implementation of partnerships between state public entities and the private sector, responsibility for the program should be divided between the department, which is responsible for financial administration of the program, and a health sciences facility at the university of Colorado, which is responsible for programmatic and clinical support, evaluation, and monitoring for the program, and such other responsibilities as described in this part 5. It is the intent of the general assembly that the department and the health sciences facility work collaboratively to share information in order to promote efficient and effective program implementation; however, neither entity is responsible for the other entity's statutorily prescribed duties.

        <li id="t26.5a03p06s26.5-3-601ol11a">
         Young children from low-income families often struggle to achieve the same outcomes as their peers from higher-income families because they rarely have access to the same supports, particularly those supports with a focus on the development of social-emotional skills like emotion regulation, pro-social communication, and problem solving;
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p06s26.5-3-601ol11b">
         Exposure to poverty, a stressful home environment, and delays in the development of behavioral and academic skills at a young age are strong predictors of later academic challenges, health issues, behavior problems, substance abuse, lower educational attainment, lower rates of employment, teen parenthood, and the likely recurrence of these risk factors for the next generation of children;
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p06s26.5-3-601ol11c">
         Research demonstrates that the opportunity to support positive development experiences during early childhood using evidence-based interventions that support sensitive and responsive caregiver-child interactions are linked to children's academic and social competence; and
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p06s26.5-3-601ol11d">
         Helping teachers and parents learn when and how to use these evidence-based interventions has demonstrated reductions in parental depression and increases in parental self-confidence; increases in positive family communication and problem solving; increases in children's appropriate cognitive problem-solving strategies and in the use of pro-social conflict management strategies with peers; reductions in conduct problems at home and conduct problems in school that often lead to suspension and expulsion; and increases in children's positive affect and cooperation, positive interactions with peers, school readiness, and engagement with school activities.

        <li id="t26.5a03p06s26.5-3-601ol12a">
         The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is in the best interests of the state to authorize the department to implement proven, evidence-based, two-generation prevention programs to teach teachers and parents strategies and skills to connect with all children, especially those who demonstrate challenging behaviors; to promote children's social competence; to reduce behavior problems; and to provide programming to children to help them learn problem-solving and emotion-control skills. The goals of providing these programs are to strengthen teacher-child and parent-child relationships and promote child behavioral change, including self-regulation and decreased aggressive behavior and impulsivity.

        <li id="t26.5a03p06s26.5-3-601ol12b">
         The general assembly further finds that, to implement these programs efficiently and effectively and to promote successful partnerships between state agencies and the private sector, it is appropriate to divide responsibility for the programs between the department, which is responsible for financial administration of the programs, and an implementation partner, which is responsible for programmatic and clinical support, evaluation, and monitoring for the programs, and such other responsibilities as may be described in this part 6. It is the intent of the general assembly that the department and the implementation partner work collaboratively to share information as necessary to promote efficient and effective program implementation.

     <ol>
      <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11">
       The general assembly finds and declares that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11a">
         Colorado's economic recovery depends on its workforce having access to stable, high-quality, and affordable child care. Supporting the ability of Colorado's workforce to return to work during and after the COVID-19 public health emergency is estimated to have an economic enabling effect of more than four billion four hundred million dollars in income.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11b">
         The COVID-19 public health emergency has significantly impacted Colorado's child care sector by reducing child care provider revenues while at the same time increasing expenses. Child care provider operating costs have increased to include additional daily cleaning, daily health monitoring, supplying personal protective equipment for child care workers, and lower staff-to-child ratios to allow for sufficient physical distancing.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11c">
         In Colorado, this additional cost burden has forced ten percent of the state's child care providers to close their doors since March 2020. Almost three-quarters of all child care providers indicate they have or will engage in layoffs, furloughs, or pay cuts. For minority-owned or operated child care providers, this figure is even higher. More than twenty-five percent of existing child care providers report that closure is imminent without some kind of financial intervention.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11d">
         Child care providers generate revenue primarily through enrollment and tuition fees and the business model depends on full enrollment;
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11e">
         At every stage of the COVID-19 public health emergency, parents have been faced with the difficult choice to pull their children from child care, either due to health concerns or because the economic recession has impacted their ability to afford it. Statewide, enrollment in child care for children less than five years of age has decreased by thirty-nine percent since the COVID-19 public health emergency began.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11f">
         Colorado faces other ongoing threats to the child care sector's sustainability, including high turnover and low pay in the child care profession, as well as the prohibitively expensive cost of opening and operating a child care program;
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11g">
         More than half of Coloradans live in a "child care desert", where there are more than three children less than five years of age for each single available child care opening. Some rural areas completely lack licensed child care providers. Statewide, Colorado faces a dramatic shortage of at least thirty-nine thousand spots for infants and toddlers.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11h">
         Most child care in Colorado is owned or operated by women, and more than forty percent of our child care workforce is composed of women of color. Furthermore, throughout the COVID-19 public health emergency, women of color have been more likely to be on the front lines as essential workers and are more likely to lose their jobs.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11i">
         Despite women's steadily increasing labor participation rates and earning trajectories over the past twenty-five years, the COVID-19 public health emergency threatens to set back a generation of progress. When women exit the workforce, they face more barriers than men do to return, and their future earning potential and path to retirement security suffers.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol11j">
         Women have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency: Almost one hundred seventy-nine thousand women left Colorado's labor force between February and May 2020, compared to eighty-eight thousand men. Nationally, four times as many women as men dropped out of the labor force in September 2020 alone. The impact of this trend on the United States' economy and the well-being of women and families is estimated to amount to approximately sixty-four million five hundred thousand dollars in lost income and economic activity.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol12">
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol12a">
         Therefore, the general assembly finds it is a matter of statewide concern that we take immediate action to save and protect our child care infrastructure, including offering a wide range of child care options, including but not limited to public and private child care centers, day care centers, school-age child care centers, before- and after-school programs, nursery schools, kindergartens, preschools, church day care centers, day camps, summer camps, facilities for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and other facilities described in section 26.5-5-303. Supporting this mixed delivery of child care enables the state to invest in its children's futures, advance gender equity in the home and the workplace, and rebuild an economy that works for all Coloradans. When Colorado families have access to child care, everyone benefits.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p08s26.5-3-801ol12b">
         The general assembly further finds that, to assist the state's workforce in returning to work and maintaining employment without facing the difficult choice between working and accessing quality child care, it is critical that the state allocate and quickly distribute funding to existing and new child care providers throughout the state and that such actions constitute critical government services.

         Traditional methods of delivering family-strengthening service programs, which often require parents and their children to travel to a program site to access services delivered simultaneously to multiple families, often create barriers, such as limited access to transportation or creation of a stigma around receiving services, that prevent families, especially low-income families, from receiving the benefits of the services;
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p09s26.5-3-901ol11b">
         Evidence demonstrates that voluntary, high-quality, evidence-based programs that deliver family-strengthening support services help parents and other caregivers develop the skills and confidence needed to promote their children's healthy development and learning;

        <li id="t26.5a03p09s26.5-3-901ol11c">
         Home visiting is a service delivery strategy that is successfully used to deliver a wide array of high-quality, voluntary family-strengthening support services and that enables families to overcome barriers to access because the services are delivered in the home or other convenient settings, which are often selected by the family;
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p09s26.5-3-901ol11d">
         Home visiting is a service delivery strategy that can be leveraged to provide high-quality, voluntary, family-strengthening support services to more Colorado families who have fewer resources and are exposed to risk factors that may lead to poor outcomes in child development. Using home visiting to provide these services results in a strong return on investment by improving school readiness and helping Colorado's children reach their full potential.
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a03p09s26.5-3-901ol11e">
         Family-strengthening support services that are delivered through home visiting have also demonstrated improved family and child outcomes by promoting solid parent-child relationships, improving child and parental social-emotional and physical health, improving family economic security, identifying developmental delays early, providing timely child welfare intervention services, and preventing trauma and toxic stress.

      <li id="t26.5a03p09s26.5-3-901ol12">
       The general assembly finds, therefore, that authorizing grant programs to support home visiting programs that deliver high-quality, voluntary, family-strengthening support services is one of the best strategies available to support parents and other caregivers in preparing children for future success and ensure all Colorado children are ready to learn when they arrive at school.

Every county department shall adopt procedures for the resolution of disputes arising between the county department and an applicant for or recipient of child care assistance prior to appeal to the department. The procedures are referred to in this section as the "dispute resolution process". Two or more counties may jointly establish the dispute resolution process. The dispute resolution process must be consistent with department rules. The dispute resolution process must include an opportunity for all clients to have a county conference, upon the applicant's or recipient's request. This requirement may be met through a telephonic conference upon the agreement of the applicant or recipient and the county department. The dispute resolution process need not conform to the requirements of section 24-4-105, as long as the department rules include provisions specifically setting forth expeditious time frames, notice, and an opportunity to be heard and to present information. If the dispute is not resolved, the applicant or recipient may appeal to the department in the manner and form prescribed by department rules. County notices to applicants or recipients must inform them of the basis for the county's decision or action and must inform them of their rights to a county conference under the dispute resolution process and of their rights to state-level appeal and the process for making the appeal.

         Each county, either acting singly or with a group of counties, shall enter into an annual performance contract with the department that identifies the county's or group of counties' and the department's duties and responsibilities in implementing the child care assistance program. The performance contract must include, but need not be limited to, requirements and provisions that address each party's duties and responsibilities to work in a collaborative manner to administer, financially support, and implement the child care assistance program using fair and objective criteria.

       If, at any time during the continuance of child care assistance, the recipient becomes possessed of property having a value in excess of that amount set pursuant to the provisions of section 26.5-4-106 (4) and department rules or receives any increase in income, the recipient shall notify the county department of the possession of the property or receipt of the income, and the county department may either terminate the child care assistance or alter the amount of child care assistance in accordance with the circumstances and department rules. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, if the recipient is found to have committed an intentional program violation, the recipient is disqualified from participation in CCCAP for twelve months for the first incident, twenty-four months for a second incident, and permanently for a third or subsequent incident. This disqualification is mandatory and is in addition to any other penalty imposed by law. Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, any previously provided excess child care assistance to which the recipient was not entitled is recoverable by the county as a debt due to the state and the county in proportion to the amount of child care assistance paid by each respectively; except that interest is charged and paid to the county department on any sum fraudulently obtained, calculated at the legal rate and calculated from the date the sum was paid to a provider on behalf of the recipient to the date the sum is recovered. If the debt for fraudulently obtained child care assistance, fraudulently obtained overpayments of child care assistance, or excess child care assistance paid for which the recipient was ineligible has been reduced to a judgment in a court of record in this state, the county department may seek a continuing garnishment to collect the debt under article 54.5 of title 13.

       If, upon the death or mental incompetency of any recipient, the inventory of the recipient's estate shows assets in excess of the amount that the recipient was allowed to have in order to receive child care assistance, or if it be shown that the recipient was otherwise ineligible for child care assistance, then the claim of the county and state for the excess child care assistance paid for which the recipient was ineligible, if filed as required by section 15-12-804, has priority as a debt given preference under section 15-12-805 (1)(f.7).

      <li id="t26.5a04p01s26.5-4-116ol13">
       When a recipient was ineligible for child care assistance solely because of property in excess of that permitted by department rules pursuant to section 26.5-4-106 (4), the amount for which the recipient is liable is the amount by which the property exceeded the amount allowable under said rules or the total amount of child care assistance received, whichever is the lesser amount. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, actions for the recovery of these sums must be prosecuted by the county department or the department in a court of record that has jurisdiction.

       The department and a county department may elect not to attempt recovery of an overpayment of child care assistance from an individual who is no longer receiving public assistance or child care assistance if the overpayment amount is less than thirty-five dollars. If the overpayment amount owed by an individual who is no longer receiving public assistance or child care assistance is thirty-five dollars or more, the department and the county department may determine, consistent with the six-year time limitation for the execution on judgments involving state debt, that it is no longer cost-effective to continue to pursue recovery of the overpayment.

           In the 2001-02 fiscal year and in every fiscal year since, the increases to statewide base per pupil funding have automatically applied to funding for preschool services provided by school districts, because the funding for preschool services has been calculated through the school finance formula established in article 54 of title 22, which applies to funding for public elementary and secondary education;

          <li id="t26.5a04p02s26.5-4-202ol12aIII">
           To effectively and efficiently provide preschool services through a mixed delivery system of school- and community-based preschool providers, and to ensure that funding calculations account for the unique standards and features of preschool programs, state funding for preschool services, including preschool services for children with disabilities, must be appropriated and allocated separately from the funding for public elementary and secondary education, and, beginning in the 2023-24 fiscal year, the statewide base per pupil funding amount set annually for public elementary and secondary education will no longer apply to funding for preschool services;
          </li>
          <li id="t26.5a04p02s26.5-4-202ol12aIV">
           To continue to meet the intent of section 17 (1) of article IX of the state constitution with regard to funding for preschool services, it is appropriate for the department of early childhood to establish a per-child constitutional compliance rate for the 2023-24 fiscal year that equals the portion of the statewide base per pupil funding amount established for the 2023-24 fiscal year that applies to the number of hours of universal preschool services provided to an eligible child, and to increase the per-child constitutional compliance rate annually by the rate of inflation.

        <li id="t26.5a04p02s26.5-4-202ol12b">
         The general assembly, therefore, declares that, by establishing a per-child constitutional compliance rate and ensuring that the per-child rate that the department annually establishes for universal preschool services and for preschool services provided to children who are three years of age or younger meets or exceeds the per-child constitutional compliance rate, funding for the Colorado universal preschool program substantially complies with the requirements of section 17 (1) of article IX of the state constitution.

          <li id="t26.5a04p02s26.5-4-202ol13aII">
           Research demonstrates that participating in high-quality preschool programs helps to ensure that children in low-income families are able to enter kindergarten on par with their peers in higher-income families; and

         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t26.5a04p02s26.5-4-202ol13b">
         The general assembly finds, therefore, that it is in the best interests of the state to allocate the amount appropriated for the Colorado universal preschool program to provide adequate funding for both a high-quality universal preschool program and additional preschool programming for children in low-income families.

The general assembly declares that, for purposes of section 17 of article IX of the state constitution, meeting the obligation of serving all three- and four-year-old children with disabilities through the Colorado universal preschool program is an important element of expanding the availability of preschool programs and may therefore receive funding from the state education fund created in section 17 (4) of article IX of the state constitution.

The department may choose to distribute funding pursuant to this subsection (1)(d) only after the department allocates the amounts necessary to fund preschool services for eligible children who are three years of age or younger, up to the amounts described in subsection (2)(c) of this section, and to fully fund universal preschool services for all eligible children who enroll.

       On and after July 1, 2018, and continuing thereafter subject to sufficient and available federal funding, there is created the school-readiness quality improvement program, referred to in this section as the "program", which is administered by the department as part of the Colorado shines system. The department shall award school-readiness quality improvement funding to eligible early childhood councils identified or established throughout the state pursuant to section 26.5-2-203. The department shall award school-readiness quality improvement funding to improve the school readiness of children five years of age and younger who are enrolled in early childhood education programs. The department shall award school-readiness quality improvement funding to eligible early childhood councils based on allocations made at the discretion of the department and subject to available funding. Nothing in this section or in any rules promulgated pursuant to this section creates a legal entitlement in any early childhood council to school-readiness quality improvement funding.

      Counties are urged to partner with for-profit or not-for-profit organizations that evaluate the quality of early childhood care and education programs in the early childhood councils and assign ratings in an effort to assess the success of such programs and to improve the ultimate delivery of early childhood care and education. Counties so partnering are further encouraged to match private investments in such early childhood care and education programs with county block grant money for Colorado works pursuant to part 7 of article 2 of title 26 and federal child care development funds in an effort to improve the overall quality of those programs. Counties so partnering are further encouraged to expend local funds to promote the objectives of this part 1 and improve the delivery of early childhood services, including the continuation of those funding sources developed to support pilot site agency activities.

       26.5-5-203. Colorado infant and toddler quality and availability grant program - creation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to available appropriations, there is created in the department the Colorado infant and toddler quality and availability grant program. Grants are awarded through the Colorado shines system to improve quality in licensed infant and toddler care and increase the number of low-income infants and toddlers served through high-quality early childhood education programs, as well as promote voluntary family partnerships, as determined for the Colorado shines system. A program is considered "high quality" if it is rated in the top three levels of the state's Colorado shines system. Early childhood councils may apply for money through the department, which administers the program as part of the Colorado shines system. An early childhood education program that is within the service area of an early childhood council may apply to the early childhood council for money that would allow the program to increase the number of infants and toddlers living in low-income families served through high-quality early childhood education programs.

       26.5-5-302. Legislative declaration concerning the protections afforded by regulation.

     </h3>

      <li id="t26.5a05p03s26.5-5-302ol11">
       The general assembly finds and declares that increasing numbers of children in Colorado are spending a significant portion of their day in care settings outside their own homes. The general assembly finds that regulation and licensing of child care facilities contribute to a safe and healthy environment for children. The provision of such environment affords benefits to children, their families, their communities, and the larger society. The general assembly acknowledges that there is a need to balance accessibility and quality of care when regulating child care facilities. It is the intent of the general assembly that those who regulate and those who are regulated work together to meet the needs of the children, their families, and the child care industry.
      </li>
      <li id="t26.5a05p03s26.5-5-302ol12">
       In balancing the needs of children and their families with the needs of the child care industry, the general assembly also recognizes the financial demands with which the department is faced in its attempt to ensure a safe and sanitary environment for those children of the state of Colorado who are in child care facilities. In an effort to reduce the risk to children outside their homes while recognizing the financial constraints placed upon the department, it is the intent of the general assembly that the limited resources available be focused primarily on those child care facilities that have demonstrated that children in their care may be at higher risk pursuant to section 26.5-5-316.

       26.5-5-305. Public preschool provider - licensing - rules.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Public preschool providers are subject to the requirements of this part 3. Because of the unique circumstances presented by preschool classrooms provided by school districts and charter schools, which circumstances do not arise in classrooms for older children and youth, the department shall license public preschool providers only to protect the health and safety of children in public preschool classrooms. Notwithstanding any provision of this part 3 to the contrary, licensing for public preschool providers must focus only on those aspects of the preschool program and environment that affect children's health and safety and are not already actively regulated by other federal or state agencies or departments. The department shall align any requirements for the license related to qualifications or credentialing of program staff with the requirements for an early childhood endorsement for a license issued by the department of education pursuant to article 60.5 of title 22.

       The executive director shall promulgate rules for substitute placement agencies and substitute child care providers. At a minimum, the rules must require that the substitute child care provider demonstrate that the provider has the training and certification for the child care license type and position in which the substitute child care provider is placed. Pursuant to section 26.5-5-316 (1)(a)(I)(C), each substitute child care provider shall pay for and submit to a fingerprint-based criminal history record check and a review of the records and reports of child abuse or neglect maintained by the state department of human services to determine whether the substitute child care provider has been found to be responsible in a confirmed report of child abuse or neglect. When the results of a fingerprint-based criminal history record check or any other records check performed on a person pursuant to this subsection (2) reveal a record of arrest without a disposition, the department rules shall require that person to submit to a name-based judicial record check, as defined in section 22-2-119.3 (6)(d). The substitute placement agency shall not place a substitute child care provider who is convicted of any of the crimes specified in section 26.5-5-309 (4) or 26.5-5-317.

         The department shall require any child care facility seeking licensure pursuant to section 26.5-5-309 to comply with any applicable zoning and land use development regulations of the municipality, city and county, or county where the facility is situated. Failure to comply with applicable zoning and land use regulations constitutes grounds for the denial of a license to a facility.

         Notwithstanding subsection (1)(a) of this section to the contrary, the availability of safe, affordable, and licensed family child care homes is a matter of statewide concern. Therefore, permitting fragmented regulation among jurisdictions impedes and infringes upon the department's appropriate and consistent licensing and regulation of family child care homes throughout the state. Accordingly, local governing authorities shall treat family child care homes as residential property use in the application of local regulations, including zoning, land use development, fire and life safety, sanitation, and building codes. Local governing authorities shall not impose any additional regulations governing family child care homes that do not also apply to other residential properties, provided that the foregoing does not restrict an authority's ability to prohibit, on a case-by-case basis, the operation in immediately adjacent residences of two or more large family child care homes, as that term is defined by department rules that govern the operation of family child care homes, or to manage the flow of traffic and parking related to adjacent large family child care homes. Residential use of property for zoning purposes includes all forms of residential zoning and, specifically, although not exclusively, single-family residential zoning.

       26.5-5-320. Injunctive proceedings.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The department, in the name of the people of the state of Colorado, through the attorney general of the state, must apply for an injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any person from operating any facility without a license that is required to be licensed under this part 3. If the person does not have a valid license pursuant to this part 3, the person's license has been revoked pursuant to section 26.5-5-317, or the person does not meet the licensing exemption criteria set forth in section 26.5-5-304, yet provides child care, and has a pattern of providing such child care without a valid license as required by this part 3, and despite having received notification from the department that the person or facility is in violation of the law, then the person is providing unlicensed and illegal child care. At the time the department applies for an injunction, the department shall notify law enforcement of the injunction proceedings. If it is established that the defendant has been or is so operating the facility without a valid license, the court shall enter a decree enjoining the defendant from further operating the facility unless and until the person obtains a license to operate the facility. In case of violation of any injunction issued pursuant to this section, the court may summarily try and punish the offender for contempt of court. Such injunctive proceedings are in addition to and not in lieu of the penalty provided in section 26.5-5-321.

       The general assembly finds that changes in demographics and economic trends in Colorado have increased the need for high-quality and affordable child care. The general assembly also recognizes that the provision of child care in this state and in the nation is a rapidly growing industry subject to many changes. The general assembly further finds that there is a need for continuing comprehensive review of the rules and the licensing procedures governing child care centers and family child care homes that includes the adequate and full participation of parents, consumers, child care providers, and interested persons. The general assembly finds that such a review with the goal of identifying problems in the fragmentation and lack of uniformity of standards in the licensing process would benefit the state and result in improvements in the regulation of this industry that is so vital to the health and well-being of the state's children and citizens.

In conducting such periodic review, the department shall consult with parents and consumers of child care, child care providers, the department of public health and environment, the department of human services, experts in the child care field, and other interested parties throughout the state. The periodic review must include an examination of the rules applicable to child care centers and family child care homes, the process of licensing such facilities, uniformity of standards or lack thereof in the licensing process, statewide standardization of investigations and enforcement of licensing by the department, duplication and conflicts in rules, requirements, or procedures between the department and the department of public health and environment, and recommendations for streamlining and unifying the licensing process. The review must also include an examination of rules and procedures regarding the general physical and mental health of employees and owners. At the conclusion of each review, the department shall report its findings and conclusions and its recommendations for administrative changes and for legislation to the executive director of the department of early childhood and the executive director of the department of public health and environment.

       The executive director shall promulgate rules establishing standards for licensing that allow an early care and education program to be licensed pursuant to part 3 of article 5 of this title 26.5 for a period of time determined by the executive director, if a number, as specified in department rule, of aspiring early childhood educators in the program are pursuing a state-agency-approved early childhood credential and other quality, safety, and supervision conditions are met.

      <li id="t26.5a06s26.5-6-103ol12">
       The executive director shall promulgate rules that allow an early childhood educator to earn points toward an early childhood credential that meets child care licensing standards based on the candidate's prior experience and demonstrated competency. The licensing pathway must also include ways in which a candidate in a second career or changing careers can earn points or credits for prior experience and competencies that apply toward the qualifications for an early childhood educator credential. The standards and credential awarding process may use validated tools to award points for demonstrated competencies.

      <li id="t26.5a06s26.5-6-103ol13">
       The department and the department of education shall align, to the extent possible, the state's early childhood professional credential, department of education educator licensing, and child care program licensing to make the requirements as consistent and clear as possible to educators and providers. The alignment process must include examining strategies that support reciprocity for early childhood educator credentials or qualifications earned outside of Colorado.

       The department, the department of higher education, and the department of education shall develop resources to support local communities to increase concurrent enrollment opportunities for high school students or other nontraditional students to earn higher education credits and degrees that allow them to serve as early childhood educators and shall support career pathways for high school students earning college credits toward becoming early childhood educators, including concurrent enrollment, career and technical education, the ASCENT program, and other career pathways.
