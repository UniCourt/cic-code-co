       Colorado's apportionment of congressional representatives pursuant to the 2000 federal census increased from six representatives to seven representatives. In November 2002, Congressional elections were held in seven districts described in a redistricting plan created by the district court for the city and county of Denver and affirmed in Beauprez v. Avalos, 42 P.3d 642 (Colo. 2002). The districts, however, described in section 2-1-101 (1) were created in Senate Bill 03-352 for use in congressional elections to be held in November 2004 and thereafter. Senate Bill 03-352 was the subject of several court actions:

        <li id="t02a01-editorsnoteol11a">
         Keller v. Davidson was filed in the district court for the city and county of Denver and subsequently removed to federal district court. On January 23, 2004, the district court denied a motion to file amended counterclaims and stayed the proceedings pending a final ruling in Salazar v. Davidson, discussed below. The district court opinion appears at 299 F. Supp. 2d (D. Colo. 2004). On October 15, 2004, the district court dismissed the matter.
        </li>
        <li id="t02a01-editorsnoteol11b">
         Salazar v. Davidson, case number 03SA133, and the related case of Davidson v. Salazar, case number 03SA147, were original actions filed with the Colorado Supreme Court. The Colorado Supreme Court held Senate Bill 03-352 unconstitutional and ordered the secretary of state to conduct congressional elections according to the plan approved in Beauprez v. Avalos. People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P.2d 1221 (Colo. 2003). The United States Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari in Colorado General Assembly v. Salazar, 541 U.S. 1093 (2004).

       The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the state of Colorado shall be divided into districts pursuant to the official figures of the most recent decennial census of the United States. The general assembly further finds and declares that such figures are the most reliable data that the state has available and that the use of any other data or of any data adjustments may create a serious risk of inaccuracy and injustice in establishing congressional districts to represent the citizens of Colorado.

        <b>
         Each of the nonconstitutional factors that a court may consider must be interpreted in light of the foundational goal of congressional redistricting under the United States constitution: Fair and effective representation for all citizens.
        </b>
        The minimization of disruption of existing boundary lines is only one among many factors that the court must balance. The statute gives the trial court broad discretion in striking this balance, and the consideration of competitiveness is consistent with the ultimate goal of maximizing fair and effective representation. The trial court's adoption of the Moreno/South map reasonably balanced these many factors and is supported by the evidence, and therefore was not an abuse of discretion. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incorporation of several of Denver's southern suburbs into the first district was reasonable, both because they share a community of interest and because incorporating suburbs elsewhere would have required splitting municipal boundaries. Current communities of interest, including the I-70 corridor, Rocky Mountain national park, the beetle-kill forest infestation, and higher education and its associated health and high-tech industries, justify the court's adoption of the second district, while the community of interest for this district from 10 years ago, the cleanup of Rocky Flats, is no longer relevant. The third district minimizes disruption of the existing district lines, thus maintaining communities of interest that remain important today. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The addition of rural Douglas, Arapahoe, and Adams counties into the fourth district, in part to compensate for the transfer of Larimer county into the second district, is supported by those areas' community of interest in agriculture and drought, and it was appropriate for the court to look to the near future in identifying pending oil and gas development in these areas as a community of interest. The fifth district is largely unchanged other than the removal of Lake county, as necessitated by the requirement of population equality. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sixth district puts Aurora in a single district, unites the newer and fast-developing suburbs from northeast of Denver to southwest of Denver, and properly creates a competitive district. Similarly, the seventh district becomes more compact by including the older suburbs from north of Denver through Jefferson county, which share a community of interest in clean energy and replacing aging infrastructure. The seventh district also includes a significant Latino community of interest and properly creates a competitive district. Hall v. Moreno, 2012 CO 14, 270 P.3d 961.

       2-2-316. Legislative declaration - travel by members - during adjournment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Considering the greatly improved highways and airways of this state which permit greater mobility with less cost in money and time, considering the increasing length of legislative sessions, the increasing complexity and importance of the problems presented, and the benefits to be derived from frequent contact between legislator and constituents, and considering the desirability of preserving the concept of part-time citizen-legislators and, therefore, the need to allow them a reasonable opportunity to attend to their own personal, family, and business affairs even during sessions of the general assembly, it is hereby declared to be necessary, within the meaning of the state constitution and in the best interests of the general assembly and the state of Colorado, that members of the senate and house of representatives travel to their homes or other locations within their districts and back to the capitol during sessions of the general assembly when the house to which they belong is in adjournment for periods not exceeding seventy-two hours.

       Drawing boundaries of two senatorial districts so that one district encompasses the residences of two incumbent state senators while no state senator resides in the other, and setting the senatorial election for the first district for 1982 and for the other district for 1984, with the result that no senator will reside in the latter district until 1985, is a violation of constitutional guarantees of legislative representation.

        <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2002ol11d">
         The appropriate method to address small, remote, and rural school district funding, including whether a different weight should be applied in the school finance formula for the size factor for small, remote school districts and whether to redesign the distribution of rural school funding received pursuant to section 22-54-142;

         The general assembly finds and declares that dramatic differences in local property wealth and the ability of some school districts to obtain voter approval to collect property tax revenue in addition to that provided by total program mill levies has led to inequity in the amount of funding available to serve students in school districts throughout the state. To lessen this inequity, it is appropriate to identify one or more methods by which to support efforts by low-property wealth districts to support the needs of their students through mill levy overrides for operating purposes.

         Therefore, in addition to the issues specified in subsection (1) of this section, the interim committee shall design and recommend a program beginning in the 2022-23 budget year to support students by assisting low-property wealth school districts in obtaining voter approval for additional mill levies pursuant to section 22-54-108 by providing state matching money. In designing the program, the interim committee shall consider:

           Free and reduced-price lunch eligibility for the federal "Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act", 42 U.S.C. sec. 1751 et seq., is a measure by which school districts receive additional funding through the at-risk factor in the school finance formula;
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aII">
           While many states provide additional funding based on reduced-price lunch eligibility, in Colorado, at-risk funding has traditionally been allocated only for students who are eligible for free lunch;
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aIII">
           The federal "Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act", 42 U.S.C. sec. 1751 et seq., was designed as an anti-hunger program, not as a single proxy for capturing student need. Economic disadvantage is complex and is affected by many factors beyond income, including wealth, local cost of living, and fluctuating household expenses.
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aIV">
           In the long term, Colorado's reliance on free lunch eligibility as the singular poverty proxy for school finance purposes is inaccurate and unsustainable, and serves as a barrier to delivering essential resources to students who need them;
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aV">
           Free lunch eligibility is a binary measure by which a student is considered economically disadvantaged or not and fails to account for varying levels of poverty and the corresponding levels of need that exist among student populations;
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aVI">
           The recent changes to federal policy that allow all students to receive a free lunch without submitting an income eligibility form negatively impacted Colorado's at-risk pupil count in the 2020-21 school year and will continue to do so in the 2021-22 school year, which may result in another undercount and underestimation of resources needed to serve economically disadvantaged students;
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aVII">
           Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Colorado's decentralized method of collecting income eligibility data created barriers to reaching families who were eligible for pandemic electronic benefit transfer payments, resulting in fewer than half of the eligible children receiving the benefit;
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aVIII">
           Due to the continued use of the misaligned proxy for determining student need and the continued underestimation of economic disadvantage, Colorado students who would benefit the most from additional support are going without it; and
          </li>
          <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11aIX">
           State policy can more accurately account for and respond to students' economic circumstances. Other states have moved away from relying on one self-reported measure, such as free and reduced-price lunch eligibility, toward an index of measures of need that automatically qualify students for school meals or for additional funding through the school finance formula.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t02a02p20s2-2-2003ol11b">
         Therefore, the general assembly declares that studying methods to identify economic disadvantage among students precisely and holistically is an important and necessary goal in providing public schools with the resources necessary to enable all students to achieve academic success.

         The interim committee shall issue a request for proposals for qualified third-party vendors to complete the poverty study described in this section.

The committee consists of four senators, two from each major political party, to be appointed by the president and the minority leader of the senate, respectively, with the approval of a majority of the members elected to the senate and four representatives, two from each major political party, to be appointed by the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives, respectively, with the approval of a majority of the members elected to the house of representatives. Appointments to the committee shall be made no later than sixty days after the convening of the first regular session of the general assembly held in each odd-numbered year. An appointing authority may make an appointment to temporarily replace a current member of the committee appointed by that appointing authority; except that, a temporary appointment does not require approval of a majority of the members elected to the applicable body. Membership on the committee terminates with the appointment of a member's successor or upon the termination of a member's term of office in the general assembly, whichever occurs first, and any member may be appointed to succeed himself or herself on the committee. Vacancies in the committee's membership shall be filled in the same manner as original appointments; except that the approval of the members elected to the general assembly is not necessary if any such appointment is made when the general assembly is not in session.

           In the 2018-19 school year, statewide assessment data shows considerable achievement gaps as measured by assessment scores for Colorado students. The assessment scores on the statewide assessment in English language arts demonstrated that approximately forty-five percent of all Colorado students were performing at grade level, while approximately thirty percent of Latino or Black students and approximately twenty-eight percent of low-income students were performing at grade level. Similarly, the assessment scores on the statewide assessment in mathematics demonstrated that approximately thirty-five percent of all students were performing at grade level, while approximately eighteen percent of Latino or Black students and approximately eighteen percent of low-income students were performing at grade level.

           In 1965, congress passed the "Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965", 20 U.S.C. sec. 6301 et seq., to address persistent inequities for historically underserved students. Research shows that disparities in academic achievement are often caused by disparities in opportunities, such as the inequitable distribution of funding, preschool access, advanced course work, highly effective teachers, and wraparound services. Research also shows that Latino and Black students are more likely to have less-experienced and lower-paid teachers as a result of a gap in funding and more likely to be disciplined more harshly in school.

           Colorado adopted the statewide system of standards and assessments in 2008 and the statewide education accountability system in 2009 to comply with federal statewide testing requirements, gauge the success of public schools in educating students, and identify areas in which the state, the department of education, public schools, school districts, boards of cooperative services, and the state charter school institute could better support students, teachers, and families in meeting their children's educational needs;

           The requirements of the statewide system of standards and assessments and the statewide education accountability system currently exceed the federal testing requirements and have undergone several significant modifications over the past decade, causing policymakers to question whether the systems still align with the general assembly's original intent in adopting the systems;

           The general assembly desires to review the statewide system of standards and assessments and the statewide education accountability system to ensure that they do not contain institutional or cultural biases based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, nationality, disability, age, or economic status; and to ensure that the systems provide an accurate, credible, and comparable assessment of the delivery of public education throughout the state;

The director of the office of legislative legal services or the director's designees may conduct the poll by in-person, electronic, or digital communication with committee members. Approval of the question by a majority of the committee members in response to the poll has the same effect as if the question were approved by a majority vote of the committee members taken in a committee meeting. If the committee approves a question by poll, the committee shall post on the committee website a notice of vote to retain counsel that at a minimum specifies the name of the legal counsel to be retained, the legal matter for which the legal counsel will provide representation, and the committee, agency, or individual that the legal counsel will represent. The notice of vote to retain counsel shall be posted within three business days after the poll is completed.

         The general assembly finds and declares that advisory committees are beneficial to government since they help involve private citizens in the daily operations of government and provide the government with a system for using the expertise of its citizens. However, historically there was no legislative supervision that would allow for the systematic review of these committees to identify those committees that may have outlived their usefulness yet remained in the statutes and those committees that may have failed to perform the functions for which they were created. To assure that newly created advisory committees are supervised and subjected to review, the life of a newly created advisory committee may not exceed ten years, and the statutory authorization for the committee must include a corresponding repeal provision. The general assembly, acting by bill, may reschedule the review date for an advisory committee to a later date if the rescheduled date does not violate the ten-year maximum life provision. Newly created advisory committees are subject to the review provisions of this section.

        It is a well settled rule of statutory construction that all words and phrases used in a statute

       shall be understood and construed according to the approved and common usage of the language and that some meaning shall be given to every word used. Thomas v. City of Grand Junction, 13 Colo. App. 80, 56 P. 665 (1889); People v. J.J.H., 17 P.3d 159 (Colo. 2001).

        However, it is equally a well settled rule of construction

       that if no sensible meaning can be given to a word or phrase, or if it would defeat, manifestly, the real object of the enactment, it should be eliminated. Thomas v. City of Grand Junction, 13 Colo. App. 80, 56 P. 665 (1899).

        And to carry out the intention of the general assembly, another word may be read

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        These may be said to be the exceptions to the general rule

        When a statutory term may be used in different senses,
       </b>
       it is permissible for the court to apply the definition which will "best effectuate the legislative intent in the enactment of the law". Clown's Den, Inc. v. Canjar, 33 Colo. App. 212, 518 P.2d 957 (1974).

        Prior judicial construction of language used in subsequent legislation.

       It is to be presumed that a general assembly is cognizant of and adopts the construction which prior judicial decisions have placed on particular language when such language is employed in subsequent legislation. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo. 194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Also, the use of two different words or phrases, each of which expresses the same common meaning,
       </b>
       does not render a statute internally inconsistent. Howe v. People, 178 Colo. 248, 496 P.2d 1040 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>

      <p>
       <b>
        The word "may"
       </b>
       when used in a statute to denote choice of procedure not affecting it or any party of interest is not mandatory, but generally construed to mean "must" where a substantial interest is affected. Duprey v. Anderson, 184 Colo. 70, 518 P.2d 807 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where persons or the public have an interest in having an act done by a public body, the word "may" in a statute means "must". Duprey v. Anderson, 184 Colo. 70, 518 P.2d 807 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In the absence of any emergency clause, the expression "after the passage of the act",
       </b>
       as used in the law, can have but one meaning, namely after the act goes into effect. Harding v. People, 10 Colo. 387, 15 P. 727 (1887).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Also parent is a common word,
       </b>
       and the court in construing a contract, will give it its common meaning. Mund v. Rehaume, 51 Colo. 129, 117 P. 159, 1913A Ann. Cas. 1243 (1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Finally the word "employment" as used should be construed according to its ordinary meaning.

       when used in interpreting unemployment compensation statute, was to be given its ordinary meaning. Weld County Kirby Co. v. Indus. Comm'n, 676 P.2d 1253 (Colo. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The term "includes",
       </b>
       as it is commonly understood, operates to extend rather than limit. Lyman v. Town of Bow Mar, 188 Colo. 216, 533 P.2d 1129 (1975); People v. Pipkin, 762 P.2d 736 (Colo. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When giving statutory language its plain and obvious meaning creates an absurd result,
       </b>
       the intention of the framers will prevail over such interpretation. People v. Bowman, 812 P.2d 725 (Colo. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There is a presumption that the word "shall",
       </b>
       when used in a statute, is mandatory. Williams Natural Gas Co. v. Mesa Operating Limited P'ship, 778 P.2d 309 (Colo. App. 1989); Pearson v. District Court, 18th Jud. Dist., 924 P.2d 512 (Colo. 1996).

      <p>
       <b>
        Statutory reference to the popular name of a federal act encompassed all benefits payable under that act.

       2-4-204. Severability of statutory provisions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If any provision of a statute is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions of the statute are valid, unless it appears to the court that the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so dependent upon, the void provision that it cannot be presumed the legislature would have enacted the valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court determines that the valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.

Although § 29-1-304.5 (1) was adopted after § 1-5-505 (1), there is no manifest intent that it should prevail in a conflict with the other statute. Rather, the intent of the legislature was to prioritize citizens' access to free and fair elections over convenience or cost savings to counties. Thus, § 1-5-505 (1) should prevail over § 29-1-304.5 (1), notwithstanding that this increase in service may create additional costs to the county. Gessler v. Doty, 2012 COA 4, 272 P.3d 1131.

       <b>
        The program of revision and publication of statutes is based upon laws that exist as enacted by the general assembly

       and as construed and defined by the courts. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148 Colo. 429, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But any law or statute which is reenacted, amended or revised,
       </b>
       so far as it is the same as that of a prior law, shall be construed as a continuation of such law and not as a new enactment or provision. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148 Colo. 429, 366 P.2d 384 (1961); Estes Park Bank v. Shanks, 794 P.2d 1108 (Colo. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And so far as it is the same in substantial intent, effect and meaning,
       </b>
       it shall be given effect as though continuation of such law. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148 Colo. 429, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Also where a statute is reenacted in the substantial form of a preexisting statute without change of legal effect,
       </b>
       it is effective or not effective as of its original and preexisting status. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148 Colo. 429, 366 P.2d 384 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When a statute is amended, it is presumed that the legislature intended to change the law.
       </b>
       Robles v. People, 811 P.2d 804 (Colo. 1991); Douglas County Bd. of Eq. v. Fidelity Castle Pines, 890 P.2d 119 (Colo. 1995); Powell v. City of Colo. Springs, 131 P.3d 1129 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 156 P.3d 461 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       This presumption is rebuttable, but, in a criminal case controlled by an earlier version of statute that was not ambiguous, there was no room for interpretation; prior statute would be applied according to its terms regardless of subsequent amendment that assertedly "clarified any ambiguity" but was found to change meaning of statute. Robles v. People, 811 P.2d 804 (Colo. 1991); Douglas County Bd. of Eq. v. Fidelity Castle Pines, 890 P.2d 119 (Colo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       This presumption may be rebutted only by a showing that the general assembly intended to clarify an existing ambiguity in that law. Thus, if an amendment clarifies such an ambiguity, the law remains unchanged by the amendment, and it may provide convincing evidence of the general assembly's intent to apply the amendment retroactively. Powell v. City of Colo. Springs, 131 P.3d 1129 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 156 P.3d 461 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine whether an amendment clarifies or changes a statute, the court must examine the plain language used by the general assembly, the legislative history surrounding the amendment, and any ambiguity in the provision before it was amended. Powell v. City of Colo. Springs, 131 P.3d 1129 (Colo. App. 2005), aff'd, 156 P.3d 461 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment of a statute creates a rebuttable presumption that a change in the law was intended. When more specific sections, however, are added to a general statutory provision, the addition may indicate a legislative intent to clarify the existing statute or to resolve an ambiguity in the former law. Colo. Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Bethesda Care Ctr., Inc., 867 P.2d 4 (Colo. App. 1993); People ex rel. T.T., 128 P.3d 328 (Colo. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And where such a reenacted statute has been construed,
       </b>
       the force and effect of such construction remains an integral part of the reenacted statute. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148 Colo. 429, 366 P.2d 384 (1961); Rauschenberger v. Radetsky, 745 P.2d 640 (Colo. 1987); Messler v. Phillips, 867 P.2d 128 (Colo. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And where statutes are reenacted the construction previously placed upon them is deemed to have been approved by the general assembly
       </b>
       in making the enactments and with the understanding the former construction will be adhered to. Creacy v. Indus. Comm'n, 148 Colo. 429, 366 P.2d 384 (1961); Rauschenberger v. Radetsky, 745 P.2d 640 (Colo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because contemporaneous construction of legislation, acquiesced in for many years by the authorities charged with its enforcement,
       </b>
       is entitled to great weight in determining the intent of the framers. Sec. Life &amp; Accident Co. v. Heckers, 177 Colo. 455, 495 P.2d 225 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the absence of clear error, such a long established construction should not be overturned or disregarded. Sec. Life &amp; Accident Co. v. Heckers, 177 Colo. 455, 495 P.2d 225 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Therefore, when the general assembly repeatedly reenacts a statute which has theretofore received a settled judicial construction, there can be no doubt as to the legislative intent.

      </p>
      <p>

        And while this statute does adopt certain portions of the common law of England and states that it shall be the law of this state,

      </p>
      <p>
       In order to recognize an abrogation of the common-law remedy for tortious bad faith breach of an insurance contract, there must be a clear legislative intent to do so. Farmers Group, Inc. v. Williams, 805 P.2d 419 (Colo. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The principle of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of the common law
       </b>
       must be narrowly construed is a principle applicable only when an ambiguity in the language of the statute in question permits such narrowing construction and when the intent of the legislature is not to the contrary; that principle cannot be invoked to defeat the plain and manifest language of the Industrial Relations Act. Martin v. Montezuma-Cortez Sch. Dist. RE-1, 841 P.2d 237 (Colo. 1992).

      <p>
       <b>
        The general assembly possesses the authority to abrogate the common law remedies;

        And it is true, that where the constitution, code, and statute controlling the proceeding are silent

       as to the mode of trial, it will be in accord with the usage and practice prevailing before the adoption of the constitution, code, or statute. Clough v. Clough, 10 Colo. App. 433, 51 P. 513 (1897), aff'd, 27 Colo. 97, 59 P. 736 (1899); Huston v. Wadsworth, 5 Colo. 213 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        But in case there is no previous usage or practice, the proceedings including the mode of trial would come within the provisions of the statute

       declaring that the common law of England, so far as applicable, shall be the rule of decision, and be considered as of full force. Clough v. Clough, 10 Colo. App. 433, 51 P. 513 (1897), aff'd, 27 Colo. 97, 59 P. 736 (1899); Huston v. Wadsworth, 5 Colo. 213 (1880).

        And where the law of another state becomes material and there has been no evidence offered concerning it,

        </b>
       </h5>

         The appropriate construction of a statute is a question of law.
        </b>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The necessities of modern legislation dealing with complex economic and social problems have led to judicial approval of broad standards for administrative action,
        </b>
        especially in regulatory enactments under the police power, and with respect to such types of legislation, detailed standards in precise and unvarying form would be unrealistic and more arbitrary than a general indefinite standard. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of America, Inc., 177 Colo. 97, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And a statute should be given construction which will render it effective in accomplishing purpose
        </b>
        for which it was enacted. In re Questions Submitted by United States Dist. Court, 179 Colo. 270, 499 P.2d 1169 (1972); Zaba v. Motor Vehicle Div., 183 Colo. 335, 516 P.2d 634 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute should be construed to accomplish the purpose for which it is enacted. Firstbank of N. Longmont v. Banking Bd., 648 P.2d 684 (Colo. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Whether constitution or statute is involved, that interpretation which, brushing aside minor objections and trivial technicalities,
        </b>
        effectuates the intent of the act, is a broad interpretation, and that which, regarding such objections and technicalities, fails to do so, is narrow. In re Senate Resolution No. 2, 94 Colo. 101, 31 P.2d 325 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         In construing either constitutional or statutory language the first requisite is to inquire what objective was sought
        </b>
        to be accomplished by it. In re Questions Submitted by United States Dist. Court, 179 Colo. 270, 499 P.2d 1169 (1972).

        <b>
         Court to discern legislative intent.
        </b>
        In construing a statute, the court's task is to discern the intent of the general assembly. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Smith, 658 P.2d 255 (Colo. 1983); People v. District Court, 713 P.2d 918 (Colo. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary goal of statutory construction is to effect the intent of the general assembly. Water Quality Control Div. v. Casias, 843 P.2d 665 (Colo. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         To do this the court should strive to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the general assembly.
        </b>
        A statute imperfect in its details is not void unless impossible of execution. The title of an act may be looked to in seeking the legislative intent, and the preamble as well. W. Lumber &amp; Pole Co. v. City of Golden, 23 Colo. App. 461, 130 P. 1027 (1913); Dekelt v. People, 44 Colo. 525, 99 P. 330 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that the legislative intent should be ascertained and given effect whenever possible. People v. Stevens, 183 Colo. 399, 517 P.2d 1336 (1973); People v. Sneed, 183 Colo. 96, 514 P.2d 776 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        No court should interpret a statute in such a manner as to frustrate the intent of the general assembly. Frohlick Crane Serv., Inc. v. Mack, 182 Colo. 34, 510 P.2d 891 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The court may not infer the intent of the general assembly by review of a subsequent amendment to the statute, however.
        </b>
        People v. Duncan, 109 P.3d 1044 (Colo. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Contemporaneous statements of individual legislators
        </b>
        are relevant to judicial inquiry into legislative intent. Archer Daniels Midland Co. v. State, 690 P.2d 177 (Colo. 1984); In re Estate of Hill, 713 P.2d 928 (Colo. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Because in statutory construction, legislative intent is polestar.

        People v. Lee, 180 Colo. 376, 506 P.2d 136 (1973); Firstbank of N. Longmont v. Banking Bd., 648 P.2d 684 (Colo. App. 1982); In re Estate of Hill, 713 P.2d 928 (Colo. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Also statutes must be construed to carry out their beneficent purposes,
        </b>
        and not to defeat them. Eugene Cervi &amp; Co. v. Russell, 31 Colo. App. 525, 506 P.2d 748 (1972), aff'd, 184 Colo. 282, 519 P.2d 1189 (1974); Seibel v. Colo. Real Estate Comm'n, 34 Colo. App. 415, 530 P.2d 1290 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And, statute should be construed as whole so as to give consistent,
        </b>
        harmonious, and sensible effect to all its parts. Massey v. District Court, 180 Colo. 359, 506 P.2d 128 (1973); Seibel v. Colo. Real Estate Comm'n, 34 Colo. App. 415, 530 P.2d 1290 (1974); People v. District Court, 713 P.2d 918 (Colo. 1986); In re Davisson, 797 P.2d 809 (Colo. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In ascertaining the intent of a legislative body, and the meaning of its enactments, courts are required to give effect to every work, phrase, clause, sentence, and section, if it can be done. Blue River Defense Comm. v. Town of Silverthorne, 33 Colo. App. 10, 516 P.2d 452 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words and phrases of a statute should be given effect according to their plain and ordinary meaning. In re Davisson, 797 P.2d 809 (Colo. App. 1990); Gabriel v. City &amp; County of Denver, 824 P.2d 36 (Colo. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Therefore, courts should not extend an enactment by construction beyond the expression of the act.
        </b>
        Kellogg v. Hickman, 12 Colo. 256, 21 P. 325 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Moreover,
        </b>
        statute will not be construed in such way as to defeat legislative intent. Kellogg v. Hickman, 12 Colo. 256, 21 P. 325 (1888); People v. Lee, 180 Colo. 376, 506 P.2d 136 (1973); Frohlick Crane Serv., Inc. v. Mack, 182 Colo. 34, 510 P.2d 891 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Although the construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to deference,
        </b>
        courts are not bound by an agency construction that misapplies or misconstrues the law. Golden Aluminum v. Weld County Comm'rs, 867 P.2d 190 (Colo. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         But courts and administrative agencies are not at liberty to substitute their own notions of public policy
        </b>
        for public policy of state as declared by general assembly. Fleming v. State Civil Serv. Comm'n, 31 Colo. App. 463, 506 P.2d 158 (1972), rev'd on other grounds, 183 Colo. 71, 514 P.2d 1135 (1973).

       <p>
        <b>
         Read and consider in context.
        </b>
        In construing a section of a legislative act, it is fundamental that the whole of the act must be read and considered in context. Humana, Inc. v. Bd. of Adjustment, 189 Colo. 79, 537 P.2d 741 (1975); People v. District Court, 713 P.2d 918 (Colo. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Courts are not to presume that legislative body used language in statute idly and with no intent
        </b>
        that meaning should be given to its language. Blue River Defense Comm. v. Town of Silverthorne, 33 Colo. App. 10, 516 P.2d 452 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Prior judicial construction of language presumed adopted in subsequent legislation.
        </b>
        It is to be presumed that a general assembly is cognizant of and adopts the construction which prior judicial decisions have placed on particular language when such language is employed in subsequent legislation. Thompson v. People, 181 Colo. 194, 510 P.2d 311 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Construction that converts statute into absurdity is a construction forbidden

       2-4-216. Limitations on statutory programs.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t02a04p02s2-4-216ol11">
       When the general assembly creates statutory programs which are not required by federal law and which offer and provide services or assistance or both to persons in this state, the general assembly gives rise to a reasonable expectation that such services or assistance or both will be provided by the state in a manner consistent with the statutes which created the programs. However, the general assembly does not commit itself or the taxpayers of the state to the provision of a particular level of funding for such programs and does not create rights in the ultimate recipient to a particular level of service or assistance or both. The general assembly intends that the level of funding, and thus the level of service or assistance or both, shall be in the full and complete discretion of the general assembly, consistent with the statute which created the program.
      </li>
      <li id="t02a04p02s2-4-216ol12">
       In the statutes creating some of these programs, the general assembly expressly conditions any rights arising under such programs by the use of the words "within available appropriations" or "subject to available appropriations" or similar words of limitation. The purpose of the use of these words of limitation is to reaffirm the principles set forth in subsection (1) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t02a04p02s2-4-216ol13">
       At the time such a program is created, the general assembly appropriates funds for its implementation, taking into account many factors, including but not limited to the availability of revenues, the importance of the program, and needs of recipients when balanced with the needs of recipients under other state programs. The amount of the initial appropriation indicates a program's priority in relation to other state programs. The general assembly reasonably expects that the priority of the program will be subject to annual changes which will be reflected in the modification of the annual appropriation for the program. If the general assembly desires a substantive change in the program, or to eliminate the program, that can be accomplished by amendment of the statutory law which created the program.
      </li>
      <li id="t02a04p02s2-4-216ol14">
       It is the purpose of the general assembly, through the enactment of this section, to clarify that the rights, if any, created through the enactment of statutory programs are subject to substantial modification through the annual appropriation process, so long as the modification is consistent with the statute which created the program.

        Absent an express legislative provision, the repeal of a statute will not operate retroactively to modify vested rights or liabilities. Stark v. Zimmerman, 638 P.2d 843 (Colo. App. 1981).

       <p>
        <b>
         And so long as there is a general law limiting the effect of the repeal,
        </b>
        it is declarative of the general policy of the state and takes effect unless the repealing act, or expiration clause, expressly provides otherwise. State v. McMillin, 150 Colo. 23, 370 P.2d 435 (1962); Wall v. Crawford, 103 Colo. 66, 82 P.2d 749 (1938).

        <b>
         To hold otherwise would do violence to the expressed and plain intent of the general assembly

        that the reservation as to pending prosecutions applies equally to matters arising before repeal, even though prosecution not be had until after such repeal. Martinez v. People, 174 Colo. 365, 484 P.2d 792 (1971).
       </p>

         And the provision for retention of penalties does not attempt to interfere in any manner with future legislation.

       <p>
        <b>
         But the repeal of a statute prescribing a penalty
        </b>
        shall not prevent a recovery of such penalty unless the repealing statute so provides. Cavanaugh v. Patterson, 41 Colo. 158, 91 P. 1117 (1907); Wilson v. People, 36 Colo. 418, 85 P. 187 (1906).

        <b>
         And hence, by virtue of its provisions, the repeal of a statute imposing penalties under certain conditions,
        </b>
        without any saving clause, does not prevent the recovery of such penalties when it appears that the repeal and subsequent statute are not inconsistent with its purpose. Wilson v. People, 36 Colo. 418, 85 P. 187 (1906); Cavanaugh v. Patterson, 41 Colo. 158, 91 P. 1117 (1907).

         However, the general saving character is limited to those acts which relate to a penalty, forfeiture or liability,

        <b>
         The penalty, forfeiture or liability which is saved, is one not merely incurred

        <b>
         But the retention of penalties provision does not apply where a statute gives certain rights of action upon grounds of public policy,

        no vested rights as to the continuance thereof are conferred, and notwithstanding the existence of a general saving statute such as this section, the repeal of the provision takes away all its benefits as regards incomplete actions existing at the time of the repeal, whether they be pending in appellate or trial courts.

         III. SECTION PART OF REPEALED OR AMENDED STATUTE.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         The court has a right to assume that the general assembly, in passing a repealing statute without a savings clause,
        </b>
        had in view the terms, scope, and legal effect of this section evidently passed to provide for such contingencies. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24 Colo. 418, 51 P. 165 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The retention of penalties provision is in general terms
        </b>
        and it aims at no specific statute. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24 Colo. 418, 51 P. 165 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And is intended to embrace all statutes, both civil and criminal.

        Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24 Colo. 418, 51 P. 165 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Since the retention of penalties provision is broad in its scope, ample in its terms,
        </b>
        therefore without giving undue force to its language, and without the adoption of a strained construction, it may be taken to be a part and parcel of a repealing or amending statute. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24 Colo. 418, 51 P. 165 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And if this is so, then a statute is amended and reenacted with this provision attached,
        </b>
        and the court must read that section being repealed or amended as though it contained a provision that it should not be taken to extend to or affect any suits or proceedings already begun. Day v. Madden, 9 Colo. App. 464, 48 P. 1053, appeal dismissed, 24 Colo. 418, 51 P. 165 (1897).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate in an act which will soon expire under its own terms a specific exemption

        from the retention of penalties provision to avoid its application. State v. McMillan, 150 Colo. 23, 370 P.2d 435 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>

       <p>
        <b>

     <ol>
      <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol11">
       Colorado Revised Statutes 1973 was enacted as a repeal and reenactment of Colorado Revised Statutes 1963 and the supplements thereto, as provided for in section 2-5-122, as said section existed upon its repeal.
      </li>
      <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol12">
       The effect of the enactment of the Colorado Revised Statutes 1973, as of its effective and operative date, shall be:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol12a">
         To repeal all statutes and parts of statutes of a general and permanent nature not contained in the Colorado Revised Statutes 1973;

        </li>
        <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol12d">
         Neither to abate nor otherwise affect any action, suit, or proceeding pending on such effective and operative date;
        </li>
        <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol12e">
         To affect no penalty or forfeiture incurred before such effective and operative date, except that where a punishment, penalty, or forfeiture is mitigated by any provision of the Colorado Revised Statutes 1973, that mitigating provision shall apply to any judgment pronounced after that effective and operative date; and
        </li>
        <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol12f">
         To have no effect on the running or ending of a limitation or period of time prescribed for acquiring a right, barring a remedy, or for any other purpose, where the time limitation began to run before that effective and operative date and the same or a similar limitation is prescribed in Colorado Revised Statutes 1973.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol13">
       The provisions of Colorado Revised Statutes 1973, insofar as they are the same in substantial intent, effect, and meaning as those of prior laws, shall be given effect as though a continuation of those laws and not as new enactments. If, however, any act set out in the prior laws and reenacted by Colorado Revised Statutes 1973 or any supplement thereto is alleged to have had a defective title when originally enacted, that defect is cured by enactment of the Colorado Revised Statutes 1973 or any supplement thereto.
      </li>
      <li id="t02a05s2-5-113ol14">
       The classification and arrangement by title, article, and numbering system of sections of Colorado Revised Statutes, as well as the section headings, source notes, annotations, revisor's notes, and other editorial material, shall be construed to form no part of the legislative text but to be only for the purpose of convenience, orderly arrangement, and information; therefore, no implication or presumption of a legislative construction is to be drawn therefrom.
