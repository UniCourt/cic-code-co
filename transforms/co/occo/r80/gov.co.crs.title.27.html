        The article was repealed and reenacted in 1973 with an effective date of July 1, 1974. (See L. 73, p. 819.) Section 3 of chapter 67, Session Laws of Colorado 1974, changed the effective date of the repeal and reenactment from July 1, 1974, to July 1, 1975. (See L. 74, p. 287.) In compiling C.R.S. 1973, which was not available until 1974, two versions were printed. Article 1 of chapter 71, C.R.S. 1963, was reorganized and renumbered as article 9 of title 27 in the compilation of C.R.S. 1973 and contained the original version of article 1 of chapter 71 found in C.R.S. 1963 in effect until July 1, 1975. The repealed and reenacted version of article 1 of chapter 71, C.R.S. 1963, effective July 1, 1975, was renumbered as article 10 in the compilation of C.R.S. 1973 and replaced article 9. (For the version of article 1 of chapter 71 in effect until July 1, 1975, see article 9 of title 27 in the original volume of C.R.S. 1973, pages 381 through 398.)

       Subsection (7)(b) clearly requires that the "school district shall provide to the community incorporated board" a sum of money determined by a stated formula; therefore, the clear right of a school board to demand performance, and the clear legal duty on a school district to act, makes this a proper case for disposition by mandamus.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds that state and local agencies provide a variety of services and supports to persons with developmental disabilities including institutional care, residential, social, and income maintenance services, diagnostic and health-related services, and educational and other programs. Because these services and supports are supported by many diverse agencies and organizations and because congress, through the federal "Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Act", and amendments thereto, has called for the establishment of state councils to provide coordination and planning in the field of developmental disabilities, the general assembly declares that there is need to establish a state council on developmental disabilities to be responsible for the coordination of services and supports to the persons with developmental disabilities and to serve as an advocate for such persons. The general assembly further finds that there is need to carefully define the duties and responsibilities of a state council on developmental disabilities.

          <li id="t27a60p01s27-60-101ol11aI">
           There are people in Colorado communities who are experiencing behavioral health crises and need professional behavioral health crisis care or urgent psychiatric care from skilled mental health clinicians and medical professionals who excel at providing compassionate behavioral health crisis intervention and stabilization;

          <li id="t27a60p01s27-60-101ol11aIII">
           Persons in a behavioral health crisis frequently come in contact with community first responders who are often unable to provide necessary behavioral health interventions or who must transport these persons in a behavioral health crisis to emergency rooms for services, or, in cases where a crime is alleged, to jail;

          <li id="t27a60p01s27-60-101ol11aV">
           Fewer than one-half of the persons who are in a behavioral health crisis and are taken to an emergency room are admitted for inpatient hospitalization, meaning that thousands of people each year return to community streets with little, if any, crisis intervention or treatment for behavioral health disorders; and

          <li id="t27a60p01s27-60-101ol11aVI">
           Significant time and resources are required of community first responders in addressing persons in a behavioral health crisis and, in many cases, this community response is neither timely nor safe for the person in crisis nor cost-efficient for the state.

         Colorado's statutory scheme does not designate an entity responsible for competency restoration services, nor does it provide a sufficient framework for the provision of outpatient restoration services to adults or juveniles. As a result, there have been deficits and inconsistencies in the administration of the educational component of outpatient competency restoration services and the coordination and integration of that component with existing services and supports to address the underlying causes of incompetency.

        <li id="t27a60p02s27-60-201ol11a">
         On April 8, 2019, the Colorado behavioral health task force was created, bringing together individuals representing diverse and balanced perspectives with respect to issues such as adults, children, and families who are dealing with mental health or substance use issues, key executive agencies representing state, local, and tribal governments, criminal justice experts, advocacy groups, behavioral health experts, and consumers;

         The behavioral health task force focused on creating a behavioral health system that includes equitable access to whole-person care;

        <li id="t27a60p02s27-60-201ol11d">
         In September 2020, the behavioral health task force released its blueprint, subcommittee, and COVID-19 special committee reports that outline its vision for behavioral health reform; and

        <li id="t27a60p02s27-60-201ol11e">
         The findings and recommendations of the task force indicate that it is imperative that an improved behavioral health system in Colorado:

      </li>
      <li id="t27a60p02s27-60-201ol12">
       The general assembly further finds that in implementing the findings and recommendations of the Colorado behavioral health task force it is imperative to rely on all stakeholders working together to hold the behavioral health system accountable to ensure all Coloradans are receiving the care needed to fulfill the task force's aim of ensuring a quality behavioral health system.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a60p02s27-60-201ol13">
       Therefore, the general assembly declares that, to ensure a standard of high-quality, integrated, and consumer-centric access to behavioral health-care services, it is imperative that the recommendations and findings included in the blueprint created by the Colorado behavioral health task force be followed and that a single state agency, known as the behavioral health administration, be established to lead and promote the state's behavioral health priorities. It is imperative that the behavioral health administration transform the state's current behavioral health system by:

       The general assembly finds and declares that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t27a64s27-64-101ol11a">
         On July 16, 2020, the federal communications commission adopted rules, and on October 17, 2020, congress passed the "National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020", designating 988 as the three-digit number for the national suicide prevention lifeline to aid rapid access to suicide prevention and mental health support services;
        </li>
        <li id="t27a64s27-64-101ol11b">
         It is imperative for Colorado to implement 988 as the three-digit number for crisis response services in Colorado in order to comply with federal regulations; improve quality and access to behavioral health crisis services, especially for underserved populations and in rural areas of the state; and reduce stigma surrounding suicide, mental health, and substance use conditions;
        </li>
        <li id="t27a64s27-64-101ol11c">
         The 988 crisis hotline enterprise provides valuable benefits and services to telephone service users when the enterprise funds the 988 crisis hotline and provides crisis outreach, stabilization, and acute care to individuals calling the 988 crisis hotline from any jurisdiction in Colorado twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week;
        </li>
        <li id="t27a64s27-64-101ol11d">
         By providing the benefits and services specified in subsection (1)(c) of this section, the 988 crisis hotline enterprise engages in an activity conducted in the pursuit of a benefit, gain, or livelihood, and therefore operates as a business;
        </li>
        <li id="t27a64s27-64-101ol11e">
         Consistent with the determination of the Colorado supreme court in Nicholl v. E-470 Public Highway Authority, 896 P.2d 859 (Colo. 1995), that the power to impose taxes is inconsistent with enterprise status under section 20 of article X of the state constitution, it is the conclusion of the general assembly that the charges imposed by the enterprise is a fee, not a tax, because the charges are imposed for the specific purpose of allowing the enterprise to defray the costs of providing the benefits and services specified in subsection (1)(c) of this section to telephone service users and the charges are imposed at rates that are reasonably calculated based on the cost of the services received by telephone service users;
        </li>
        <li id="t27a64s27-64-101ol11f">
         So long as the 988 crisis hotline enterprise qualifies as an enterprise for purposes of section 20 of article X of the state constitution, the revenue from the charges imposed by the enterprise are not state fiscal year spending, as defined in section 24-77-102 (17), or state revenues, as defined in section 24-77-103.6 (6)(c), and do not count against either the state fiscal year spending limit imposed by section 20 article X of the state constitution or the excess state revenues cap, as defined in section 24-77-103.6 (6)(b)(I); and
        </li>
        <li id="t27a64s27-64-101ol11g">
         No other enterprise created simultaneously or within the preceding five years serves primarily the same purpose as the 988 crisis hotline enterprise and the 988 crisis hotline enterprise will generate revenue from charges of less than one hundred million dollars total in its first five fiscal years. Accordingly, the creation of the 988 crisis hotline enterprise does not require voter approval pursuant to section 24-77-108.

         The statutory scheme for the care and treatment of mentally ill persons
        </b>
        is calculated (1) to provide care and treatment adequately suited to the needs of patients in a dignified and least restrictive manner and (2) to ensure against premature release of patients when that release would pose a likely risk of serious bodily harm to the patient or others as a result of the patient's mental condition.

         Duty of a therapist to protect third persons

        The therapist-patient relationship is one which under certain circumstances will give rise to a duty on the part of the therapist to protect third persons from harm. Brady v. Hopper, 570 F. Supp. 1333 (D. Colo. 1983) (decided prior to enactment of ยง 13-21-117).

         Less restrictive alternatives need not be considered as a condition precedent to certification.

        Civil commitment constitutes a severe infringement of liberty requiring due process protection. However, the statutory scheme set forth in this article contains a number of procedural safeguards that greatly reduce the inherent risk of erroneous deprivation. Therefore, due process does not require a mandatory hearing at the time of certification since the statute provides for a hearing on request. People v. Stevens, 761 P.2d 768 (Colo. 1988).

Subject to section 15-14-316 (4), a ward, as defined in section 15-14-102 (15), may be admitted to a hospital or institutional care and treatment for a mental health disorder with the guardian's consent for as long as the ward agrees to such care and treatment.

       <li id="t27a65s27-65-104ol11">
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a minor who is fifteen years of age or older, whether with or without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, may consent to receive mental health services to be rendered by a facility, a professional person, or mental health professional licensed pursuant to part 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8 of article 245 of title 12 in any practice setting. Such consent is not subject to disaffirmance because of minority. The professional person or licensed mental health professional rendering mental health services to a minor may, with or without the consent of the minor, advise the minor's parent or legal guardian of the services given or needed.
       </li>
       <li id="t27a65s27-65-104ol12">
        A minor who is fifteen years of age or older or a minor's parent or legal guardian, on the minor's behalf, may make a voluntary application for hospitalization. An application for hospitalization on behalf of a minor who is under fifteen years of age and who is a ward of the department must not be made unless a guardian ad litem has been appointed for the minor or a petition for the same has been filed with the court by the agency having custody of the minor; except that such an application for hospitalization may be made under emergency circumstances requiring immediate hospitalization, in which case the agency shall file a petition for appointment of a guardian ad litem within seventy-two hours after application for admission is made, and the court shall immediately appoint a guardian ad litem. Procedures for hospitalization of a minor may proceed pursuant to this section once a petition for appointment of a guardian ad litem has been filed, if necessary. Whenever an application for hospitalization is made, an independent professional person shall interview the minor and conduct a careful investigation into the minor's background, using all available sources, including, but not limited to, the minor's parents or legal guardian, the minor's school, and any other social service agencies. Prior to admitting a minor for hospitalization, the independent professional person shall make the following findings:
        <ol type="a">
         <li id="t27a65s27-65-104ol12a">
          That the minor has a mental health disorder and is in need of hospitalization;

        An interview and investigation by an independent professional person is not required for a minor who is fifteen years of age or older and who, upon the recommendation of the minor's treating professional person, seeks voluntary hospitalization with the consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian. In order to assure that the minor's consent to such hospitalization is voluntary, the minor shall be advised, at or before the time of admission, of the minor's right to refuse to sign the admission consent form and the minor's right to revoke the minor's consent at a later date. If a minor admitted pursuant to this subsection (3) subsequently revokes the minor's consent after admission, a review of the minor's need for hospitalization pursuant to subsection (4) of this section must be initiated immediately.

         <li id="t27a65s27-65-104ol14d">
          Ten days prior to the review, the patient representative at the mental health facility shall notify the minor of the date of the review and shall assist the minor in articulating to the independent professional person the minor's wishes concerning continued hospitalization.

The minor shall be informed of the results of the review within three days after the review's completion.

The minor; the minor's attorney, if any; and the minor's parent, legal guardian, or guardian ad litem, if any, shall be given written notice that a hearing upon the recommendation for continued hospitalization may be had before the court or a jury upon written request directed to the court pursuant to subsection (6)(d) of this section.

         Patient's common-law right to decline medical treatment
        </b>
        is among those protected by this section and is preserved intact in the absence of some finding that the patient's illness has so impaired his judgment that he is incapable of participating in decisions affecting his health. Goedecke v. State Dept. of Insts., 198 Colo. 407, 603 P.2d 123 (1979).

        <b>
         Right of incompetent to decline treatment.
        </b>
        The right to decline medical treatment is not lost to a patient who is mentally incapable of deciding that question for himself. People in Interest of Medina, 662 P.2d 184 (Colo. App. 1982), aff'd, 705 P.2d 961 (Colo. 1985).

        <b>
         When nonconsensual treatment may be ordered.
        </b>
        Treatment with antipsychotic medication should not be ordered unless: (1) The patient is incompetent to effectively participate in the treatment decision; (2) such treatment is necessary to prevent long-term deterioration in the patient's mental condition; (3) a less intrusive treatment is not available; and (4) the patient's need for such treatment overrides any legitimate interest of the patient in refusing treatment. In any event, and the order for involuntary medication cannot exceed six months without further extension. People v. Medina, 705 P.2d 961 (Colo. 1985).

        <b>
         Medina test for forcibly administering medication applies equally to a forcible increase in medication dosage.
        </b>
        The second Medina element requires a patient to be deteriorating, which does not mean the same thing as "not improving". A patient who is simply not improving will not satisfy the Medina test for forcible administration of medication. People v. Marquardt, 2016 CO 4, 364 P.3d 499.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The fourth factor dictated in Medina was met when the court reduced dosage of antipsychotic medication to minimize side effects suffered by plaintiff.
        </b>
        Clear and convincing evidence existed that the need for the drug, as ordered to be administered by the trial court, outweighed all legitimate interests the petitioner had in refusing such treatment. Donaldson v. District Court for the City and County of Denver, 847 P.2d 632 (Colo. 1993).

If such a facility is not available, the person may be taken to an emergency medical services facility.

Whenever in this article 65 a facility is to be designated or approved by the commissioner, hospitals, if available, must be approved or designated in each county before other facilities are approved or designated. Whenever in this article 65 a facility is to be designated or approved by the commissioner as a facility for a stated purpose and the facility to be designated or approved is a private facility, the consent of the private facility to the enforcement of standards set by the commissioner is a prerequisite to the designation or approval.

The application must indicate when the person was taken into custody and who brought the person's condition to the attention of the intervening professional or certified peace officer.

At the time of taking the respondent into custody, a copy of the petition and the order for evaluation must be given to the respondent and promptly thereafter to any one person designated by the respondent and to the person in charge of the seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation facility named in the order or the respondent's designee.

At the time the respondent is taken into custody, a copy of the petition and the order for evaluation must be given to the respondent and promptly thereafter to the one lay person designated by the respondent and to the person in charge of the facility named in the order or the respondent's designee. If the respondent refuses to accept a copy of the petition and the order for evaluation, such refusal must be documented in the petition and the order for evaluation.

        When a person is transported to an emergency medical services facility or a facility designated by the commissioner, the facility may detain the person under an emergency mental health hold for evaluation for a period not to exceed seventy-two hours from the time the emergency mental health hold was placed or ordered. Nothing in this section prohibits an emergency medical services facility from involuntarily holding the person in order to stabilize the person as required pursuant to the federal "Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act", 42 U.S.C. sec. 1395dd, or if the treating professional determines that the individual's physical or mental health disorder impairs the person's ability to make an informed decision to refuse care and the provider determines that further care is indicated. If, in the opinion of the person in charge of the evaluation, the person can be properly cared for without being detained, the person shall be provided services on a voluntary basis. If the person in charge of the evaluation determines the person should be released, the person in charge of the evaluation may terminate the emergency mental health hold.

The evaluation may include an assessment to determine if the person continues to meet the criteria for an emergency mental health hold and requires further mental health care in a facility designated by the commissioner. The evaluation must state whether the person should be released, referred for further care and treatment on a voluntary basis, or certified for short-term treatment pursuant to section 27-65-109.

If the facility places the person under a subsequent emergency mental health hold, the facility shall immediately notify the BHA, the person's lay person, and the court, and the court shall immediately appoint an attorney to represent the person. The facility may notify the court where the person resides by mail. Once the court is notified, the emergency medical services facility is not required to take any further action to provide the person with an attorney unless specified in subsection (10) of this section. The emergency medical services facility shall notify the BHA after each emergency mental health hold is placed. The BHA is responsible for actively assisting the facility in locating appropriate placement for the person. If the person has been recently transferred from an emergency medical services facility to a facility designated by the commissioner and the designated facility is able to demonstrate that the facility is unable to complete the evaluation before the initial emergency mental health hold is set to expire, the designated facility may place the person under a subsequent emergency mental health hold and shall immediately notify the BHA and lay person.

         Private hospital and privately employed doctor and nurse were not "state actors"
        </b>
        who could be held liable for a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Wittner v. Banner Health, 720 F.3d 770 (10th Cir. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section's grant of authority for a short-term involuntary hold in a private hospital does not pass the nexus/compulsion test for turning the private action of the hospital or the certifying doctor into state action. Wittner v. Banner Health, 720 F.3d 770 (10th Cir. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Involuntary commitment of the mentally ill is not a public function, that is, a traditional and exclusive function of the state, and thus state action. Wittner v. Banner Health, 720 F.3d 770 (10th Cir. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Private actor not transformed into a state actor under a joint action test. Allowing a hospital to hold a patient does not make the state responsible for a doctor's decision to medicate the patient, depriving the patient of constitutional rights. Wittner v. Banner Health, 720 F.3d 770 (10th Cir. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        State's relationship with a private actor is no more than the mere private purchase of contract services. Public-private relationship did not transcend that of mere client and contractor because the private and public actors did not commingle their responsibilities. The state lacked the authority to unilaterally place patients at the hospital; it merely authorized the hospital to accept patients if it so chose. Wittner v. Banner Health, 720 F.3d 770 (10th Cir. 2013).

The court shall issue an order of long-term care and treatment for a term not to exceed six months, discharge the respondent for whom long-term care and treatment was sought, or enter any other appropriate order. An order for long-term care and treatment must grant custody of the respondent to the BHA for placement with an agency or facility designated by the commissioner to provide long-term care and treatment. The BHA may delegate the physical custody of the respondent to a facility designated by the commissioner and the requirement for the provision of services and care coordination. When a petition contains a request that a specific legal disability be imposed or that a specific legal right be deprived, the court may order the disability imposed or the right deprived if the court or a jury has determined that the respondent has a mental health disorder or is gravely disabled and that, as a result, the respondent is unable to competently exercise the specific legal right or perform the function for which the disability is sought to be imposed. Any interested person may ask leave of the court to intervene as a copetitioner for the purpose of seeking the imposition of a legal disability or the deprivation of a legal right.

        An original order of long-term care and treatment or any extension of such order expires on the date specified, unless further extended as provided in this subsection (5). If an extension is being sought, the professional person in charge of the evaluation and treatment shall certify to the court at least thirty days prior to the expiration date of the order in force that an extension of the order is necessary for the care and treatment of the respondent subject to the order in force, and a copy of the certification must be simultaneously delivered to the respondent and electronically delivered to the respondent's attorney of record. At least twenty days before the expiration of the order, the court shall give written notice to the respondent and the respondent's attorney of record that a hearing upon the extension may be had before the court or a jury upon written request to the court within ten days after receipt of the notice. If a hearing is not requested by the respondent within such time, the court may proceed ex parte. If a hearing is timely requested, the hearing must be held before the expiration date of the order in force. If the court or jury finds that the conditions of subsection (1) of this section continue to be met and that the respondent has a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, is a danger to others or to the respondent's self or is gravely disabled, the court shall issue an extension of the order. Any extension must not exceed six months, but there may be as many extensions as the court orders pursuant to this section.

       <li id="t27a65s27-65-110ol16">
        A respondent certified for long-term care and treatment may be discharged from the facility upon the signature of the treating professional person and medical director of the facility, and the facility shall notify the BHA prior to the respondent's discharge. The facility shall make the respondent's discharge instructions available to the respondent, the respondent's attorney, the respondent's lay person, and the respondent's legal guardian, if applicable, within one week after discharge, if requested. A facility that is transferring a respondent to a different facility or to an outpatient program shall provide all treatment records to the facility or provider accepting the respondent at least twenty-four hours prior to the transfer.

        <b>
         The term "danger" in subsection (1)(a) does not offend due process
        </b>
        as long as the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the individual's mental illness results in a present danger to herself or others or renders her gravely disabled. People v. Stevens, 761 P.2d 768 (Colo. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Less restrictive alternatives need not be considered as a condition precedent to certification.
        </b>
        Civil commitment constitutes a severe infringement of liberty requiring due process protection. However, the statutory scheme set forth in this article contains a number of procedural safeguards that greatly reduce the inherent risk of erroneous deprivation. Therefore, due process does not require a mandatory hearing at the time of certification since the statute provides for a hearing on request. People v. Stevens, 761 P.2d 768 (Colo. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

         These statutory requirements are mandatory

         Thus, the failure to deliver personally to a respondent in a mental health proceeding a copy of the petition for long-term care and treatment, as required by subsection (2),
        </b>
        deprives the court of personal jurisdiction over the respondent to proceed on the petition and does not toll the relevant time limits for a hearing on the petition. Gilford v. People, 2 P.3d 120 (Colo. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         But only statutory deviations that are considered serious enough to undermine the confidence in the fairness and outcome of judicial proceedings will justify a dismissal of an order that was not made in strict compliance with procedural aspects of the civil commitment statutes.
        </b>
        Hearing for extension of long-term care and treatment and for administration of involuntary medications that took place six days after expiration of respondent's certification was held not to undermine the confidence in the fairness and outcome of the certification proceedings when respondent received a full hearing and had previously declined to have the hearing before the expiration date of the certification. People in Interest of Gilford, 983 P.2d 156 (Colo. App. 1999), cert. denied, No. 99SC404 (Colo. Aug. 23, 1999).

       <p>
        <b>
         Key inquiry in determining whether a failure to follow the civil commitment statute was a violation of an individual's due process rights is whether the failure violates an "essential condition" of the statute.
        </b>
        Such determination is made by evaluating the gravity of the deviation from the statutory procedures and requires consideration of any due process concerns and any prejudice to the respondent.

         Standard of care for determining release.

        In determining whether to release an involuntarily committed mental patient, the psychiatrist has a legal duty to exercise due care, consistent with the knowledge and skill ordinarily possessed by psychiatric practitioners under similar circumstances to determine whether the patient has a propensity for violence and would present an unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm to others.

        Given the state's obvious interest in protecting the public from those who previously have engaged in overt criminal conduct but have been relieved of criminal responsibility by reason of legal insanity, there is no difficulty in finding a rational basis for legislation that proscribes as criminal a knowing escape by a person committed to an institution as a result of an insanity adjudication in a criminal case, but does not impose a similar sanction upon a person who escapes from a facility to which he has been civilly committed.

        The second Medina element requires a patient to be deteriorating, which does not mean the same thing as "not improving". A patient who is simply not improving will not satisfy the Medina test for forcible administration of medication. People v. Marquardt, 2016 CO 4, 364 P.3d 499.

         The statutory authorization to forcibly administer medication related to mental illnesses does not grant the state unlimited authority to administer any medical treatment or medication,

        even if the four Medina factors are satisfied. The involuntary chemical castration of a person committed by the state to the care of the state hospital by virtue of his mental illness may only be authorized by the general assembly through statute, which it is not.

         The possibility that a certain medication may no longer be an effective treatment, or may not be taken voluntarily, at some unspecified time in the future

       The general assembly finds that many parents in Colorado experience challenging circumstances because their children have significant mental health needs. Many times, the parents are loving, caring parents who have become increasingly frustrated in their attempts to navigate the various governmental systems, including child welfare, mental health, law enforcement, juvenile justice, education, and youth services, in an attempt to find help for their children. Frequently in these situations, an action in dependency or neglect under article 3 of title 19 is neither appropriate nor warranted.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a67s27-67-102ol12">
       The general assembly finds that it is desirable to assist children and youth with mental health needs and their families. The general assembly further finds that it is desirable to make mental health services more available to families who want treatment for their children. The general assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide a full range of mental health treatment services, including residential care, to children and youth who are not eligible for medicaid. The general assembly further finds that, although the mental health agencies are responsible for providing or coordinating the full range of mental health treatment services, including residential care, for those children and youth who have been found to be categorically eligible for medicaid, there remains a population of children and youth in need of mental health services who are not categorically eligible for medicaid. Accordingly, the general assembly determines that it is appropriate to adopt a program pursuant to which a continuum of services would be provided to these children and youth.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a67s27-67-102ol13">
       The general assembly therefore finds that children and youth who are categorically eligible for medicaid and who may be eligible for mental health treatment services, including residential care, may need support in identifying clear appeals processes.

         A parent or guardian may apply to a mental health agency on behalf of a child or youth for mental health treatment services for the child or youth pursuant to this section, if the parent or guardian believes the child or youth is at risk of out-of-home placement. The parent's or guardian's request for services described in this section may be done with assistance from a family advocate, family systems navigator, nonprofit advocacy organization, or county department; however, the BHA is not obligated to pay for any services provided by entities with which they do not contract. In such circumstances, the mental health agency is responsible for evaluating the child or youth and clinically assessing the child's or youth's need for mental health services and, when warranted, to provide treatment services as necessary and in the best interests of the child or youth and the child's or youth's family. When evaluating a child or youth for eligibility, the mental health agency shall use a standardized risk stratification tool, in a manner determined by rule of the state board of human services. Following the evaluation of the child or youth, the mental health agency shall provide a written notification to the child's or youth's parent or guardian that includes a comprehensive list of potential treatment providers, with a disclosure that the child's or youth's family may choose to seek services from the provider of their choice, including but not limited to the mental health agency. The written notification must also inform the child's or youth's family that they may request assistance from a family advocate, family systems navigator, nonprofit advocacy organization, or county department; however, the BHA is not obligated to pay for any services provided by entities with which they do not contract. The BHA shall maintain a list of available providers on a public website and shall update the website quarterly. The mental health agency is responsible for the provision of the treatment services and care management, including any residential treatment, community-based care, or any post-residential follow-up services that may be appropriate for the child's or youth's needs or the child's or youth's family's needs. A dependency or neglect action pursuant to article 3 of title 19 is not required in order to allow a family access to residential mental health treatment services for a child or youth.

         At the time of the assessment by the mental health agency, if requested services are denied, or at the time when the mental health agency has recommended that the child or youth be discharged from services, the mental health agency shall advise the family, both orally and in writing, of the appeal process available to them. The mental health agency shall have two working days within which to complete any internal appeal process. Within five working days after the mental health agency's final denial or recommendation for discharge, a parent or guardian may request an objective third party at the BHA who is a professional person to review the action of the mental health agency. A family advocate, family systems navigator, nonprofit advocacy organization, or county department may assist a family in filing an appeal; however, the BHA is not obligated to pay for any services provided by entities with which they do not contract. The review must occur within three working days of the parent's or guardian's request. The professional person shall determine if the requested services are appropriate.

A family advocate, family system navigator, or county department may assist a family in filing an appeal. The review must occur within three working days of the parent's or guardian's request.

Within ten working days after the referral, if assigned for an assessment by the county department, a representative of the mental health agency shall meet with the county department and the family. Upon referral to the county department, if assigned for an assessment, the county department shall proceed with the assessment to determine whether there is a sufficient basis to believe that physical or sexual abuse or neglect or some other form of abuse or neglect of a child's or youth's physical well-being has occurred.

       The general assembly recognizes the character and pervasiveness of substance use disorders and that substance use disorders are serious problems. The general assembly further finds and declares that these problems have been very seriously neglected and that the social and economic costs and the waste of human resources caused by substance use disorders are massive, tragic, and no longer acceptable. The general assembly believes that the best interests of this state demand an across-the-board, locally oriented attack on the massive problems of drug abuse and substance use disorders. The attack includes prevention, education, and treatment, and this article 81 provides a base from which to launch the attack and reduce the tragic human loss.

       In accordance with the provisions of this article 81, the BHA shall establish standards for approved treatment facilities that receive public funds. A treatment facility shall meet the established standards to be approved as a public or private treatment facility. The BHA shall fix the fees to be charged for the required inspections. The fees charged to approved treatment facilities that provide level I and level II programs, as provided in section 42-4-1301.3 (3)(c), must be transmitted to the state treasurer, who shall credit the fees to the alcohol and drug driving safety program fund created in section 42-4-1301.3 (4)(a).

If the person being detained is a juvenile, as defined in section 19-2.5-102, the juvenile must be placed in a setting that is nonsecure and physically segregated by sight and sound from the adult offenders. A law enforcement officer or emergency service patrol officer, in detaining the person, is taking the person into protective custody. In so doing, the detaining officer may protect himself or herself by reasonable methods but shall make every reasonable effort to protect the detainee's health and safety. A taking into protective custody pursuant to this section is not an arrest, and an entry or other record shall not be made to indicate that the person has been arrested or charged with a crime. Law enforcement or emergency service personnel who act in compliance with this section are acting in the course of their official duties and are not criminally or civilly liable. Nothing in this subsection (1) precludes a person intoxicated by alcohol, under the influence of drugs, or incapacitated by substances who is not dangerous to the health and safety of himself, herself, or others from being assisted to the person's home or like location by the law enforcement officer or emergency service patrol officer.

         A sheriff or police chief who violates the provisions of subsection (1)(a) of this section related to detaining juveniles may be subject to a civil fine of no more than one thousand dollars. The decision to fine shall be based on prior violations of the provisions of subsection (1)(a) of this section by the sheriff or police chief and the willingness of the sheriff or police chief to address the violations in order to comply with subsection (1)(a) of this section.

       A law enforcement officer, emergency service patrol officer, physician, spouse, guardian, or relative of the person to be committed or any other responsible person may make a written application for emergency commitment under this section, directed to the administrator of the approved treatment facility. The application must state the circumstances requiring emergency commitment, including the applicant's personal observations and the specific statements of others, if any, upon which the applicant relies in making the application. A copy of the application must be furnished to the person to be committed.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-111ol13">
       If the administrator approves the application, the administrator shall commit, evaluate, and treat the person for a period not to exceed five days. A peace officer, the emergency service patrol, or any interested person shall bring the person to the facility. If necessary, the court may be contacted to issue an order to the police, the peace officer's department, or the sheriff's department to transport the person to the facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-111ol14">
       If the administrator determines that the application fails to sustain the grounds for emergency commitment as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the administrator shall refuse the commitment, immediately release the detained person, and encourage the person to seek voluntary treatment, if appropriate.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-111ol15">
       When the administrator determines that the grounds for commitment no longer exist, the administrator shall discharge the person committed under this section. A person committed under this section must not be detained in any treatment facility for more than five days; except that a person may be detained for longer than five days at the approved treatment facility if, in that period of time, a petition for involuntary commitment has been filed pursuant to section 27-81-112. A person must not be detained longer than ten days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the date of filing of the petition for involuntary commitment unless a valid medical reason exists for detaining a person longer.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-111ol16">
       Whenever a person is involuntarily detained pursuant to this section, the administrator shall, within twenty-four hours after detainment, advise the person who is involuntarily detained, both orally and in writing, of the person's right to challenge the detention by application to the courts for a writ of habeas corpus, to be represented by counsel at every stage of any proceedings relating to commitment and recommitment, and to have counsel appointed by the court or provided by the court if the person wants the assistance of counsel and is unable to obtain counsel.

       <b>
        Due process considerations.
       </b>
       A judicial hearing as a prerequisite to commitment of a clearly dangerous intoxicated person would hinder the government's efforts in controlling alcohol abuse without providing additional procedural safeguards. Due process demands only that a neutral fact finder independently determine that the statutory requirements for commitment and release are satisfied. Due process does not dictate that the neutral and detached fact finder be law-trained or a judicial or administrative officer. Carberry v. Adams County Task Force on Alcoholism, 672 P.2d 206 (Colo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Intent of subsection (1).
       </b>
       In enacting subsection (1), the general assembly did not intend the police to take into protective custody every intoxicated person they meet. Rather, the general assembly designated a specific class of intoxicated persons who are subject to emergency commitment and left the determination of whether a particular individual is clearly dangerous to the police. Therefore, the decision to take a person into protective custody is discretionary and protected by official immunity. Leake v. Cain, 720 P.2d 152 (Colo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Class of persons section was designated to protect.
       </b>
       Respondents-decedents are not included within the class of persons that subsection (1) was designated to protect, since the statutory intent was not to protect members of the public against intoxicated persons. Therefore, police officers had no duty to take defendant into "protective custody" or to escort him to his home. Leake v. Cain, 720 P.2d 152 (Colo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The language of this section indisputably articulates a clear legislative determination that the act of taking a person into civil protective custody is not an arrest.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In order to take an individual into protective custody under this section, an officer must have probable cause to believe

        A pat-down search under this section is justified by a reasonable concern for police officer safety as balanced against a limited intrusion into an individual's expectation of privacy.

      <p>
       <b>
        The inventory search of a civil detainee does not permit officers to search closed containers without a warrant.

      <p>
       <b>
        Limited pat-down search of person being taken into protective custody did not violate the fourth amendment
       </b>
       of the U.S. constitution, and the pistol discovered during that search need not be suppressed, because the police officer had probable cause to initiate the process of taking the person into protective custody. United States v. Gilmore, 945 F. Supp. 2d 1211 (D. Colo. 2013).

       27-81-112. Involuntary commitment of a person with a substance use disorder.

     </h3>

      <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol11">
       The court may commit a person to the custody of the BHA upon the petition of the person's spouse or guardian, a relative, a physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, the administrator in charge of an approved treatment facility, a certified peace officer, or any other responsible person. The petition must allege that the person has a substance use disorder and that the person has threatened or attempted to inflict or inflicted physical harm on the person's self or on another and that unless committed, the person is likely to inflict physical harm on the person's self or on another or that the person is incapacitated by substances. A refusal to undergo treatment does not constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment. The petition must be accompanied by a certificate of a licensed physician who has examined the person within ten days before submission of the petition, unless the person whose commitment is sought has refused to submit to a medical examination, in which case the fact of refusal must be alleged in the petition, or an examination cannot be made of the person due to the person's condition. The certificate must set forth the physician's findings in support of the petition's allegations.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol12">
       A court shall not accept a petition submitted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section unless there is documentation of the refusal by the person to be committed to accessible and affordable voluntary treatment. The documentation may include, but is not limited to, notations in the person's medical or law enforcement records or statements by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or witness.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol13">
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol13a">
         Upon filing the petition, the person whose commitment is sought must be notified of the person's right to:

          <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol13aI">
           Enter into a stipulated order of the court for committed treatment in order to expedite placement in an approved treatment facility by the BHA; or

         If the person whose commitment is sought exercises the right to contest the petition, the court shall fix a date for a hearing no later than ten days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the date the petition was filed. A copy of the petition and the notice of the hearing, including the date fixed by the court, must be personally served on the petitioner, the person whose commitment is sought, and one of the person's parents or the person's legal guardian if the person is a minor. A copy of the petition and notice of hearing must be provided to the BHA, to counsel for the person whose commitment is sought, to the administrator in charge of the approved treatment facility to which the person may have been committed for emergency treatment, and to any other person the court believes advisable.

      <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol14">
       At the hearing, the court shall hear all relevant testimony, including, if possible, the testimony of at least one licensed physician who has examined the person whose commitment is sought. The person must be present unless the court believes that the person's presence is likely to be injurious to the person; in this event, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the person throughout the proceeding. If the person has refused to be examined by a licensed physician, the person must be given an opportunity to be examined by a court-appointed licensed physician. If the person refuses and there is sufficient evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true or if the court believes that more medical evidence is necessary, the court may commit the person to a licensed hospital for a period of not more than five days for a diagnostic examination. In such event, the court shall schedule a further hearing for final determination of commitment, in no event later than five days after the first hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol15">
       If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination by the licensed hospital, the court finds that grounds for involuntary commitment have been established by clear and convincing proof, the court shall make an order of commitment to the BHA. The BHA has the right to delegate physical custody of the person to an appropriate approved treatment facility. The court may not order commitment of a person unless the court determines that the BHA is able to provide adequate and appropriate treatment for the person, and the treatment is likely to be beneficial.
      </li>
      <li id="t27a81s27-81-112ol16">
       Upon the court's commitment of a person to the BHA, the court may issue an order to the sheriff to transport the person to the facility designated by the BHA.

If a person has been committed because the person is a person with a substance use disorder who is likely to inflict physical harm on another, the BHA shall apply for recommitment if, after examination, it is determined that the likelihood to inflict physical harm on another still exists.

       A person who is recommitted as provided for in subsection (7) of this section and who has not been discharged by the BHA before the end of the ninety-day period is discharged at the expiration of that ninety-day period unless the BHA, before expiration of the ninety-day period, obtains a court order on the grounds set forth in subsection (1) of this section for recommitment for a further period, not to exceed ninety days. If a person has been committed because the person is a person with a substance use disorder who is likely to inflict physical harm on another, the BHA shall apply for recommitment if, after examination, it is determined that the likelihood to inflict physical harm on another still exists. Only two recommitment orders pursuant to subsection (7) of this section and this subsection (8) are permitted.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that facilities that provide treatment to individuals with a substance use disorder, including medication-assisted treatment, and clinics that provide obstetric and gynecological health-care services would better serve pregnant and postpartum women if the services could be coordinated and provided to women at the same location. It is the intent of the general assembly to fund a pilot program to integrate these health-care services at specified facilities and clinics and require the BHA to evaluate the pilot program and report the results of the pilot program to the general assembly.

          The general assembly hereby finds and declares that currently there are no juvenile detention facilities with commitment beds or locked detention beds in the southwest portion of Colorado and that the nearest such facility in the Grand Junction or Glenwood Springs area is as much as four hours away from some southwestern communities. As a result of this distance, authorities in the southwest region of the state often avoid detention even though such avoidance presents a public safety problem, and those juveniles who are taken to distant facilities lose the critical access to family members and local community agencies that would otherwise render their transitional return to the community less difficult.

          The general assembly further finds and declares that the juvenile population in detention is expected to increase by seventy and nine hundredths percent by the year 2002. In addition, the general assembly finds and declares that the juvenile commitment population is expected to increase by forty-nine and nine-tenths percent by the year 2002. The general assembly finds and declares that the growth patterns on the western slope of the state have led to a growth in population of at-risk youth and increased crime and that the office of youth services accordingly has experienced a shortfall of both detention and commitment beds in the western part of the state.
         </li>
         <li id="t27a90s27-90-105ol11c">

        The general assembly recognizes that many of the individuals receiving services from department employees pursuant to title 26 or this title 27 are unable to defend themselves and are therefore vulnerable to abuse or assault. It is the intent of the general assembly to minimize the potential for hiring and employing persons with a propensity toward abuse, assault, or similar offenses against others for positions that would provide them with unsupervised access to vulnerable persons. The general assembly declares that, in accordance with section 13 of article XII of the state constitution, for purposes of terminating employees in the state personnel system who are finally convicted of criminal conduct, offenses involving moral turpitude include, but are not limited to, the disqualifying offenses specified in subsection (9) of this section.

        Prior to the department's permanent employment of a person in a position that would require that person to have direct contact with a vulnerable person, the executive director or any division head of the department shall make an inquiry to the director of the Colorado bureau of investigation to ascertain whether the person has a criminal history. The person's employment is conditional upon a satisfactory state and national fingerprint-based criminal history record check. A record check conducted pursuant to this subsection (4) must include but need not be limited to arrests, conviction records, and the disposition of any criminal charges. The department shall require the person to have the person's fingerprints taken by a local law enforcement agency or any third party approved by the Colorado bureau of investigation. If an approved third party takes the person's fingerprints, the fingerprints may be electronically captured using Colorado bureau of investigation-approved livescan equipment. Third-party vendors shall not keep the applicant information for more than thirty days unless requested to do so by the applicant. The department shall forward those fingerprints to the Colorado bureau of investigation for the purpose of fingerprint processing utilizing the files and records of the Colorado bureau of investigation and the federal bureau of investigation. When the results of a fingerprint-based criminal history record check of a person performed pursuant to this section reveal a record of arrest without a disposition, the department shall require that person to submit to a name-based judicial record check, as defined in section 22-2-119.3 (6)(d).

        </b>
        The liability which attaches for accrued costs of maintenance and care in a public institution under former ยง 27-12-101 becomes a debt upon determination by the department of institutions that the relative is able to pay.

        In the absence of a determination of ability to pay or an actual assessment, this section does not permit the collection of hospital expenses up to the amount of the insurance benefits payable for such expenses nor may the state maintain an action to recover for the costs of hospital care. State ex rel. Fort Logan Mental Health Center v. Harwood, 34 Colo. App. 213, 524 P.2d 614 (1974).
