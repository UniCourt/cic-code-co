     Editor's note:
    </b>
    This title was primarily numbered as articles within chapter 139, C.R.S. 1963; however, a few sections were located in article 1 of chapter 140, C.R.S. 1963. The provisions of this title were repealed and reenacted in 1975, resulting in the addition, relocation, and elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to this title prior to 1975, consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note and the table itemizing the replacement volumes and supplements to the original volume of C.R.S. 1973 beginning on page vii in the front of this volume. Former C.R.S. section numbers are shown in editor's notes following those sections that were relocated. For a detailed comparison of this title, see the comparative tables located in the back of the index.

       In the recodification of this title, certain provisions which previously applied or may have been interpreted to apply to limited categories of municipalities have been applied to all municipalities, whether statutory, home rule, or special territorial charter. Except for those provisions which expressly apply only to limited categories of municipalities, it is the intent of the general assembly that the provisions of this title shall apply to home rule municipalities except insofar as superseded by charter or ordinance passed pursuant to such charter and to all statutory cities and towns and shall be available to special territorial charter cities and towns unless in conflict with the charters thereof. The general assembly further declares that in the recodification of this title and in the use of the term "municipality" in this title there is no legislative intent to affect or modify the application of the provisions of this title with respect to preemption of home rule or special territorial charter powers, which preemption may or may not have existed on the effective date of this recodification (July 1, 1975). The use of the term "municipality" in future additions or amendments to this title shall not in and of itself create a presumption for or against preemption of home rule or special territorial charter powers.

       Where any power is granted in this title to a specific municipal official or group of officials, that power may be exercised within any home rule municipality by the officials, to the extent and in the manner, designated in the particular home rule charter or ordinance passed pursuant to such charter.

       is to preserve the existence of cities and towns which had been incorporated under general laws enacted prior to, and repealed by, the act of 1877; had the saving clause not been added, such cities and towns might have gone out of existence, as legal entities.

       A petition for the incorporation of a town, signed by the requisite number of names, a part of whom were not bona fide electors and landowners so that the number of bona fide electors and landowners signing the petition was less than the number required by this section, would not give the district court jurisdiction, and the incorporation of a town based upon such petition is void.

        "Embraced" defined.
       </b>
       The familiar and generally accepted meaning of the word "embraced" in the first sentence is: "encircled, enclosed, encompassed". Therefore, an area completely encircled by and enclosed and encompassed within the exterior limits of a city cannot be incorporated. In re Incorporation of Town of Eastridge v.

        The particular grounds on which the incorporation, organization, or annexation may be attacked by a quo warranto proceeding include

       There is no reason why those who object to the incorporation of a town should not enter appearance in the proceeding in the district court and there present their protests. A hearing thereon in regular manner would make for orderly proceedings on direct issues and forestall round-about attacks in an effort to accomplish indirectly that which could much better be pursued by direct method and having entered appearance and protest, in event of adverse judgment, review by writ of error would be in order. Neither is this the only avenue available where it is contended that the county court was without or exceeded its jurisdiction, or abused its discretion, since C.R.C.P. 106(a)(4) provides a "plain, speedy, and adequate remedy".

        <b>
         Annotator's note.
        </b>
        Since § 31-2-106 is similar to former §§ 31-1-108 and 31-1-109 prior to the 1975 repeal and reenactment of this title, and laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Legal existence conclusively presumed.
        </b>
        The legal existence of a municipal corporation will be conclusively presumed under this section when, without question, a board of municipal officers exercising their official duties has been maintained for more than one year (now six months). People v. Curley, 5 Colo. 412 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it appears that a town, acting as such, has, for more than 12 years, exercised the powers of a municipal corporation, and for more than two years has had a full complement of officials, exercising their offices, the regularity of its organization is conclusively presumed. Lavelle v. Town of Julesburg, 49 Colo. 290, 112 P. 774 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Compliance with § 31-2-105 prerequisite to application of this section.
        </b>
        Where a decree rendered under § 31-1-105 (now § 31-2-103) recited that a town was adjudged incorporated "upon the further compliance with the law in such cases made and provided", the quoted phrase had reference to § 31-3-107 (now § 31-2-105) and a compliance with the provisions thereof was necessary before the limitation prescribed by this section would begin to run. Norton v. People ex rel. Rudbeck, 102 Colo. 489, 81 P.2d 393 (1938).

         The intent and purpose of subsection (3)
        </b>
        is to clothe the city in its governmental capacity with the entire title to the streets, as such, for public use, and not for the "profit or emolument of the city". City of Leadville v. Bohn Mining Co., 37 Colo. 248, 86 P. 1038 (1906).

       <p>
        <b>
         Upon the incorporation of a town, all avenues, streets, and alleys appearing on the map annexed to the petition for incorporation became public property
        </b>
        and the fee thereof became vested in the town. Brell v. Ovid, 88 Colo. 198, 293 P. 961 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Subsection (3) applies only to cities and towns
        </b>
        and does not apply to county or state highways. Buell v. Redding Miller, Inc., 163 Colo. 286, 430 P.2d 471 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Term "fee" means a "complete" title in city.
        </b>
        Because under subsection (3) the general assembly intended, by the use of the term "street", to vest in the city such estate or interest as is reasonable necessary to enable it to utilize the surface and so much of the ground underneath as might be required for laying gas pipes, building sewers, and other municipal purposes. In other words, the general assembly used the term "fee", not according to its technical legal meaning, but as vesting in the city a complete, perpetual, and continuous title to the space designated as streets, so long as it used them for the purpose intended. City of Leadville v. Bohn Mining Co., 37 Colo. 248, 86 P. 1038 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The fee passes by statutory dedication, unburden of a trust.

        <b>
         Where, in an action to recover lands formerly included in certain streets alleged to have reverted to the original grantor,
        </b>
        it appears from the complaint that the map or plat of the town was duly recorded in the office of the recorder of the county and that the plats of the streets in controversy were also duly recorded, it will be presumed as against the pleader that all the plats mentioned were made, certified, acknowledged, and recorded as required by law; and from a further allegation that this town was later included in another town duly incorporated, it will be presumed that the limits of the latter town were extended in the manner recognized by law, and that the title to said streets dedicated by the plats became vested therein by statutory dedication, which divests the original grantor of title without acceptance by the town, in accordance with this section. Bothwell v. Denver Union Stockyards Co., 39 Colo. 221, 90 P. 1127 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No statutory dedication.
        </b>
        When a plat plan specifically excludes an avenue from the dedication of other streets and avenues to public use, no statutory dedication of the excluded avenue has taken place. State Dept. of Highways v. Town of Silverthorne, 707 P.2d 1017 (Colo. App. 1985), cert. dismissed, 736 P.2d 411 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it was undisputed that land used as a park was not designated for public use on a map or plat, it was not statutorily dedicated as a park. Save Cheyenne v. City of Colo. Springs, 2018 COA 18, 425 P.3d 1174 (decided based on 1877 statutory language similar to subsection (3)).

      When any municipality incorporates under the provisions of this title or any municipality reorganizes under the provisions of part 3 of this article after the time for making the annual assessment for taxation has passed, the governing body of each such city or town may provide, by ordinance or resolution, for the assessment of taxable property within the corporate limits of said city or town. When such assessment is made and approved by the governing body, it may proceed to levy the necessary taxes for the fiscal year, which levy shall be certified by the clerk of such city or town to the county assessor, who shall extend the same upon the tax list of the current year, as required by section 31-20-104. The county treasurer shall proceed in the collection of such taxes in all respects as provided by law for the collection of taxes in cities and towns. It is not necessary for any such city or town to pass the annual appropriation ordinance or resolution required by section 29-1-108, C.R.S. This section shall apply only to the assessment and collection of taxes for the first fiscal year after such incorporation or reorganization.

       This section leaves room for a home rule municipality to establish the criteria for a proposed amendment to its charter. Because there was no conflict between the ordinances and the state constitution, the municipality could enforce its ordinances regulating the process for amending its charter. McCarville v.

        Ordinance requiring a single subject for citizen-initiated proposals to amend city charter does not alter the charter amendment process outlined in the Municipal Home Rule Act of 1971 (Act), but works in tandem with that process.
       </b>
       Neither the city charter nor the Act set requirements for proposed charter amendments. Because the Act's procedures are undisturbed by the city's single-subject rule, the rule does not conflict with or effectively amend the charter provision stating that the Act shall govern the submission of charter amendments.

       Under this section when the record of a special meeting kept by the clerk shows that the meeting was called for the purpose of transacting the very business which was transacted, and that every member of the council was present and participated in the proceedings, the presumption is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the meeting was a legal meeting duly and regularly called.

If such an ordinance is adopted, it shall also provide that any ordinance adopted and all resolutions authorizing the expenditure of money or the entering into of a contract shall be subject to disapproval by the mayor as provided in section 31-16-104. Such an ordinance may provide or may be amended to provide that the mayor shall not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum or the requisite majority on any matter to be voted on by the council. Any such ordinance may be adopted, amended, or repealed only within the sixty days preceding the election of any mayor, to take effect upon such mayor's assumption of office.

       <b>
        Annotator's note.
       </b>
       Since § 31-4-107 is similar to former §§ 31-3-101 and 31-5-105 prior to the 1975 repeal and reenactment of this title, and laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.

       <b>
        Council intended as election tribunal.
       </b>
       The general assembly intended, by the language used in this section, to designate the council in cities as the tribunal to try election contests between its members. Booth v. County Court, 18 Colo. 561, 33 P. 581 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Number of council votes required.
       </b>
       Since this section contains no provision concerning the number of council votes required to elect city officials, a vote of a majority of the members present, there being a quorum, is sufficient to elect, and the weight of authority is to the effect that a majority vote need not be a majority of those voting and a quorum is in fact present. People ex rel. Sanders v. Hendrick, 93 Colo. 512, 27 P.2d 493 (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Mayor's election cognizable.
       </b>
       Since the power to try election contests between its members is by this section plainly lodged with the common council, and since the mayor, by the express terms of § 31-4-102, is designated a member thereof, the contest of his election is expressly made cognizable by that body. Booth v. County Court, 18 Colo. 561, 33 P. 581 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Concurrent judicial jurisdiction.
       </b>
       Where the statute provides that the city council shall be the judge of the qualifications, election, and returns of its own members, the power given is declared to be simply cumulative, and the concurrent jurisdiction of the courts is maintained. Wells v. People ex rel. Dolan, 78 Colo. 77, 239 P. 726 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Suspension of rules by unanimous consent.
       </b>
       Such rules as the council itself may adopt, and which it is authorized to adopt to govern its own proceedings, may properly be suspended by unanimous consent. City of Greeley v. Hamman, 17 Colo. 30, 28 P. 460 (1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Additional duties may be imposed on clerk.
       </b>
       Under this section the council may, if they see fit so to do, impose upon the clerk, as clerk, in addition to those specified by statute, such other duties as, in their judgment, may be deemed appropriate. Orman v. City of Pueblo, 8 Colo. 292, 6 P. 931 (1885).
      </p>
      <p>
       Such as receipt of license moneys. There is nothing in the statute directly imposing upon the city clerk the duty of receiving moneys paid for licenses authorized to be issued, but under this section the council are clearly empowered thereby to require of him the performance of such duty. Orman v. City of Pueblo, 8 Colo. 292, 6 P. 931 (1885).

        Denial of hearing not violation of due process.
       </b>
       This section does not give rise to the type of expectancy to continued employment that serves as a ground for the existence of a property right protected by the fourteenth amendment. Therefore, no due process violation occurs in denying an employee a hearing on the city manager's decision to suspend or dismiss him. This is true regardless of whether the employee was gratuitously afforded an administrative hearing by the city manager, the procedural aspects of which were objected to by the employee. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D. Colo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section clearly indicates that an employee holds his position subject to the final decision of the city manager. The general assembly thereby specifically excluded the necessity of providing any procedure for an administrative hearing either before or after the city manager's decision. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D. Colo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not restrict the city manager's power to remove employees for particular causes.
       </b>
       DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D. Colo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The addition of the words "for cause" does not automatically create a constitutionally protected property right.
       </b>
       The entire statutory purpose must be considered in making such a determination. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D. Colo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And public employment is generally not such right.
       </b>
       Except in certain situations, as where an employee has formal tenure rights, public employment is generally not a constitutionally protected property interest. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D. Colo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       An allegation that the city and city manager infringed a constitutionally protected liberty interest when they terminated plaintiff's employment for reasons that affected his reputation and ability to obtain other employment opportunities was prima facie insufficient to state a claim that defendants violated a liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment since every suspension or dismissal will necessarily affect one's community reputation and will make it more difficult to obtain future employment. DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D. Colo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The "for cause" language in this section requires only that the city manager's decision not be arbitrary.
       </b>
       DeBono v. Vizas, 427 F. Supp. 905 (D. Colo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The power to remove employees included the power to suspend employees.
       </b>

       <b>
        It is unclear whether the general assembly intended subsection (2) to confer on employees a protected property interest in continued employment.
       </b>
       The statute's title and its language suggest that the legislature did not intend this particular statute to confer upon city employees an interest in their jobs. Rather, the legislature may have intended to clarify the powers of the city manager. Derda v. Brighton, Colo., City of, 53 F.3d 1162 (10th Cir. 1995).

       The city council, upon the report and recommendation of the city manager, has the power to create and establish by ordinance administrative departments of city administration. It is the duty of the city manager to propose a plan of administrative organization to the city council within sixty days after his appointment which, if approved by the city council, shall be adopted by ordinance.

The administrative plan shall also provide for a chief of police, a fire chief, a health officer, and such other officers as are deemed necessary for the efficient administration of the city, and such plan may or may not include, in the discretion of the city council, all of the officers named in sections 31-4-105 and 31-4-107. All such officers shall be appointed by the city manager as provided in section 31-4-211. This plan of the city manager shall be placed on file and shall be a matter of public record open to the examination and inspection of the public at all reasonable times. The city council, upon recommendation of the city manager, may change or abolish, by ordinance, any department or office established by ordinance, prescribe, distribute, or discontinue the functions and duties of departments and offices so established, or assign additional functions and duties to departments and offices.

       The trustees of any statutory town may be reduced in number from six to four or again increased from four to six in the manner provided in this section.

       When a petition signed by five percent of the registered electors of the town requesting an election for the purpose of reducing the number of trustees from six to four is presented to the board of trustees of the town or when the board determines by majority vote of the entire board that such a reduction in the size of the board would be in the interest of the town, the board shall adopt an ordinance calling for such an election, to be held within four calendar months from the date of presentation of the petition.

       Such election may be held in connection with any regular or special election. In the event that the issue is approved at the election, three members of the board of trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the legislative and corporate authority of the town shall be vested in the board of trustees consisting of one mayor and four trustees. The approval of a change reducing the number of trustees from six to four shall not have the effect of reducing the term for which any member of the board of trustees was previously elected.

       Where the number of trustees has been reduced from six to four, an election on the issue of increasing the number of trustees from four to six may be held at any time subsequent to two years following the election reducing the number of trustees from six to four. No new petition requesting an election to reduce or increase the number of trustees on the board of trustees may be filed or accepted by the board, nor may the board refer any such issue to the voters, for a period of two years following an election for the purpose of increasing or reducing the number of trustees.

If such an ordinance is adopted, it shall also provide that any ordinance adopted and all resolutions authorizing the expenditure of money or the entering into of a contract shall be subject to disapproval by the mayor as provided in section 31-16-104. Such an ordinance may provide or may be amended to provide that the mayor shall not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum or for the requisite majority on any matter to be voted on by the board of trustees. Any such ordinance may be adopted, amended, or repealed only within the sixty days preceding any election of a mayor, to take effect upon such mayor's assumption of office.

If a vacancy in the board or in such other elective office is not filled by appointment or an election is not ordered within sixty days after the vacancy occurs, the board shall order an election, subject to the municipal election code, to be held as soon as practicable to fill the vacancy until the next regular election and until a successor has been elected and has complied with section 31-4-401. At its first meeting, the board shall choose one of the trustees as mayor pro tem who, in the absence of the mayor from any meeting of said board or during the mayor's absence from the town or his inability to act, shall perform the mayor's duties. The board also has the power to elect a clerk pro tem to perform the duties of the clerk during his absence or inability to act.

        Constitutional grounds for removal.

       Under this section the holder of an elective office, duly elected by the people, should not be removed except for official misconduct, such misconduct as affects the performance of his duties as an officer, and for offenses against the corporation of a character directly affecting its rights and interests, and this conclusion is clearly sustainable on constitutional grounds.

        The power of removal must be exercised under the same limitations, precautions, and sanctions as in other judicial proceedings,

       and the regularity of the proceedings and the legality of the removal must always be open to review in the courts. Bd. of Trustees v. People ex rel. Keith, 13 Colo. App. 553, 59 P. 72 (1899).

        Mere recital in board minutes insufficient.
       </b>
       Upon proceedings in mandamus, to contest the right of removal, it is incumbent upon the person or persons attempting to remove respondent to show that such charges were preferred, and that they were sustained by legal evidence, and the mere recital in the minutes of the board that there was evidence offered, and that the board found the accused guilty is not sufficient.

       When no ordinance had ever been adopted by a town creating an office of deputy marshal and a plaintiff had never been hired or appointed other than as a deputy marshal, then he is not one of those town officers who is entitled to the protection of the removal provisions of the statute, and therefore he can be summarily discharged.

        Voting rights preserved by expressing intent to return.
       </b>
       Elector, who had moved outside city and into a rental home while he awaited building of new home within the city, preserved his right to vote in the city by expressing an intent to retain the city as his "official place of residence". Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1980).

        But mere intention alone may not fulfill legal residence requirements.
       </b>
       The mere intention to return to a former abode at some more or less indefinite time, with no other indicia of a home or domicile, may not fulfill the usual requirements of "legal residence" for voting purposes. Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1980).

       <b>
        Inquiry to be undertaken where nonresident elector wishes to retain former voting rights.
       </b>
       The following inquiry must be undertaken if an elector has moved outside the boundaries of his voting precinct and wishes to retain his right to vote there: (1) Had the party established his principal or primary home or place of abode within the election precinct? and (2) was the individual's departure taken or does his absence continue with a "present intention of returning" to the precinct in the future?

        Because they have sufficient evidentiary support, trial court's findings that defendant had satisfied residency requirements necessary to hold office in Telluride, Colorado, and had not abandoned her principal or primary home in Colorado will not be disturbed.
       </b>
       Trial court found defendant became a resident of Colorado in May of 1998. Defendant's return to New York was intended to be temporary and she did not lose her residency by her return to New York. Although defendant's voting and tax returns suggested New York residency, those acts were not sufficient to abandon her residency in Colorado. Circumstances justified trial court's conclusion that Telluride was defendant's principal or primary home. Zivian v. Brooke-Hitching, 28 P.3d 970 (Colo. App. 2001).

     <p>
      Every registered elector eighteen years of age or older on the date of the election may circulate a nominating petition and hold office in any municipality, unless another age is required by local charter or ordinance, if he or she has resided in the municipality or municipality and ward, as the case may be, from which he or she is to be elected for a period of at least twelve consecutive months immediately preceding the date of the election. In case of an annexation, any person who has resided within the territory annexed for the prescribed time shall be deemed to have met the residence requirements for the municipality and precinct to which the territory was annexed. No person may be a candidate for two municipal offices at the same election nor hold two elective municipal offices simultaneously; except that, in statutory cities, the offices of clerk and treasurer may be sought and held by the same person.

       Candidates for municipal offices shall be nominated, without regard to affiliation, by petition on forms supplied by the clerk. A petition of nomination may consist of one or more sheets, but it shall contain the name and address of only one candidate and shall indicate the office to which the candidate is seeking election.
      </li>

       Nomination petitions may be circulated and signed beginning on the ninety-first day and ending on the seventy-first day prior to the day of election. Each petition must be signed by registered electors in the following numbers:

The registered elector, or the person printing on behalf of the registered elector, may use any abbreviations that reasonably identify the residence of the registered elector, and the date the registered elector signed the petition. The circulator of each nomination petition shall make an affidavit that each signature thereon is the signature of the person whose name it purports to be and that each signer has stated to the circulator that the signer is a registered elector of the municipality or municipality and ward, as the case may be, for which the nomination is made. The signature of each signer of a petition shall constitute prima facie evidence of his qualifications without the requirement that each signer make an affidavit as to his qualifications.

       No petition is valid that does not contain the requisite number of signatures of registered electors.

Such inspection may consist of an examination of the information on the signature lines for patent defects, a comparison of the information on the signature lines with a list of registered electors provided by the county, or any other method of inspection reasonably expected to ensure compliance with this section. Any petition may be amended to correct or replace those signatures that the clerk finds are not in apparent conformity with the requirements of this section at any time prior to sixty-three days before the day of election.

       No registered elector shall sign more than one nomination petition for each separate office to be filled in his municipality or municipality and ward, as the case may be. Each office of the governing body that is to be filled by the electorate shall be considered a separate office for the purpose of nomination. In municipalities in which offices of the governing body are filled both by election from wards and election at large, an elector may sign a nomination petition for each office to be filled from his ward and also for each office to be filled by election at large. If a registered elector's signature appears on more than one nomination petition for a particular office, the clerk may utilize the date of signing indicated on the nomination petitions to determine which signature was valid when affixed to the nomination petitions. If the date of signing does not clarify which signature was valid, all signatures of such registered elector shall be rejected.

The acceptance of nomination shall contain the place of residence of the candidate and the name of the candidate in the form that the candidate wishes it to appear on the ballot.

They shall first count the number of ballots in the box. If the ballots are found to exceed the number of names entered on the pollbook, the judges of election shall then examine the official endorsements upon the outside of the ballots without opening the same, and if, in the unanimous opinion of the judges, any of the ballots in excess of the number on the pollbook do not bear the proper official endorsement, they shall be put into a separate pile by themselves, and a separate record and return of the votes in such ballots shall be made under the head of "excess ballots". When the ballots and the pollbook agree, the judges of election shall proceed to count the votes. Each ballot shall be read and counted separately, and every name separately marked as voted for on such ballot, where there is no conflict to obscure the intention of the voter, shall be read and marked upon the tally sheets before any other ballot is proceeded with. The entire number of ballots, excepting "excess ballots", shall be read and counted and placed upon the tally sheets in like manner. When all of the ballots, excepting "excess ballots", have been counted, the judges of election shall estimate and publish the votes.

      If a voter marks in ink or indelible pencil more names than there are persons to be elected to an office or if, for any reason, it is impossible to determine the choice of any voter for any office to be filled, his ballot shall not be counted for such office. A defective or an incomplete cross marked on any ballot in ink in a proper place shall be counted if there is no other mark or cross in ink or indelible pencil on such ballot indicating an intention to vote for some person other than those indicated by the first mentioned defective cross or mark. No ballot without the official endorsement, except as provided in section 31-10-805, shall be deposited in the ballot box, and none but ballots provided in accordance with the provisions of this article shall be counted. When the judges of election in any precinct discover in the counting of votes that the name of any candidate voted for is misspelled or the initial letters of his given name are transposed or omitted in part or altogether on the ballot, the vote for such candidate shall be counted for him if the intention of the elector to vote for him is apparent. Ballots not counted shall be marked "defective" on the back thereof and shall be preserved for such time as is provided in section 31-10-616 for ballots and destroyed as therein directed.

     <p>
      In municipalities using paper ballots, the clerk shall cause to be printed and distributed to the election judges in the respective precincts a sufficient number of ballots. The ballots shall be sent in one or more sealed packages for each precinct with marks on the outside of each clearly stating the precinct and polling place for which it is intended, together with the number of ballots enclosed. Such packages shall be delivered to one of the judges of election of such precinct between the close of business on the Friday preceding election day or during any earlier day in which a judges' school of instruction is held, and 8 p.m. on the Monday before election day. A receipt for the ballots thus delivered shall be given by the election judge who receives them. The receipt shall be filed with the clerk, who shall also keep a record of the time when and the manner in which each of said packages was sent and delivered. The election judge receiving such package shall produce the same, with the seal unbroken, in the proper polling place at the opening of the polls on election day and, in the presence of all election judges for the precinct, shall open the package.

      If the ballots to be furnished to any election judge are not delivered by 8 p.m. on the Monday before election day or if after delivery they are destroyed or stolen, the clerk shall cause other ballots to be prepared, as nearly in the form prescribed as practicable, with the word "substitute" printed in brackets immediately under the facsimile signature of the clerk. Upon receipt of ballots thus prepared, accompanied by a written and sworn statement of the clerk that the same have been so prepared and furnished by him and that the original ballots have so failed to be received or have been destroyed or stolen, the election judges shall cause the ballots so substituted to be used at the election. If from any cause none of the official ballots or substitute ballots prepared by the clerk are ready for distribution at any polling place or if the supply of ballots is exhausted before the polls are closed, unofficial ballots, printed or written, made as nearly as possible in the form of the official ballots, may be used until substitutes prepared by the clerk are printed and delivered.

       </b>
       The general rule is that absentee voter statutes should be strictly construed, and that the voter who wishes to cast an absentee ballot must comply with all the statutory requirements. City of Aspen v. Howell, 170 Colo. 82, 459 P.2d 764 (1969).

        Absentee ballot authorized in annexation election.
       </b>
       Since the general assembly intended to make the municipal election code, which expressly provides for absentee ballots, applicable generally to municipal elections, and since the municipal election code provides that the municipal election code should be construed liberally so that all legally qualified electors may be permitted to vote, we hold that the municipal election code by its terms authorized the absentee ballots in an annexation election.

Any recount conducted pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be completed no later than the fifteenth day following the election and shall be paid for by the governing body. The clerk shall give notice of the recount to all candidates and, in the case of a ballot issue or question, to any petition representatives identified pursuant to sections 31-2-221 (1), 31-4-502 (1)(a)(I), and 31-11-106 (2) that are affected by the result of the election.

This request shall be filed with the clerk within ten days after the election. Before conducting the recount, the clerk shall give notice of the recount in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, shall determine the cost of the recount, shall notify the interested party that requested the recount of such cost, and shall collect the cost of conducting the recount from such interested party. The interested party that requested the recount shall pay on demand the cost of the recount to the clerk.

       This type of incorporation results in a duplication of government facilities, frustrates area-wide coordination and uniformity of regulations, complicates government structure, often circumvents legitimate zoning controls, frequently leads to an avoidance of city tax burdens, and thus causes an inequitable distribution of the costs of municipal services.

       No unincorporated area may be annexed to a municipality unless one of the conditions set forth in section 30 (1) of article II of the state constitution first has been met. An area is eligible for annexation if the provisions of section 30 of article II of the state constitution have been complied with and the governing body, at a hearing as provided in section 31-12-109, finds and determines:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t31a12p01s31-12-104ol11a">
         That not less than one-sixth of the perimeter of the area proposed to be annexed is contiguous with the annexing municipality. Contiguity shall not be affected by the existence of a platted street or alley, a public or private right-of-way, a public or private transportation right-of-way or area, public lands, whether owned by the state, the United States, or an agency thereof, except county-owned open space, or a lake, reservoir, stream, or other natural or artificial waterway between the annexing municipality and the land proposed to be annexed. Subject to the requirements imposed by section 31-12-105 (1)(e), contiguity may be established by the annexation of one or more parcels in a series, which annexations may be completed simultaneously and considered together for the purposes of the public hearing required by sections 31-12-108 and 31-12-109 and the annexation impact report required by section 31-12-108.5.
        </li>
        <li id="t31a12p01s31-12-104ol11b">
         That a community of interest exists between the area proposed to be annexed and the annexing municipality; that said area is urban or will be urbanized in the near future; and that said area is integrated with or is capable of being integrated with the annexing municipality. The fact that the area proposed to be annexed has the contiguity with the annexing municipality required by paragraph (a) of this subsection (1) shall be a basis for a finding of compliance with these requirements unless the governing body, upon the basis of competent evidence presented at the hearing provided for in section 31-12-109, finds that at least two of the following are shown to exist:
         <ol type="I">
          <li id="t31a12p01s31-12-104ol11bI">
           Less than fifty percent of the adult residents of the area proposed to be annexed make use of part or all of the following types of facilities of the annexing municipality: Recreational, civic, social, religious, industrial, or commercial; and less than twenty-five percent of said area's adult residents are employed in the annexing municipality. If there are no adult residents at the time of the hearing, this standard shall not apply.

           One-half or more of the land in the area proposed to be annexed (including streets) is agricultural, and the landowners of such agricultural land, under oath, express an intention to devote the land to such agricultural use for a period of not less than five years.

          <li id="t31a12p01s31-12-104ol11bIII">
           It is not physically practicable to extend to the area proposed to be annexed those urban services which the annexing municipality provides in common to all of its citizens on the same terms and conditions as such services are made available to such citizens. This standard shall not apply to the extent that any portion of an area proposed to be annexed is provided or will within the reasonably near future be provided with any service by or through a quasi-municipal corporation.

         The contiguity required by paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section may not be established by use of any boundary of an area which was previously annexed to the annexing municipality if the area, at the time of its annexation, was not contiguous at any point with the boundary of the annexing municipality, was not otherwise in compliance with paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section, and was located more than three miles from the nearest boundary of the annexing municipality, nor may such contiguity be established by use of any boundary of territory which is subsequently annexed directly to, or which is indirectly connected through subsequent annexations to, such an area.

         Because the creation or expansion of disconnected municipal satellites, which are sought to be prohibited by this subsection (2), violates both the purposes of this article as expressed in section 31-12-102 and the limitations of this article, any annexation which uses any boundary in violation of this subsection (2) may be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void ab initio in addition to other remedies which may be provided. The provisions of section 31-12-116 (2) and (4) and section 31-12-117 shall not apply to such an annexation. Judicial review of such an annexation may be sought by any municipality having a plan in place pursuant to section 31-12-105 (1)(e) directly affected by such annexation, in addition to those described in section 31-12-116 (1). Such review may be, but need not be, instituted prior to the effective date of the annexing ordinance and may include injunctive relief. Such review shall be brought no later than sixty days after the effective date of the annexing ordinance or shall forever be barred.

       Rather, interpretation of subsection (1) is a question of law for the courts to decide, and judicial review is therefore de novo. Accordingly, in determining whether the roadways at issue are open space for purposes of subsection (1)(a), the county's designation is not binding. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City of Aurora, 62 P.3d 1049 (Colo. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property at issue designated by the county has been improved through grading and surfacing and serves as public roadways. A parcel consisting entirely of roadway is not "essentially unimproved" and, therefore, is not open space within the meaning of subsection (1)(a). Because the county roads here are not open space, they do not affect contiguity under the terms of this section. Hence, the court erred in voiding the annexation of the two parcels for failure to satisfy the contiguity requirement. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City of Aurora, 62 P.3d 1049 (Colo. App. 2002).

        Municipal annexation of property does not automatically remove property from all other political subdivisions.

       Municipal annexation of property detaches the property from the unincorporated portion of a county but does not automatically remove the property from other political subdivisions, particularly where other statutory provisions govern such removal. Municipal annexation of property within the boundaries of a regional transportation authority therefore does not remove the property from the authority and the authority may continue to levy its sales tax on taxable transactions conducted on the property.

        </b>
        Only if there is such a tract as would affect the establishment of the boundaries, i.e., the outer perimeters of the area to be annexed, does this statute cause the annexation proceedings to terminate; if the boundaries of the annexed area are not affected, the excluded tracts of 20 acres or more are not to be included in the annexed territory, but the annexation continues.

         IV. ANNEXATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICT'S LAND.

       <p>
        <b>
         Legislative intent.
        </b>
        In enacting subsection (1)(d) of this section, the general assembly intended to empower school boards to protect themselves against having involuntarily to undertake responsibility for providing educational services in newly annexed areas. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City &amp; County of Denver, 193 Colo. 211, 565 P.2d 212 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Formal written consent required.
        </b>
        This section explicitly requires, in annexation involving school property, "the written consent of the board of education" of the school district involved, and faced with the clear mandate of the statute, we are not at liberty to hold that, in some cases, the giving of the required consent is but a ministerial act, not requiring formal action by the board. Gavend v. City of Thornton, 165 Colo. 182, 437 P.2d 778 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Ordinance invalid due to lack of consent.
        </b>
        Where on the date of final passage of the annexation ordinance here, the effective date thereof, no valid written consent of the board of education had been obtained, the ordinance was invalid when passed, and no action or resolution purporting to ratify the superintendent's consent taken by the board of education thereafter could, in and of itself, breathe life into this dead ordinance. Gavend v. City of Thornton, 165 Colo. 182, 437 P.2d 778 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Later ratification invalid.
        </b>
        The school board's resolution consenting to the annexation of its property and ratifying the action of the superintendent in signing the annexation petition does not satisfy the express requirement that the written consent of the school board be obtained before any territory which includes school property can be annexed. Gavend v. City of Thornton, 165 Colo. 182, 437 P.2d 778 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Superintendent's signature insufficient.
        </b>
        The act of the superintendent of schools in signing the annexation petition without prior formal authorization by the school board was not an act of the board, and could not satisfy the requirement that the "written consent of the board of education" be obtained. Gavend v. City of Thornton, 165 Colo. 182, 437 P.2d 778 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         School board consented to the first stage of an annexation by having consented to the entire two-stage transaction.
        </b>

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A school board's resolution was not ineffective on the theory that approval was conditional upon obtaining a particular zoning classification
        </b>
        where the resolution's "whereas" clauses, rather than expressing conditions, recited the factual circumstances as presented to the board and the "resolved" clauses contained the board's unqualified approval of the annexation. City &amp; County of Denver v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 191 Colo. 104, 550 P.2d 862 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Substantial compliance with requirements that documents accompany petition.
        </b>
        Where, in its resolution, the city council recited that the annexation petition was accompanied by a map and school board resolution, and these documents were available on file with the Denver clerk and recorder for the city council's inspection and consideration prior to passage of the annexation ordinance, there was substantial compliance with the requirements that the documents accompany the petition. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City &amp; County of Denver, 193 Colo. 325, 566 P.2d 335 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the resolution of a city's school board was not attached to the petition for annexation pursuant to subsection (1)(d), this defect was of no moment since the resolution was filed with the city clerk and the council could take notice of such information when it was contained within the city's files. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City &amp; County of Denver, 38 Colo. App. 171, 556 P.2d 486 (1976), aff'd, 194 Colo. 252, 571 P.2d 1094 (1977).

       Since § 31-12-106 is similar to former § 31-8-106 prior to the 1975 repeal and reenactment of this title, and laws antecedent thereto, relevant cases construing those provisions have been included in the annotations to this section.

       <b>
        There is not absolute constitutional right under the due process clause to vote on a proposed annexation,
       </b>
       and the state general assembly has the ultimate control of the method of annexing by its agency cities. The general assembly may grant the right to vote in some types of annexation and deny it in others, provided that there is some rational basis for the distinction, and the equal protection clause of the federal constitution does not preclude creation of distinct classes if such classifications are reasonably related to some legitimate state interest and all those within the class created are treated equally. Therefore, within each of the present classes based on the extent of contiguous boundaries all persons residing within the territory to be annexed are treated equally with respect to the right to exercise the franchise, and the distinction recognized by the assembly as to when the franchise may be exercised is reasonable in light of the manifest purpose for the differentiation. Adams v. City of Colo. Springs, 308 F. Supp. 1397 (D. Colo.), aff'd mem., 399 U.S. 901, 90 S. Ct. 2197, 26 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1970).

        Commencement of three-year period.
       </b>
       The intendment of this section is that the area to be annexed need only be contiguous for a three-year period, the commencement of which can be either before or after the act became effective so long as the total time is three years.

        Significance of required two-thirds contiguity.
       </b>
       Where the area to be annexed has less than two-thirds contiguity with the annexing city, the interrelationship between the annexed area and the city may not be great enough to warrant a politically undesirable unilateral merger; where, however, the territory to be annexed has over two-thirds contiguity with the annexing city, the interrelationship between the two areas is or can be so close that the city should be allowed to annex despite the unwillingness of the residents of the annexed territory. The law thus recognizes that a municipality such as Colorado Springs is severely handicapped by an annexation law which requires the approval of the property owners and qualified electors of an annexed area, it being unable to deal with groups of citizens who form small tax colonies on the borders of the core city which is the economic base of the urban area and to which the colonies owe their very existence and yet pay nothing for the advantages which the city provides, as these people would seldom consent to the annexation and their nonconsent would threaten the very existence of the core city. Adams v. City of Colo. Springs, 308 F. Supp. 1397 (D. Colo.), aff'd mem., 399 U.S. 901, 90 S. Ct. 2197, 26 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1970).

        Annexation power is legislative in nature.

       In a unilateral annexation pursuant to subsection (2), the legislative body with annexing authority must make specific findings at a hearing that the proposed area to be annexed has had the requisite boundary contiguity for the requisite period of time before such an area is eligible for annexation by the governing body.

        Railroad rights-of-way do not constitute public rights-of-way

       <b>
        Determination of sole ownership involving street as only contiguous point.
       </b>
       Even though contiguity is not affected by the existence of a street the determination of sole ownership for purpose of annexation under § 31-12-106 (3) is affected by a street owned by an entity other than the annexing authority where that street constitutes the only contiguous land.

       <b>
        Where city owns 50-foot strip in land to be annexed.
       </b>
       Since the city council must decide whether annexation will be approved under § 31-12-107 (1)(g) where owners of 100% of the land to be annexed had signed the petition, no purpose would be served by requiring the city, as owner of a 50-foot contiguous strip in the land to be annexed, to sign a petition addressed to itself. Likewise, to require that since the city has not signed the petition, it must first annex the 50-foot strip pursuant to subsection (3), would be to establish a procedure that does not comport with the legislative mandate that the purpose of the act is to provide for the "orderly growth of urban communities". Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City &amp; County of Denver, 38 Colo. App. 171, 556 P.2d 486 (1976), aff'd, 194 Colo. 252, 571 P.2d 1094 (1977).

      <p>
       <b>
        County-owned street may be used as "pole".
       </b>
       It is not permissible to include and use a county street as the "pole" in order to meet the § 31-12-104 (1) contiguity requirement, but to ignore the county ownership of the street for purposes of meeting the subsection (3) sole ownership requirement in a city annexation ordinance.

        The general assembly clearly intended to distinguish between petitions for annexation signed by 100 percent of the owners of the land proposed for annexation and petitions signed by a lesser number by enacting this section.

       <p>
        <b>
         Initiation of proceedings by petition.
        </b>
        This section provides that annexation proceedings of eligible territory shall be initiated by written petition presented to the legislative body of the city, city and county, or incorporated town to which it is proposed to annex such territory. People ex rel. City &amp; County of Denver v. County Court, 137 Colo. 436, 326 P.2d 372 (1958); City of Englewood v. Daily, 158 Colo. 356, 407 P.2d 325 (1965).

       <p>
        <b>
         Land ownership and tax liability proponent and opponent prerequisites.
        </b>
        The requirements of ownership in fee and the liability for taxes were both prerequisites for participation as a proponent of the annexation, and the same requirements confronted an opponent of the annexation. City &amp; County of Denver v. Holmes, 156 Colo. 586, 400 P.2d 901 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Owners of land in joint tenancy are entitled to sign
        </b>
        and to be counted with the resident landowners, because each joint tenant owns an interest and is in his own right a landowner. Rice v. City of Englewood, 147 Colo. 33, 362 P.2d 557 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Petition signed by executor.
        </b>
        The petition for annexation was signed by the "owner" of 100 percent of the territory annexed where it was signed by an executor to whom was given full power to manage and sell estate property as well as authority to do any act or carry out any agreement respecting the property even though title was not in him. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City &amp; County of Denver, 193 Colo. 211, 565 P.2d 212 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where an annexation petition was signed by a tenant-in-common holding an undivided interest
        </b>
        in the land annexed, the requirements of subsection (1)(g) were met and no notice, hearing, or election was necessary. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City &amp; County of Denver, 193 Colo. 325, 566 P.2d 335 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Where signers of the annexation petition owned well over 50% of the land proposed to be annexed,
        </b>
        but at the same time five of the nine resident signers were favorable to the annexation, the fact that these resident owners represented a percentage of property less than 50% is inconsequential since much more than 50% of the area was represented by resident and nonresident owners. Rice v. City of Englewood, 147 Colo. 33, 362 P.2d 557 (1961).
       </p>

       <p>
        <b>
         Streets and roadways are excluded
        </b>
        when considering whether all of the landowners in an area proposed to be annexed have signed an annexation petition, and, if all other owners are signatories, there are no notice, hearing, or election requirements.

         Immaterial who obtains consent.

         III. PETITION FOR ANNEXATION ELECTION.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         This section provides for the electorate to have a veto power
        </b>
        over annexation when it commands that an election petition take precedence over any petition filed with city council by petitioners who own more than 50% of the land. Breternitz v. City of Arvada, 174 Colo. 56, 482 P.2d 955 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Compliance with subsection (1)(c)(III) not required.
        </b>
        When a petition for annexation election if filed pursuant to subsection (2), the signers, if they comprise the requisite number or percentage and are qualified electors and resident landowners in the territory, need not also comply with subsection (1)(c)(II). Breternitz v. City of Arvada, 174 Colo. 56, 482 P.2d 955 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general assembly intended that subsection (1)(c)(III) of this section requiring signatures of more than 50% of the landowners be excepted, i.e., "taken out" and excluded from consideration when the requisite number of petitioners sought annexation by the election alternative. Breternitz v. City of Arvada, 174 Colo. 56, 482 P.2d 955 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the provision of subsection (2) that either 75 electors or 10%, whichever is the lesser, can petition for an election in which the majority vote will control, it simply does not make sense to add the additional requirement that these same petitioners be owners of more than 50% of the land. Breternitz v. City of Arvada, 174 Colo. 56, 482 P.2d 955 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Corporate or nonresident owners have no voice in election.
        </b>
        Subsection (2), if it is to be given life and meaning, was intended to provide for a voice in the annexation process to be given to people living in the area as opposed to corporate or nonresident owners of larger segments of the land. Breternitz v. City of Arvada, 174 Colo. 56, 482 P.2d 955 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Except corporate owner may petition.
        </b>
        By giving full force and effect to the subsection (2) alternative, one corporate owner, or two, or half a dozen owners of more than 50% of the land cannot impose their annexation whims on other resident-electors who own the balance or less than 50% of the territory, but the latter may nevertheless petition for an election if 75 electors or 10% wish to put the matter to a vote. Breternitz v. City of Arvada, 174 Colo. 56, 482 P.2d 955 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Suspension of actions on annexation petition.
        </b>
        The provision that a petition for annexation election shall take precedence over an annexation petition does not require that, when the election petition was filed, all actions under the annexation petition should have been abandoned, and a new procedure should have been initiated under subsection (2). City of Aspen v. Howell, 170 Colo. 82, 459 P.2d 764 (1969).

        <b>
         Findings as to qualifications of signers proper.
        </b>
        Where there was testimony that the signers of the petition were registered voters, that each signer stated under oath that he was a landowner, and that an examination of the county records disclosed them all to be landowners, and the petition recited that the signers were qualified electors, residents in and landowners of the area proposed to be annexed, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that less than 75 of the signers were not qualified to sign, the finding of the city council as to the qualifications of the signers is proper.

        The regional transportation district (RTD) and the Douglas county soil conservation district (DCSCD) are not special districts to whom notice of the annexation hearing must be given under subsection (2).
       </b>
       Subsection (2) requires, among other things, that the annexing municipality provide notice of the annexation hearing to any special district having territory within the area to be annexed. For purposes of this subsection, a "special district" means any quasi-municipal corporation and political subdivision organized or acting pursuant to the provisions of the Special District Act, article 1 of title 32. Here, RTD and DCSCD were not created and do not act pursuant to the Special District Act. Rather, each was created and operates pursuant to its own enabling legislation. Such legislation refers to both entities as "districts" but not "special districts". Accordingly, the district court incorrectly voided the annexation because of the city's failure to give notice to these districts. Bd. of County Comm'rs v. City of Aurora, 62 P.3d 1049 (Colo.

       In a unilateral annexation pursuant to § 31-12-106 (2), the legislative body with annexing authority must make specific findings at a hearing that the proposed area to be annexed has had the requisite boundary contiguity for the requisite period of time before such an area is eligible for annexation by the governing body.

        Election code applicable.

      </p>

       The municipal election code applies to elections under the annexation act to the extent that its terms are not inconsistent with the specific provisions of the annexation act. City of Aspen v. Howell, 170 Colo. 82, 459 P.2d 764 (1969).

       <b>
        Nonresident landowner may vote.
       </b>
       In view of the specific provision in subsection (2) that a landowner may vote irrespective of whether he is a qualified elector, which entails residency, and the further recognition in subsection (5) that qualified electors and landowners may be two separate groups, both entitled to vote, the supreme court concludes that the general assembly intended to permit a nonresident landowner to vote in an annexation election, because the specific provisions must be held to prevail over the general provisions, and to the extent that this construction conflicts with the residency requirements of the municipal election code, those provisions are held to be superseded by the provisions of the annexation act. City of Aspen v. Howell, 170 Colo. 82, 459 P.2d 764 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Absentee ballots authorized.
       </b>
       Since the municipal election code provides that such code should be construed liberally so that all legally qualified electors may be permitted to vote, we hold that the municipal election code by its terms authorized the absentee ballots in an annexation election. City of Aspen v. Howell, 170 Colo. 82, 459 P.2d 764 (1969).

        Preexisting ordinances do not impose additional terms and conditions

        Filing requirements of subsection (2)(a)(II)(A) and § 24-32-109 not satisfied by mere substantial compliance.
       </b>
       There are several clear indications in these statutory provisions that substantial compliance with filing requirements is insufficient. Both statutes plainly declare that the consequence of noncompliance is that annexation shall not become effective. Unlike statutes governing annexations by petition, this section and § 24-32-109 do not expressly allow for substantial compliance. Presence of an explicit good cause exception in subsection (2)(c) suggests general assembly intended that only a showing of good cause would excuse strict compliance. Grandote Golf &amp; Ctry.

      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming that substantial compliance with this section and the requirements of § 24-32-109 may render an annexation effective, there was no substantial compliance with additional requirement that a certified copy of the annexation ordinance and map be filed with division of local government. This requirement cannot be deemed a mere formality; excusing noncompliance with this requirement would not result in fulfillment of the relevant statutes' purposes. Grandote Golf &amp; Ctry. Club v. Town of La Veta, 252 P.3d 1196 (Colo. App. 2011).

       Because required filings of annexation ordinance did not occur, and because no good cause was shown (or even alleged for the failure), the annexation contemplated by the ordinance did not become effective. Grandote Golf &amp; Ctry. Club v. Town of La Veta, 252 P.3d 1196 (Colo. App. 2011).

        Simultaneous passage of zoning and annexation ordinances.

        A county building permit obtained prior to the involuntary annexation ordinance does not preclude the rezoning made by the city,

       Since § 31-12-308 is similar to former § 31-8-206 prior to the 1975 repeal and reenactment of this title, and laws antecedent thereto, a relevant case construing a prior provision has been included in the annotations to this section.

        Judicial proceedings.
       </b>
       That the section does not expressly require the court's approval of the report of the annexation proceedings to be in writing does not militate at all against the view that the proceedings before the court are judicial. Martin v. Simpkins, 20 Colo. 438, 38 P. 1092 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The effect which this section gives to the approval of the report is, in every respect, a most important judgment,
       </b>
       because it is a judgment which dissolves a municipal corporation, deprives it of its franchises, annexes its territory to another municipality, and which may subject its inhabitants to increased taxation and other additional municipal burdens. Martin v. Simpkins, 20 Colo. 438, 38 P. 1092 (1895).

        Citizens' and taxpayers' standing.

       Resident citizens and taxpayers of a municipality who sought to be annexed to another under this section, have such an interest in the subject matter of the annexation proceedings that they are entitled to a writ of error from the supreme court to review the judgment of the district court approving such proceedings. Martin v. Simpkins, 20 Colo. 438, 38 P. 1092 (1895).

      If any actions, suits, or proceedings are pending against any one of the cities or towns at the time of the consolidation, the consolidated city or town shall be substituted as plaintiff or defendant in such action, suit, or proceeding. The same shall thenceforth proceed as if the claim, right, debt, or demand upon which said action, suit, or proceeding was founded had originally existed in favor of or against such consolidated town or city. In like manner, any person who, at the date of consolidation, has any claim, demand, or right of action against any one or more of the cities or towns so consolidating may bring any action, suit, or proceeding necessary for the collection or enforcement thereof after such consolidation against the consolidated city or town in the same manner as though the claim, demand, or right of action had originally existed against such consolidated city or town. In no case shall any tax be levied upon or liability incurred by any property or persons on account of such actions, suits, proceedings, debts, liabilities, or rights of action, except those persons and property which would have been liable for the same in case no consolidation had taken place. The governing body of the consolidated city or town has the power to levy a special tax upon persons and property within the former limits of the city or town against which such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, or right of action existed for the payment, liquidation, or settlement thereof or of any judgment founded thereon. The terms of consolidation may make other provisions for the payment of such demands, liabilities, and judgments.

        Change in form of debt inconsequential.
       </b>
       The plaintiff contends that this section is so worded that the change of the form of the indebtedness precludes a taxation of the disconnected land that otherwise was within the contemplation of the section. What possible bearing the change in form of the debt would have, we are unable to conceive. The section says that the disconnected lands shall not be exempt from taxes for the purposes of paying any indebtedness lawfully contracted while the lands are within the limits of the town. The indebtedness now evidenced by the refunding bonds, was contracted while plaintiff's land was within these limits, and it makes no difference that the original form of the debt has been changed into a judgment, then into funding, and then into refunding, bonds. Town of Aurora v. Watkins, 77 Colo. 234, 236 P. 556 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the purchasers of the original bond issue acquired the water bonds the law was, and the bonds so stated, that all the property within the limits of the town was subject to taxation for raising a fund to pay the bonded debt, and even had the general assembly explicitly enacted a disconnecting statute that property within the town when the debt was contracted shall, after disconnection, be exempt from taxation for the purpose of paying the bonded debt, the act would be unconstitutional.

      Upon the filing of such petition in the district court, the judge shall set a date for a hearing, not less than forty days nor more than sixty days thereafter. The clerk of the court shall serve a copy of the petition and a notice of the date and the time set for such hearing upon the mayor of the town.

Upon the hearing and proof of the facts set forth in such petition, the court shall determine whether the tracts of land should be disconnected from the town, and the judge shall enter an order or decree accordingly. When a town has improved any of the highways passing through or adjoining said tracts of land by the construction and maintenance by the town of any special improvements along, under, or over the same for a period of more than two years prior to the presentation of the petition, the petitioners are not entitled to disconnect the land under the provisions of this part 7. Any disconnected land shall be made subject to the applicable county's zoning resolution and map and other land development regulations within ninety days after the effective date of the disconnection as described in section 31-12-501 (5).

        Rule not of symmetry but of contiguity.
       </b>
       Although the supreme court has held that no disconnection of land can be upheld which divides a town into two areas wholly isolated from each other, where the creation of a "corridor" has the effect of making the town's boundaries somewhat irregular, but, the area concerned remains contiguous to the rest of the town with the same access to all parts of the town as existed before the disconnection, it is not wholly isolated, the rule is not one of symmetry, but of contiguity.

      When the governing body of such town levies a tax upon the property within such town for the purpose of paying such indebtedness or any part thereof and interest thereon, such governing body shall have the authority to levy a tax at the same rate and for the same purpose on the land so disconnected. The county treasurer shall pay over to such town all moneys collected by him on account of such tax, to be applied only to the payment of such indebtedness. In case the owner of any land so disconnected pays off and discharges a portion of such indebtedness equal in amount to the same proportion of the indebtedness which the valuation for assessment of his land bears to the entire valuation for assessment of all the property subject to taxation for the payment of such indebtedness, calculated according to the last assessment previous to such payment, said land shall be exempted from further taxation to pay such indebtedness. Upon such payment being made, the canceled bonds or other evidences of payment of such portion of said indebtedness shall be deposited with the treasurer of such town, and a certificate shall be given by him stating that such payment has been made.

        Public necessity a state and municipal legislative determination.
       </b>
       Whether the recital in a municipal ordinance, what it is "necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety", is true or not is a legislative and not a judicial question, and respecting this matter, there is no distinction between state and municipal legislation.

        Standard measuring exercise of police power.
       </b>
       If a restriction upon the use of property is to be upheld as a valid exercise of the police power it must bear "a fair relation to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare", and have "a definite tendency to promote or protect the same". In determining the validity of restraints upon freedom imposed by statute or ordinance, the determination to be made is whether the ordinance has a real and substantial relation to the accomplishment of those objectives which form the basis of police regulation. City of Colo. Springs v. Grueskin, 161 Colo. 281, 422 P.2d 384 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process, as it applies to cases involving municipal trash ordinances, requires only that a municipal ordinance enacted under the police power shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and that it bear a rational relation to a proper legislative object sought to be attained. United States Disposal Sys. v. City of Northglenn, 193 Colo. 277, 567 P.2d 365 (1977).
      </p>

       A municipal regulation having a fair relation to the protection of human life and the protection of public convenience and welfare constitutes a reasonable application of the police power. United States Disposal Sys. v. City of Northglenn, 193 Colo. 277, 567 P.2d 365 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The standard for determining whether there is a rational basis to uphold the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance is whether the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate governmental goal. City of Leadville v. Rood, 198 Colo. 328, 600 P.2d 62 (1979).

        An ordinance comports with due process when it bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.
       </b>
       Municipal ordinances for road improvement project that eliminated parking on the municipality's right-of-way near a condominium were a reasonable exercise of the municipality's police powers. The ordinances were within the municipality's police power to regulate matters of public health, safety, and welfare. The measures were a reasonable exercise of that power because they were reasonably related to the municipality's objectives of improving traffic safety, improving water drainage, and remedying a missing portion of a recreational bike path. In examining the reasonableness of the relationship, a court does not compare or otherwise examine alternative methods for addressing the government objective. Town of Dillon v. Yacht Club Condo. Assn., 2014 CO 37, 325 P.3d 1032.

        U.S. supreme court's contemporary regulatory takings jurisprudence makes clear that the relevant inquiries for due process and takings claims are distinct.

       Because the property owner did not (and could not) assert a takings claim, the lower courts' focus on the magnitude and character of the burden imposed on the property owner by the ordinance was misplaced. Town of Dillon v. Yacht Club Condo. Assn., 2014 CO 37, 325 P.3d 1032.

        Finding city standard unreasonable.
       </b>
       It is not for the supreme court to substitute its notions as to what is fair and reasonable, but to ascertain under all existing circumstances whether the standard established by the city is in fact reasonable and bears a reasonable relation to the public health, welfare, and safety of the city and its inhabitants. And while it might be desirable to classify service stations as to the capacity of the truck which may make delivery there, or to promulgate some other reasonable regulations applying to retail services stations based on their specific location in certain fire zones, the supreme court held that an ordinance which requires the tank vehicles to pass through the city to a bulk plant, unload at the bulk plant, and then reload vehicles and a capacity of less than 2,200 gallons for redelivery to retail filling stations throughout the city, necessarily involves a greater exposure to hazard and accident, and therefore a greater danger to the public health, welfare, and safety of the city and its populace.

       Where an ordinance enumerating many places where men usually assemble or pass, provided that no person "shall drink" certain designated intoxicating liquors, while in any of these places "unless the person occupying the building be duly licensed by the city to sell, etc.", it was held that the manifest purpose of the ordinance is to prevent the drinking of intoxicating liquors in public view, and particularly of children and youth, and thus improve the public morals; that including all of the places of the classes designated it is therefore authorized by this section.

        The general rules are that where authority to exercise a corporate power by ordinance is granted, an attempt to exercise it by resolution is futile, and that where the constitution or this section which permits or grants the right to exercise a corporate power expressly designates the way in which it may be exercised, such designation limits the right to exercise it to the way specified, and renders its attempted exercise in any other way ineffectual.

         Statutory recital creates justified reliance by purchasers.

        Recital in municipal bonds that they were issued in accordance with the provisions of the enabling statute imports that they were sent forth in pursuant of a lawful and proper resolution or ordinance and of just and proper action by the governing board of a municipality. Such relieves the innocent purchaser of all inquiry, notice, or knowledge of the record, action, or omission of the municipal board or council or of the other officers of the municipality, and estops the municipality from denying that a lawful resolution or ordinance was passed and proper action was taken.

        A municipality, a quasi-municipality, or a corporation and its officers, who by the apparent legality of their obligations or by recitals of their validity have induced innocent purchasers to invest in them are estopped from denying their legality on the ground that in some of the preliminary proceedings which led to their execution, or in their execution itself, they failed to comply with some law or rule of action relative to the mere time or manner of action relative to the mere time or manner of their procedure, with which they might have lawfully complied, but which they carelessly disregarded. Hayden v. Town of Aurora, 57 Colo. 389, 142 P. 183 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        A municipality or a quasi-municipality may not, by the recital of certificates in its bonds, estop itself from denying that it is without power to issue them when the laws are such that there can be no state of facts or of circumstances under which it would have authority to emit them.

         Authority to issue bonds to purchase water rights.
        </b>
        Subsection (1)(d) empowers towns and cities to contract an indebtedness for the purpose of purchasing or constructing waterworks for fire and domestic purposes and for the purpose of constructing or purchasing canals or some suitable system of supplying water for irrigation. When considered in connection with §§ 31-15-708 (1)(a) and (1)(b) and 31-15-707 (1)(e), relating to the condemnation of property, the power to construct and purchase reservoirs, to provide pumps, conducting pipes and ditches, to take water from the public streams, and to purchase water and water rights, it gives authority to such municipalities to issue bonds for the purchase of water rights to secure water for its inhabitants.

        Where the court ruled that the money was not for the purpose of purchasing of constructing waterworks, but that such waterworks had already been authorized and the city legislative body found the indebtedness necessary to supply the city with water, it was said that to render the waterworks effective so as to supply the city with water does not require constant submission to the voters for every improvement necessary to handle the water supply.

         Scope of power.
        </b>
        Subsection (1)(e) shows a deliberate intention to invest the city council with ample power over the subject of municipal improvements, not only by means of general and special taxes, but also by means of special charges or assessments, in all cases where the same are applicable and allowable by the constitution and laws of the state, and to authorize the collection thereof by suit in court, or by the county treasurer, in the same manner as other delinquent taxes are collected. City of Pueblo v. Robinson, 12 Colo. 593, 21 P. 899 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Authorized for purposes other than gas or water rents.
        </b>
        The provisions of subsection (1)(e) stating that "In any such proceedings, where pleadings are required, it shall be sufficient to declare generally for work and labor done and materials furnished on the particular street, alley or highway, or for water rent or gas used" plainly shows that it was the design of this subdivision to authorize special assessments for other purposes than gas or water rents. City of Pueblo v. Robinson, 12 Colo. 593, 21 P. 899 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Apportionment authorized.
        </b>
        In cases where special assessments are authorized, the city council may prescribe the rule of apportionment, having reference to the special benefits accruing to the property by reason of the improvement, the same to be such as will secure an assessment in proportion to the benefits accruing as nearly as practicable. City of Pueblo v. Robinson, 12 Colo. 593, 21 P. 899 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Mode of assessment proper.
        </b>
        When the property consists of lots of substantially equal depth abutting the local improvement, and there is nothing in the nature and circumstances of the particular case showing that an assessment in proportion to the frontage of the lots upon the improvement would work manifest injustice, such a mode of assessment should be upheld. City of Pueblo v. Robinson, 12 Colo. 593, 21 P. 899 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Authority for lien must be by ordinance.
        </b>
        A municipal corporation cannot acquire a lien on town lots for unpaid water assessments unless and until the adoption of an ordinance authorizing such a lien under this subdivision. Ordway v. Kaiser, 90 Colo. 313, 9 P.2d 287 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Foreclosure of a trust deed cuts out all junior liens, including statutory liens, unless these be specifically excluded, hence the lien of a municipality for water assessments authorized under subsection (1)(e) is not superior to that of a trust deed on the property affected unless it attached under appropriate ordinance prior to the recording of the trust deed.

         Constitutionality of conferring discretionary power of enforcement.
        </b>
        The conferring of discretionary power upon administrative boards to grant or withhold permission to carry on a trade or business which is the proper subject of regulation within the police power of the state is not violative of rights secured by the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution, and where the marshal was the agent of the city government when he issued the citation and impounded the steers, the ordinance is valid, and the execution thereof is strict compliance with its abatement provision is not within the ambit of the civil rights act.

        Where the title indicated that the ordinance defined nuisances and provided for the abatement, removal, or suppression of the same, and paragraph (c) authorizes municipalities under the police power section to declare what shall be a nuisance and to abate the same, accordingly, legislative authority existed for enacting the ordinance under the police power delegated by the state legislative body to the municipality.

         But not outside boundaries.
        </b>
        Assuming, under subsection (1)(c), a town has power to declare it a nuisance for one to sell or keep for sale intoxicating liquor inside the corporate limits, and, by ordinance regulating the procedure, to abate the nuisance, this does not confer power to declare what shall constitute a nuisance within a mile beyond the outer boundaries, and abate it.

         Denoting nuisance insufficient unless city had power to punish conduct.

        The fact that a municipal ordinance which prohibits the solicitation of orders for merchandise from residents without invitation denominates such practice a nuisance, which it may not be in fact, is immaterial in a consideration of the validity of the ordinance, the real question being whether the city had power to punish the prescribed conduct, not whether it had the right to name it.

        The attempt of a city council, by ordinance, to prevent the prosecution of lawful business avocations, not declared by any ordinance to be nuisances, within the city limits without a permit or license from the city council is not authorized by subsection (1)(c), and such an ordinance is repugnant to fundamental rights in that it is susceptible of being used to unjustly discriminate between individuals equally worthy and respectable by permitting certain individuals to pursue the avocations mentioned while denying the privilege to other persons of the same class, or by making acts done by one person penal and imposing no penalty for the same act when done under like circumstances by another.

         Animals.

       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinance was a valid nuisance abatement ordinance which lawfully declared maintenance of cattle within the town limits a nuisance and provided for abatement thereof unless a permit allowing such maintenance had been granted. Martin v. King, 417 F.2d 458 (10th Cir. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Liquor.
        </b>
        The mere sale of, or keeping for sale, intoxicating liquors is not a nuisance per se, but the town council may by ordinance declare it a nuisance. Wolfe v. Abbott, 54 Colo. 531, 131 P. 386 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinance prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors within the limits of the city, and declaring that "a place kept for such sale, and the business, and the liquor kept" is a nuisance "to be abated as any other nuisance" is conclusive in its effect, and the provision that the nuisance shall be abated "as any other nuisance" can be held to mean only as any other nuisance may lawfully be abated. Houston v. Walton, 23 Colo. App. 282, 129 P. 263 (1913).

        <b>
         Privies.
        </b>
        Cities may have the power to declare a privy in an established sewer district a nuisance per se, and to abate it, and fine the party suffering it to exist, but the proceeding would have to be under an ordinance based upon the power conferred by the statutes, and the ordinance must provide the manner of abatement.

         Nuisance per accidents.

        Even though zoning regulations permit an act to be done, and the act is being done with reasonable care and skill, the courts may grant relief where it is found that the acts complained of constitute a nuisance per accidents; to hold otherwise would be to state that the legislative body may license a nuisance.

        <b>
         Manner of arrest and destruction unwarranted.
        </b>
        The arrest with unnecessary force of one found in possession of a stock of intoxicating liquors, the destruction of the liquors with other legitimate merchandise, all in a disorderly and tumultuous manner, in disturbance of the peace of the Sabbath day, was not justified by ordinance prohibiting the sale or keeping for sale of such liquors, and declaring that the sale or keeping for sale of such liquors was a nuisance; nor by a vote or resolution of the city council directing the city marshal to seize and bring before the police magistrate all such liquors, with the persons of those found upon the premises.

         Application of subsection (1)(a) to privies.
        </b>
        Subsection (1)(a) gave the city sufficient authority to compel all buildings embraced within the power to connect with the sewer. It also confers ample power to prohibit the keeping of any privy within a sewer district, or within 400 feet of the sewer; but this does not mean the city has power to compel one who does not desire to make the connection to connect an outside or open privy or vault with the sewer. It can prohibit the maintenance and use of the privy, and can fine the keeper and abate the nuisance, if it is a nuisance, and can compel owners of buildings to connect with the sewer. This would seem sufficient power to rid any sewer district of all privies and vaults, and to compel owners to connect all buildings with the sewer. Gault v. City of Ft. Collins, 57 Colo. 324, 142 P. 171 (1914).

         Income and occupation tax differentiated.
        </b>
        An income tax, whether net or gross, bears a direct relation to the income or receipts of a business. An occupation tax bears no such relationship. The latter is a tax upon the very privilege of doing business, and does not fluctuate from month to month depending upon the financial success or sales of the enterprise. Bd. of Trustees v. Foster Lumber Co., 190 Colo. 479, 548 P.2d 1276 (1976).

         A true business or occupational tax is not an income tax nor a tax on real property,

       <p>
        <b>
         The purpose of an occupation tax

         Subsection (1)(g) ordinances constitutional.
        </b>
        The adoption of a municipal ordinance restricting the operations of peddlers and solicitors at private residences is an authorized and reasonable exercise of police powers of the state delegated to municipal legislative bodies; such ordinances do not deprive the parties affected of any right guaranteed by either the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution or provisions of the state fundamental law. McCormick v. City of Montrose, 105 Colo. 493, 99 P.2d 969 (1939).

         And not a burden on interstate commerce.
        </b>
        A restrictive municipal ordinance concerning the operations of peddlers and solicitors is not a regulation of, or burden upon, interstate commerce within the intent and meaning of the interstate commerce clause of the federal constitution.

         No exclusive power to license shows, etc.

        An ordinance passed under the authority of paragraph (g) requiring one peddling artesian water within the city limits to have a license, and giving the city council power to give or withhold such license at its discretion, is void in that it is violative of the fundamental law of the state and nation, because the right to pursue a lawful calling is a natural right, subject only to such restrictions as the legislative authority may impose upon all alike, and it is not dependent upon the will or caprice, or the pleasure or prejudice or discretion of a city council.

       Due process, as it applies to cases involving municipal trash ordinances, requires only that a municipal ordinance enacted under the police power shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that it bear a rational relation to a proper legislative object sought to be attained.

        An ordinance comports with due process when it bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.
       </b>
       Municipal ordinances for road improvement project that eliminated parking on the municipality's right-of-way near a condominium were a reasonable exercise of the municipality's police powers. The ordinances were within the municipality's police power to regulate matters of public health, safety, and welfare. The measures were a reasonable exercise of that power because they were reasonably related to the municipality's objectives of improving traffic safety, improving water drainage, and remedying a missing portion of a recreational bike path.

        U.S. supreme court's contemporary regulatory takings jurisprudence makes clear that the relevant inquiries for due process and takings claims are distinct.

       Because the property owner did not (and could not) assert a takings claim, the lower courts' focus on the magnitude and character of the burden imposed on the property owner by the ordinance was misplaced. Town of Dillon v. Yacht Club Condo. Assn., 2014 CO 37, 325 P.3d 1032.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         Primary object of subsection (1)(a)
        </b>
        is to permit the inhabitants of towns and cities to secure an adequate supply of pure water, a paramount necessity more important than all other public utilities and absolutely necessary for the sustenance of life, the preservation of health, and the protection of property. The general assembly desired to invest the people, who were themselves to bear the burdens of the expense, with every power necessary to supply this imperative want, but the general assembly itself could not determine and fix upon some one invariable mode or manner by which this supply was to be obtained, for the obvious reasons that too many conditions were to be considered; that what would be proper, necessary, and entirely satisfactory at one town would be entirely impracticable in another, and the inhabitants of one municipality might feel perfectly able to supply their own wants, while those of another might feel wholly unable to assume this burden. Thomas v. City of Grand Junction, 13 Colo. App. 80, 56 P. 665 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Scope of city council's powers.
        </b>
        From subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) and § 31-15-708 (1)(a), it will be seen that the city council has had plenary authority to manage and control the water system and all the property of the city, and to distribute and apply its water not only to ordinary municipal uses, but to "irrigation and other purposes". Pikes Peak Power Co. v. City of Colo. Springs, 105 F. 1 (8th Cir. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Discretionary power.
        </b>
        Subsection (1)(a) was intended to vest, and does vest in the authorities of cities and towns, entire discretion as to the use of any and all of the means specified in the statute to supply the city or town with water, and the fact that a city or town has granted to a private party or corporation a franchise to construct waterworks to supply the city or town does not preclude the city or town from afterwards constructing waterworks of its own. Thomas v. City of Grand Junction, 13 Colo. App. 80, 56 P. 665 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Antitrust statute not violated.
        </b>
        City ordinance requiring permit to construct or operate a natural gas pipeline within city was a foreseeable consequence of the power granted municipalities by this section to acquire gas distribution systems and was shielded from antitrust liability under the state action exemption. Sterling Beef Co. v. Ft. Morgan, 810 F.2d 961 (10th Cir. 1987).

         The operation of an electric plant by a town is the performance of a municipal function

       </p>
       <p>
        Although an ordinance granting the right to a private corporation to operate a lighting plant in the city by its terms fails to reserve the right to the city to purchase or condemn the plant, nevertheless, the provision of subsection (1)(a) to that effect will be read into and made a part of the ordinance. Pub. Serv. Co. v. City of Loveland, 79 Colo. 216, 245 P. 493 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Inapplicable to private plants.
        </b>
        Subsection (1)(a) has no application to electric light plants erected by private parties for their own business purposes; it applies only to waterworks, gas works, and electric light works purchased or erected by cities, or build for cities, under contracts with them, by other parties. Pikes Peak Power Co. v. City of Colo. Springs, 105 F. 1 (8th Cir. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not the intention of the general assembly to require the approving vote of the majority of the taxpayers of a city every time its council issued a license to a corporation, partnership, or person to erect or install a gas plant or an electric light plant upon its premises for domestic or business uses. Pikes Peak Power Co. v. City of Colo. Springs, 105 F. 1 (8th Cir. 1910).

         The words "as may be agreed upon" used in subsection (1)(d) refer to the authority contained in subsection (1)(c),
        </b>
        which leaves the amounts to the unrestricted agreement of the parties, and the intention is to provide a method by which the city might discharge its obligation. Grand Junction Water Co. v. City of Grand Junction, 14 Colo. App. 424, 60 P. 196 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The power of a municipality to levy assessments depends on express provision of charter or statute
        </b>
        and the extent to which the power may be exercised is to be determined by the proper construction of such provision. City of Delta v. Lamb, 55 Colo. 483, 136 P. 77 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Reasonable exercise of power to limit compensation required.
        </b>
        The general power of the legislative department to regulate the compensation of a corporation for performing public services, in the absence of a contract regulating it, is subject to the limitation that it must be reasonably exercised, and the reasonableness of the regulation is a proper subject of judicial inquiry; but where the corporation rendering the services and the municipality have mutually agreed upon a method for determining such compensation, and the latter has complied therewith, the former may not insist upon its constitutional rights and disregard the contract without showing the unreasonableness or nonenforceability thereof. Leadville Water Co. v. City of Leadville, 22 Colo. 297, 45 P. 362 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Contract for higher fee valid.
        </b>
        Under subsection (1)(c), authorizing cities and towns to contract with individuals or companies constructing waterworks, to supply said cities or towns with water and to pay therefor such sum as may be agreed upon between the contracting parties, and subsection (1)(d), providing that if such contract is made, such city or town shall levy each year and cause to be collected a special tax sufficient to pay off the amount agreed to be paid for such water supply, not to exceed three mills on the dollar for any one year, the amount that the city or town may contract to pay is not limited by the limit placed on the amount of special tax that may be levied and collected, and a city or town may contract to pay more than the three-mill levy will cover and pay the deficiency from its general revenue. The failure of a city or town to collect for any one or more years a sufficient sum to discharge its obligation for water rents could not extinguish its liability on the contract. Grand Junction Water Co. v. City of Grand Junction, 14 Colo. App. 424, 60 P. 196 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Amount of levy to pay back rents.
        </b>
        Under subsection (1)(d), where a city is indebted to a water company for back rents and no levy has been made for several years to meet such rents, the city may levy a tax to pay such rents in excess of 3 mills provided the levy is not in excess of 3 mills for each year for which no levy was made. Bowen v. West, 10 Colo. App. 322, 50 P. 1085 (1897).

        <b>
         Statute of limitations.
        </b>
        If an ordinance of a city whereby a water company was permitted to lay water mains on condition that the citizens of the city be permitted to make connections with the mains for domestic supply of water at the prevailing scheduled rates in another city created a perpetual term and was a municipal franchise agreement, the city was foreclosed by virtue of subsection (1)(c) from asserting its rights, more than 25 years after the passage of the ordinance, against the other city, successor to the properties of the water company.

         Discretionary power conclusive.
        </b>
        Under subsection (1)(e) the exercise of discretionary power and judgment of municipal officers, when acting within the scope of their authority, is conclusive unless it clearly appears their action was fraudulent or unreasonable. Lavelle v. Town of Julesburg, 49 Colo. 290, 112 P. 774 (1910); Pub. Serv. Co. v. City of Loveland, 79 Colo. 216, 245 P. 493 (1926).

        </b>
        There is no authority extended to the city, in either subsection (1)(d) or § 38-1-102, to condemn property dedicated to public use. Both statutes relate to private property, and the authority given under subsection (1)(d) to cities and towns for condemnation for private property is regulated by the laws prescribed for the condemnation for real estate, which is clearly and unmistakably set out in § 38-1-102.

        Exercise of legislative police power.
       </b>
       A city council, in establishing a sewer district, exercises a legislative power for police purposes, having its origin in the taxing power. Wolff v. City of Denver, 20 Colo. App. 135, 77 P. 364 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (1)(a) limits the powers of municipal corporations in relation to sewers to those expressed in said paragraph
       </b>
       and an ordinance purporting to grant to a private person an exclusive right and privilege to construct and operate a system of sewers within the limits of a municipal corporation and to collect from all persons using the same a reasonable annual compensation for connecting therewith is absolutely void, and one constructing a sewer system under such ordinance cannot maintain an action against an inhabitant of the city for the use of the same. Weaver v. Canon Sewer Co., 18 Colo. App. 242, 70 P. 953 (1902).
      </p>

        Ownership and control of sewers, except in the municipality, would be inconsistent with the terms of subsection (1)(a).

       <b>
        Judgment of city council conclusive.
       </b>
       The judgment of the city council as to the extent of a sewer district and the properties to be included therein, when acting within the scope of the authority conferred by subsection (1)(a), is conclusive, unless it clearly appears that their action was fraudulent or unreasonable, and whoever assails the action of the city council has the burden of proof. Hildreth v. City of Longmont, 47 Colo. 79, 105 P. 107 (1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Power to subject outside lands to eminent domain not implied.
       </b>
       Under subsection (1)(a), the giving of the right to construct sewers does not also grant authority to subject outside lands to the operation of eminent domain, because such power is not implied because there is nothing in out statutes to even indicate, much less imply, such purpose. Mack v. Town of Craig, 68 Colo. 337, 191 P. 101 (1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (1)(b) delegates to the city four general powers:
       </b>
       First, to establish a sewer system and divide the city into sewer districts; second, to compel owners of buildings in a sewer district, or within 400 feet of a sewer, to connect with the sewer; third, to prohibit privies within a sewer district; and fourth, to regulate, within the city limits, privies not within a sewer district. Gault v. City of Ft. Collins, 57 Colo. 324, 142 P. 171 (1914).
      </p>

       <b>
        But no power is given in subsection (1)(b) to compel parties to connect outside vaults or privies with the sewer.

       Gault v. City of Ft. Collins, 57 Colo. 324, 142 P. 171 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The power regarding privies is to prohibit them,
       </b>
       within the sewer district, or within 400 feet of a sewer, not to compel them to connect, if not within the prohibited district, the power then is to regulate the construction, maintenance, and use of privies. Gault v. City of Ft. Collins, 57 Colo. 324, 142 P. 171 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Liability for ministerial acts.
       </b>
       Whenever the duty as respects drains and sewers ceases to be legislative or judicial or quasi-judicial, and becomes ministerial, then, although there be no statute giving the action, a municipal corporation is liable to the same extent and on the same principle as a private person or corporation would be under like circumstances for the negligent discharge or the negligent omission to discharge such duty, resulting in an injury to others. McCord v. City of Pueblo, 5 Colo. App. 48, 36 P. 1109 (1894).

        The only power formerly possessed by a town over property was the power "to sell and dispose of" it
       </b>
       and nothing short of a deed of conveyance was a compliance with the statute because the term "sell and dispose of" as used in this statute meant to get rid of, to finish with, to fully relinquish all interest in the property, to transfer and convey the same. Centennial Props., Inc. v. City of Littleton, 154 Colo. 191, 390 P.2d 471 (1964); City of Idaho Springs v. Golden Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 29 Colo. App. 119, 480 P.2d 847 (1970).

        But a city could properly convey real property, yet retain a possibility of reverter to it,

       because possibility of reverter is merely the possibility that the land will come back to the grantor, and the holder of a bare possibility of reverter did not have a present "vested" interest or "estate" in the land.

        Subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) demonstrate a legislative intent to distinguish between property held or used for any governmental purpose, the sale of which must be approved by election, and any other real estate, which may be sold by ordinance.
       </b>
       Although town held subject property for several years, it did not use or hold it for any governmental purpose. Although town entered into lease and option agreement in the context of relocating town hall to the subject property, the contingencies for construction failed to materialize. Therefore, the applicable statutory provision was subsection (1)(b), which applies to "any other real estate", and not subsection (1)(a), which applies to property held for "any governmental purpose". Because town did not use or hold subject property for any governmental purpose, no election was required for the approval of its sale. New Stanley Assocs., LLLP v. Town of Estes Park, 200 P.3d 1118 (Colo. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consideration of potential uses for subject property, without any dedication to a particular use, is not a governmental purpose within the meaning of subsection (1)(a). Moreover, town's retention of subject property for the purpose of using its sale proceeds for construction of infrastructure for a performing arts center site is not a governmental purpose. The relevant statutory provisions address the use or purpose for which real estate is held and not the use or purpose of the proceeds from its sale. Further, appropriation of public funds for the acquisition of subject property does not mean the property is held for a governmental purpose. The general assembly has recognized two types of property in subsection (1), and the distinction is not based on the method of appropriation of funds for the property. Equating the acquisition of property by means of appropriated municipal funds pursuant to § 31-15-302 with "any governmental purpose" under subsection (1)(a) would render meaningless the distinction between subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b).

     <p>
      In order to provide necessary land, buildings, equipment, and other property for governmental or proprietary purposes or for financing of forest health projects, as defined in section 37-95-103 (4.9), any municipality is authorized to enter into long-term rental or leasehold agreements, but in no event shall this be construed as authorizing the use by any municipality of leasehold agreements to finance residential housing. Such agreements may include an option to purchase and acquire title to such leased or rented property within a period not exceeding the useful life of such property and in no case exceeding thirty years. Each such agreement and the terms thereof shall be concluded by an ordinance duly enacted by the municipality. No such ordinance shall take effect before thirty days after its passage and publication. The governing body of any municipality is authorized to provide for the payment of said rentals from a general levy imposed upon both personal and real property included within the boundaries of the municipality; by imposing rates, tolls, and service charges for the use of such property or any part thereof by others; from any other available municipal income; or from any one or more of the said sources. The obligation to pay such rentals shall not constitute an indebtedness of said municipality within the meaning of the constitutional limitations on contracting of indebtedness by municipalities.

      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that methods for the efficient and economical production of usable energy should be achieved whenever possible and that the use of flammable waste material for the conversion of heat into steam, electrical power, or any other form of energy could provide energy in an efficient and economical manner. For such purposes, the provisions of this part 10 are enacted to authorize municipalities to develop this type of energy for their own use and the use of the public.

      Only if an ordinance adopted pursuant to section 31-4-102 (3) or 31-4-302 so provides, any ordinance adopted and all resolutions authorizing the expenditure of money or the entering into of a contract require the approval and signature of the mayor before they become valid, except as otherwise provided in this section. Such ordinance or resolution shall be presented to the mayor within forty-eight hours after the action of the governing body for his signature approving the same. If he disapproves, he shall return such ordinance or resolution to the governing body at its next regular meeting with his objections in writing. The governing body shall cause such objections to be entered at large upon the record and shall proceed at the same or next subsequent meeting to consider the question: "Shall the ordinance or resolution, notwithstanding the mayor's objections, be passed?" If two-thirds of the members of the governing body vote in the affirmative, such resolution shall be valid, and such ordinance shall become a law the same as if it had been approved by the mayor. If the mayor fails to return to the next subsequent meeting of the governing body any resolution or ordinance presented to him for his approval, the same shall become a valid ordinance or resolution, as the case may be, in like manner as if it had been approved by him.

     <p>
      All ordinances, as soon as may be after their adoption, shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose and shall be authenticated by the signature of the presiding officer of the governing body and the clerk. All ordinances of a general or permanent nature and those imposing any fine, penalty, or forfeiture, following adoption and, if required by ordinance adopted pursuant to section 31-4-102 (3) or 31-4-302, compliance with the provisions of section 31-16-104, shall be published in some newspaper published within the limits of the city or town or, if there are none, in some newspaper of general circulation in the city or town. It is a sufficient defense to any suit or prosecution for such fine, penalty, or forfeiture to show that no publication was made. If there is no newspaper published or having a general circulation within the limits of the city or town, then, upon a resolution being passed by the governing body to that effect, ordinances may be published by posting copies thereof in three public places within the limits of the city or town, to be designated by the governing body. Except for ordinances calling for special elections or necessary to the immediate preservation of the public health or safety and containing the reasons making the same necessary in a separate section, such ordinances shall not take effect and be in force before thirty days after they have been so published. The excepted ordinances shall take effect upon adoption and, if required by ordinance adopted pursuant to section 31-4-102 (3) or 31-4-302, compliance with the provisions of section 31-16-104 if they are adopted by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of the governing body of the city or town. The book of ordinances provided for in this section shall be taken and considered in all courts of this state as prima facie evidence that such ordinances have been published as provided by law. Any municipality may determine at a regular or special election to meet the requirements of this section and section 31-16-106 by publishing ordinances by title only rather than by publishing the ordinance in full. No municipality shall call a special election for the sole purpose of determining the issue of whether the municipality should publish new ordinances in full or by title only.

        Scope of power.

       City councils and boards of trustees of cities and towns incorporated under the general statutes are authorized to levy taxes for city or town purposes upon the property in the city or town subject to taxation, and the time within which such annual levy shall be made is not limited, except that it must be done before the county clerk extends the taxes on the tax list and delivers it to the treasurer for collection.

        Taxation defined.
       </b>
       Taxation, as the word is employed in the Colorado constitution and statutes generally, is that burden or charge upon all property laid for raising revenue for general public purposes in defraying the expense of government. Ochs v. Town of Hot Sulphur Springs, 158 Colo. 456, 407 P.2d 677 (1965).

        Special benefits which will sustain a special assessment must be immediate,

        Portion of assessment for general benefit invalid.
       </b>
       So much of an improvement as is designated and utilized for the general benefit of the inhabitants and property within the limits of a municipality is in no sense local, and special assessments to raise funds to construct, purchase, pay for, or maintain that portion of it, cannot be lawfully levied.

      <p>
       The revenues derived from frontage taxes are designated for general purposes of a town, i.e., in maintenance of the town's water system, roads and road equipment, and the manner of imposition of taxes upon properties by a municipality is governed by § 3 of art. X, Colo. Const., prescribing that the same shall be uniform ad valorem taxes. Ochs v. Town of Hot Sulphur Springs, 158 Colo. 456, 407 P.2d 677 (1965).

        Authority to levy a special frontage tax can

      <p>
       <b>
        Spending of special assessments.
       </b>
       If the "taxes" are special assessments upon the properties, the revenues therefrom could not be diverted to providing for general town purposes, but would necessarily have to be used and confined to payment for the capital improvement resulting in an equivalent benefit to plaintiff's properties. Ochs v. Town of Hot Sulphur Springs, 158 Colo. 456, 407 P.2d 677 (1965).

        Showing needed to invalidate tax.

       A grant of power to impose municipal taxes involves a decision by the general assembly that benefits proportionate to the burden will be conferred, and the burden of proof is upon him who assails the legislative action, and to warrant judicial interference, he must show a clear case of violation of the principle exempting private property from condemnation to public use.

         It is the duty of the treasurer of said county and he is authorized to collect the municipal taxes in the same manner and at the same time as other taxes upon the same tax list are collected. The expense of construction and repair of sidewalks, streets, paving of streets, curb and gutter, drainage facilities, or other improvements, which are placed upon municipal streets, other than pursuant to part 5 of article 25 of this title, shall be assessed in the manner prescribed by the ordinance of any such municipality upon the property fronting upon the same. Except for the construction and repair of sidewalks, no such assessments for other construction shall be made by the municipality unless approved by petition signed by not less than sixty percent of the owners of property fronting upon the same and owning at least sixty percent of the property fronting thereon. Such assessment shall be a lien upon said property until it is paid. In case of failure to pay such assessment in a reasonable time, to be specified by ordinance, the assessment, at any time after such failure, may be certified by the clerk of such municipality to the officer having the custody of the tax list at the time such certification is made to be placed by him upon such tax list for the current year and collected in the same manner as other taxes are collected, with ten percent penalty thereon to defray the cost of collection. All the laws of the state for the assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale of property for taxes and their redemption of the same, shall apply and have as full effect for the collection of all such municipal taxes as for such general taxes, except as modified by this title.

As collected, all taxes levied for payment of interest on and for the payment or redemption of the principal of such bonds shall be kept by the treasurer of the municipality in a special fund to be used only in the payment of the interest upon and for the payment or redemption of the principal of such bonds. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner as other municipal taxes are levied and collected.

        Legal consequences of dedication.

       The section declares that all streets, etc., described as for public use on the map or plat of any city, or any additions, shall be deemed to be public property and the fee thereof vested in such city or town. In thus providing, this section declares that the legal consequence of a dedication is that the streets, etc., are deemed to be public property and the fee is vested in the city. Buell v.

        Statutory dedication and common-law dedication distinguished.
       </b>
       A statutory dedication operates by way of grant and ordinarily conveys the full fee title to the subject property, whereas a common-law dedication operates by way of "estoppel in pais" and ordinarily conveys only an easement. City of Greenwood Vill. v. Boyd, 624 P.2d 362 (Colo. App. 1981); State Dept. of Highways v. Town of Silverthorne, 707 P.2d 1017 (Colo. App. 1985), cert. dismissed, 736 P.2d 411 (1987).

       <b>
        Whether there has been a common-law dedication is a question of fact,

       Language of dedication in developer's plats and planned unit development plan, i.e., "dedicate to the public all roadways and easements for purposes shown hereon", buttressed by the other evidence, was sufficient only to convey to the public the use of the area dedicated for the limited purposes specified plus concurrent use of the area for utility and drainage easement purposes.

        City not limited to mere easement.
       </b>
       It cannot be said that merely because the grantor has granted the entire highway and continues to own the land which abuts the highway on one side, that he has a right to the whole or any part of the highway when it is vacated, as there is nothing in this section which suggests that the interest granted to the city is limited to an easement. Buell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 205 F. Supp. 865 (D. Colo. 1962), modified, 321 F.2d 468 (10th Cir. 1963).

       <b>
        The fee granted is a limited one, in trust for the abutting owners and the users of the street,
       </b>
       but the city nevertheless has a title to the property sufficient to allow disposition of it in accordance with § 43-2-302. Buell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 205 F. Supp. 865 (D. Colo. 1962), modified, 321 F.2d 468 (10th Cir. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rights of abutting owner retained.
       </b>
       When a dedication satisfied this section and vested a fee in the city to the surface and so much thereof as was reasonably necessary for street and highway purposes, it operated to divest the dedicator of the property in it except to the extent of his rights as an abutting owner -- rights extending only to the center of the street as dedicated. Buell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 205 F. Supp. 865 (D. Colo. 1962), modified, 321 F.2d 468 (10th Cir. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Title of vacated portions vests in adjoining owner.
       </b>
       A dedicator, even though not immediately divested of subsurface rights, is on notice at the time of dedication that if a portion of the dedicated street should be vacated by the city and county unconditional title would vest in the adjoining owner. Buell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 321 F.2d 468 (10th Cir. 1963).

       It is the duty of the commission to make and adopt a master plan for the physical development of the municipality, including any areas outside its boundaries, subject to the approval of the governmental body having jurisdiction thereof, that in the commission's judgment bear relation to the planning of the municipality. The master plan of a municipality is an advisory document to guide land development decisions; however, the plan or any part thereof may be made binding by inclusion in the municipality's adopted subdivision, zoning, platting, planned unit development, or other similar land development regulations after satisfying notice, due process, and hearing requirements for legislative or quasi-judicial processes as appropriate. When a commission decides to adopt a master plan, the commission shall conduct public hearings, after notice of such public hearings has been published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in a manner sufficient to notify the public of the time, place, and nature of the public hearing, prior to final adoption of a master plan in order to encourage public participation in and awareness of the development of such plan and shall accept and consider oral and written public comments throughout the process of developing the plan. The plan, with the accompanying maps, plats, charts, and descriptive matter, must, after consideration of each of the following, where applicable or appropriate, show the commission's recommendations for the development of the municipality and outlying areas, including:

      The commission may adopt the plan as a whole by a single resolution or may by successive resolutions adopt successive parts of the plan (said parts corresponding with major geographical sections or divisions of the municipality or with functional subdivisions of the subject matter of the plan) and may adopt any amendment or extension thereof or addition thereto. Before the adoption of the plan or any such part, amendment, extension, or addition, the commission shall hold at least one public hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be given by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in the official newspaper of the county affected. The adoption of the plan, any part, amendment, extension, or addition shall be by resolution of the commission carried by the affirmative votes of not less than two-thirds of the entire membership of the commission. The resolution shall refer expressly to the maps and descriptive and other matter intended by the commission to form the whole or part of the plan, and the action taken shall be recorded on the map and plan and descriptive matter by the identifying signature of the chairman or secretary of the commission. An attested copy of the plan or part thereof shall be certified to each governmental body of the territory affected and, after the approval by each body, shall be filed with the county clerk and recorder of each county wherein the territory is located.

     <p>
      Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision, transfers or sells, agrees to sell, or negotiates to sell any land by reference to or exhibition of or by use of a plat of a subdivision before such plat has been approved by the commission and recorded or filed in the office of the appropriate county clerk and recorder shall pay a penalty of one hundred dollars to the municipality for each lot or parcel so transferred, or sold, or agreed or negotiated to be sold. The description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties or from the remedies provided in this section. The municipality may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by action for injunction brought in any court of competent jurisdiction and may recover the penalty by civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.

       The power and force of the police power attends in the regulations provided in zoning ordinances, and the rule is that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply. Flinn v. Treadwell, 120 Colo. 117, 207 P.2d 967 (1949); Witkin Homes, Inc. v. City &amp; County of Denver, 31 Colo. App. 410, 504 P.2d 1121 (1972).

        If necessary to protect compelling and substantial government interest.

        A zoning ordinance is presumed to be valid

      </p>
      <p>
       Once the power to classify land to specified uses is exercised by a city, it is entitled to a presumption of validity and one assailing it bears the burden of overcoming that presumption, and courts indulge every intendment in favor of its validity. Bird v. City of Colo. Springs, 176 Colo. 32, 489 P.2d 324 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Zoning ordinances, like other legislative enactments, are presumed valid. Ford Leasing Dev. Co. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 186 Colo. 418, 528 P.2d 237 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       A home-rule city zoning code is a legislative enactment which is presumed to be valid. City of Greeley v. Ells, 186 Colo. 352, 527 P.2d 538 (1974).

      </p>
      <p>
       To overcome the presumption that a city has validly exercised its zoning powers, the one claiming invalidity must establish such invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt. Bird v. City of Colo. Springs, 176 Colo. 32, 489 P.2d 324 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In challenging the validity of a zoning ordinance, it is incumbent upon the aggrieved party to establish that as applied to this property, the ordinance is confiscatory and deprives him of the use of his land without due process of law. City &amp; County of Denver v. Chuck Ruwart Chevrolet, Inc., 32 Colo. App. 191, 508 P.2d 789 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption of validity which a zoning ordinance possesses imposes upon the litigant challenging the ordinance's validity the burden of proving that the ordinance is unconstitutional by "clear and convincing" evidence. City of Greeley v. Ells, 186 Colo. 352, 527 P.2d 538 (1974).

       <b>
        Substantial compliance with statutory provisions is required for lawful enactment of a zoning change
       </b>
       and failure to comply with essential mandates of the statutes invalidates the proceeding. Wainwright v. City of Wheat Ridge, 38 Colo. App. 485, 558 P.2d 1005 (1976).

      <p>
       <b>
        Factors to be considered in construing ordinance.
       </b>
       Because zoning laws should be given a fair and reasonable construction in light of the setting in which employed, the factors surrounding adoption of an ordinance should be considered. Wainwright v. City of Wheat Ridge, 38 Colo. App. 485, 558 P.2d 1005 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Zoning, since it restricts an owner's right to use his property, constitutes a partial taking, but it is constitutionally
       </b>
       permissible, however, so long as it is reasonable. Serv. Oil Co. v. Rhodus, 179 Colo. 335, 500 P.2d 807 (1972).

        And a landowner need not be permitted to make the most profitable use of his land.

It is inconsistent with this intent for a city council to base its denial of a special use permit on the adverse effects of the group home on the single family characteristics of the neighborhood or on the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, in addition to the attitude of general hostility in the neighborhood towards this proposes facility.

       The governing body shall provide for the appointment of a board of adjustment consisting of five members, each to be appointed for three years, unless the governing body by ordinance establishes a different number of members or term of office. The governing body may provide by ordinance for filling vacancies on the board, for designation of alternate members, and for removal of members for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by any administrative official charged with the enforcement of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this part 3. It shall also hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under such ordinance. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, the concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to effect any variation in such ordinance. Every decision of such board shall be subject, however, to review by certiorari by the district court of the county within which the municipality or any part thereof is located. Such appeal shall be filed not later than thirty days from the final action taken by the board of adjustment. Such appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a23p03s31-23-307ol12">
       An appeal to the board of adjustment shall be taken within such time as prescribed by the board of adjustment by general rule by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall at once transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a23p03s31-23-307ol13">
       An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal has been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by the district court on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a23p03s31-23-307ol14">
       The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give due notice thereof to the parties, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and shall make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises and to that end has all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of such ordinance, the board of adjustment has the power, in passing upon appeals, to vary or modify the application of the regulations or provisions of such ordinance relating to the use, construction, or alteration of buildings or structures, or the use of land, so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The governing body by ordinance may eliminate the board of adjustment's authority to grant use variances or use modifications, or may transfer that authority to some other board, agency, or commission, or to the governing body of the municipality. Where feasible, the board of adjustment may vary or modify the application of the regulations for the purpose of considering access to sunlight for solar energy devices.

        Public purpose.

       The acquisition of properties and the elimination of their slum or blighted character constitutes a public purpose; that what is involved is an urban reclamation project; and the fact that when the redevelopment is achieved the properties are sold to private individuals for the purpose of development does not rob the taking of its public purpose.

       Although the general assembly's method is to be accomplished not by public ownership of the land but rather through private endeavor and ownership under the direction of authorized officials. The acquisition and transfer to private parties is a mere incident of the chief purpose of the act which is rehabilitation of the area. The fact that the property would not continue to be owned by the city does not mean that the use was not a public one. Rabinoff v. District Court, 145 Colo. 225, 360 P.2d 114 (1961).

        Due process requires a city to provide a property owner with direct notice of the adverse blight determination.
       </b>
       In contemporary terms this means notice had to be mailed, emailed, or personally served. An owner's ability to preserve its property right in the statutory right of review depends on its knowledge of the simple fact the blight finding exists. M.A.K. Inv. Grp., LLC v.

      </p>
      <p>

       <b>
        Basis for finding area blighted.
       </b>
       The fact that there were not widespread violations of building and health ordinances does not of itself establish arbitrariness on the part of the responsible authorities in the finding that the area was slum and blighted. Rabinoff v. District Court, 145 Colo. 225, 360 P.2d 114 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        One well-kept building does not in itself defeat the determination of a blighted area.
       </b>
       If the building owned by plaintiff, be, as claimed, a magnificent victorian type edifice such would not in itself defeat the determination that the area, taken as a whole, is a slum and blighted area. Interstate Trust Bldg. Co. v. Denver Urban Renewal Auth., 172 Colo. 427, 473 P.2d 978 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        "Blighted area" construed.
       </b>
       The definition of "blighted area" contained in subsection (2) is broad and not only encompasses those areas containing properties so dilapidated as to justify condemnation as nuisances, but also envisions the prevention of deterioration. The absence of widespread violations of building and health ordinances does not of itself establish arbitrariness on the part of a city council in finding blight. Tracy v. City of Boulder, 635 P.2d 907 (Colo. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Determination of "blighted area" by council is legislative question.
       </b>
       A city council's determination as to whether an area is blighted, when such determination relates to the need for an ordinance, is a legislative question and scope of review by the judiciary is restricted. Tracy v. City of Boulder, 635 P.2d 907 (Colo. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        If actual purpose behind a particular urban renewal plan is not the elimination or prevention of blight or slums,
       </b>
       the urban renewal authority does not have the power to condemn land in furtherance of that plan because the determination of necessity is not supported by the record. City &amp; County of Denver v. Block 173, 814 P.2d 824 (Colo. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Proper purpose for which a condemnation action may be instituted
       </b>
       in the context of urban renewal is limited to plans adopted to remedy identified slum or blight conditions, and fact that such conditions were found to exist is not dispositive if the purpose in designating a large study area and in targeting block 173 as part of that area was to acquire block 173 for private purposes. City &amp; County of Denver v. Block 173, 814 P.2d 824 (Colo. 1991).

        Quarry lake property is no longer subject to municipality's 1981 blight determination, because the statutory procedures for removing blight were followed.
       </b>
       The urban renewal authority disposed of the quarry lake property according to the terms of state's urban renewal law and certified the uses to which the lake was devoted comported with the urban renewal plan. After duly disposing of the lake property, certifying that the property was being used in accordance with the urban renewal plan, and having notice at all relevant times of the developer's efforts to incorporate the lake into its office park, the urban renewal authority cannot now claim that the lake has never been developed in accordance with the urban renewal plan. On the contrary, the quarry lake has been developed in accordance with the procedures laid out in the state's urban renewal law and, thus, can no longer be considered "blighted" under the municipality's 1981 blight determination.

        Federal statutes not determinative of right to recovery.
       </b>
       In a condemnation action under the statutes and constitution of Colorado, a landowner's right to compensation and the extent thereof must be determined by the applicable law of Colorado, so the right to recovery is not dependent upon nor limited by federal statutes. Denver Urban Renewal Auth. v. Steiner Am. Corp., 31 Colo. App. 125, 500 P.2d 983 (1972).

       <b>
        No clear indication in subsection (1)(e) of an urban renewal authority's powers to place the decision to condemn in the hands of a private party.
       </b>
       The Urban Renewal Law mentions many conventional matters that urban renewal authorities could effectuate only through contracts with private parties. No provision, however, suggests that urban renewal authorities may, through contract, delegate to private parties the prerogative of taking property by eminent domain. Subsection (1)(e) speaks of exercising the power of eminent domain "in the manner provided by the laws of this state", none of which authorizes the delegation of that power by contract to private entities. Grants of power to exercise the sovereign right of eminent domain, in derogation of the common private rights of individuals, are generally strictly construed. Cornerstone Group XXII v. Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth., 151 P.3d 601 (Colo. App. 2006), rev'd on other grounds, 176 P.3d 737 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because district court lacked authority to order the specific performance of a contractual obligation to exercise the core governmental power of eminent domain and urban renewal authority could not be estopped from abandoning its condemnation petitions, judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.
       </b>
       However, because authority's agreement to acquire specific properties by condemnation, if necessary, does not render the contract void under reserved powers doctrine, case is remanded and district court directed to consider respondent's remaining claims, including breach of contract. Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth. v. Cornerstone Group XXII, 176 P.3d 737 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Purpose of subsection (1)(j)
       </b>
       is to provide supplemental assistance for particular losses incurred by reason of dislocation, in an effort to reduce the burden falling on the property owner whose property is condemned. Auraria Businessmen Against Confiscation, Inc. v. Denver Urban Renewal Auth., 183 Colo. 441, 517 P.2d 845 (1974).

       </b>
       Subsection (1)(j) of this section and §§ 24-56-103, 24-56-104, and 24-56-105 do not create discriminatory and unjustified classifications which deny small businessmen equal protection of the law.

        And evidence of business profits inadmissible.
       </b>

       <b>
        Except to show use of property.
       </b>
       Under the business profits rule, evidence of the character and volume of business conducted on condemned property is admissible only for the limited purpose of showing a use for which the property may be utilized. Denver Urban Renewal Auth. v. Cook, 186 Colo. 182, 526 P.2d 652 (1974); Denver Urban Renewal Auth. v. Berglund-Cherne Co., 193 Colo. 562, 568 P.2d 478 (1977).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because gross sales, like profits, are more inextricably tied to management and administration of a business
       </b>
       than to the value of the property upon which the business is situated, and thus, the same reasons that cause the amount of profits to be an inappropriate measure of the value of the land are applicable to the use of gross sales figures, albeit to a lesser degree.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The foundation for the business profits rule
       </b>

The authority may also at the same time invite proposals for redevelopment or rehabilitation from other interested persons who may not be property owners, owners of business concerns, or residents within the urban renewal area, and may provide public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation within the municipality in which the authority has been established.

        No clear indication in section of an urban renewal authority's powers to place the decision to condemn in the hands of a private party.
       </b>
       The Urban Renewal Law mentions many conventional matters that urban renewal authorities could effectuate only though contracts with private parties. No provision, however, suggests that urban renewal authorities may, through contract, delegate to private parties the prerogative of taking property by eminent domain. Purpose of this section is to restrict eminent domain when used to acquire private property for transfer to another private party. Grants of power to exercise the sovereign right of eminent domain, in derogation of the common private rights of individuals, are generally strictly construed. Cornerstone Group XXII v. Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth., 151 P.3d 601 (Colo. App. 2006), rev'd on other grounds, 176 P.3d 737 (Colo. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Because district court lacked authority to order the specific performance of a contractual obligation to exercise the core governmental power of eminent domain and urban renewal authority could not be estopped from abandoning its condemnation petitions, judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.
       </b>
       However, because authority's agreement to acquire specific properties by condemnation, if necessary, does not render the contract void under reserved powers doctrine, case is remanded and district court directed to consider respondent's remaining claims, including breach of contract.

The purchasers, lessees, transferees, and their successors and assigns are obligated to devote such real property only to the land uses, designs, building requirements, timing, or procedure specified in the urban renewal plan and may be obligated to comply with such other requirements as the authority may determine to be in the public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on such real property required by the urban renewal plan. Such real property or interest shall be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred at not less than its fair value (as determined by the authority) for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan, an authority shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in such plan; the restrictions upon and the covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee; and the objectives of such plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas. Real property acquired by an authority which, in accordance with the provisions of the urban renewal plan, is to be transferred shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the carrying out of the provisions of the urban renewal plan. Any contract for such transfer and the urban renewal plan (or such part of such contract or plan as the authority may determine) may be recorded in the land records of the county in such manner as to afford actual or constructive notice thereof.

Such notice shall identify the area, or portion thereof, and shall state that such further information as is available may be obtained at the office designated in the notice. The authority shall consider all such redevelopment or rehabilitation proposals and the financial and legal ability of the persons making such proposals to carry them out and may negotiate with any persons for proposals for the purchase, lease, or other transfer of any real property acquired by the authority in the urban renewal area. The authority may accept such proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this part 1; except that a notification of intention to accept such proposal shall be filed with the governing body not less than fifteen days prior to any such acceptance. Thereafter, the authority may execute such contract in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and deliver deeds, leases, and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such contract.

        Trial court correctly held that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue claims alleging a violation of state Urban Renewal Law.
       </b>
       A plaintiff has standing if he or she (1) incurred an injury in fact (2) to a legally protected interest, as contemplated by statutory or constitutional provisions. To satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the controlling test for standing, the injury must be direct and palpable. A claimed injury that, as here, is presently speculative and that cannot be determined until a remote time in the future is not sufficiently direct and palpable to support a finding of injury in fact. To determine whether plaintiff has a legal interest that entitles her to judicial redress, court must consider whether Urban Renewal Law reflects a legislative purpose to confer such an interest. Court finds that general assembly did not intend to create a right in taxpayers to enforce the statute. Implying such a right in taxpayers is also inconsistent with the statutory scheme. Olson v. City of Golden, 53 P.3d 747 (Colo. App. 2002).

        Urban renewal authority lacks statutory authority to condemn subject parcel of real property that is no longer subject to blight determination.
       </b>
       Neither lake parcel nor Arvada marketplace parcel is subject to municipality's 1981 blight finding. Once the purpose of eliminating or preventing the spread of blight has been achieved, the urban renewal authority may no longer rely on a municipality's initial blight determination to condemn property because it can no longer exercise its condemnation powers in furtherance of a valid public purpose. Thus, the statutory basis for the urban renewal authority's power to condemn, the elimination of blight, is no longer present. Accordingly, where blight has been eliminated from a parcel that lies within an urban renewal area, an urban renewal authority no longer has any statutory basis to exercise its condemnation power over or for the benefit of that parcel.

       The urban renewal authority disposed of the quarry lake property according to the terms of state's urban renewal law and certified the uses to which the lake was devoted comported with the urban renewal plan. After duly disposing of the lake property, certifying that the property was being used in accordance with the urban renewal plan, and having notice at all relevant times of the developer's efforts to incorporate the lake into its office park, the urban renewal authority cannot now claim that the lake has never been developed in accordance with the urban renewal plan. On the contrary, the quarry lake has been developed in accordance with the procedures laid out in the state's urban renewal law and, thus, can no longer be considered "blighted" under the municipality's 1981 blight determination.

        Urban renewal authority lacks statutory authority to condemn subject parcel of real property that is no longer subject to blight determination.
       </b>
       Neither lake parcel nor Arvada marketplace parcel is subject to municipality's 1981 blight finding. Once the purpose of eliminating or preventing the spread of blight has been achieved, the urban renewal authority may no longer rely on a municipality's initial blight determination to condemn property because it can no longer exercise its condemnation powers in furtherance of a valid public purpose. Thus, the statutory basis for the urban renewal authority's power to condemn, the elimination of blight, is no longer present. Accordingly, where blight has been eliminated from a parcel that lies within an urban renewal area, an urban renewal authority no longer has any statutory basis to exercise its condemnation power over or for the benefit of that parcel.

       Assessor's calculation frustrates the legislative intent of the statute because it fails to give effect to the statutory requirement in subsection (9)(a)(II) that the portion of property tax in excess of the base amount be allocated to the authority. A calculation that creates an imbalance in an authority's TIF by including property in the base value while removing the same property from the new assessed value impedes the goals of addressing and financing renewal of blighted areas.

Because the TIF provision was adopted in 1992 and no new TIF provision was adopted in 2004 or 2008 when new property was added to the urban renewal area, the twenty-five year period for the added property began in 1992.

        Arbitration under subsection (12) is not county's exclusive remedy for all challenges to an urban renewal plan.
       </b>
       The arbitration process is a county's exclusive remedy only with respect to challenges related to subsections (3.5)(a)(III), (IV), and (4)(b). Because the county assessor's interpretation of subsection (9)(a) is unrelated to compliance with subsections (3.5)(a)(III), (IV), and (4)(b), county's failure to arbitrate TIF issue does not bar assessor's defense to claims city asserted against him.

        Assessor's defense to city's claims is not barred by issue preclusion, collateral estoppel, or equitable estoppel.
       </b>
       First, the assessor's claim is not precluded by issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) because the meaning of the statute and the question of whether the city had the power to delay the start of the TIF clock was not decided during public hearings. Nor is the assessor's defense barred by claim preclusion (res judicata) because he was not party to or in privity with a party to the public hearings in which the plans were approved. Finally the assessor's defense is not barred by equitable estoppel because the city could not have reasonably relied on the assessor's or the county's inaction in a public hearing where the law grants them no role. Neither the assessor nor the county played any role in the public approval process. City of Aurora v. Scott, 2017 COA 24, 410 P.3d 720.

        A municipality's power to control the timing of an urban renewal plan under subsection (8) does not encompass the power of the municipality to write its own TIF timeline.
       </b>
       The Urban Renewal Law (URL) does not permit a municipality to alter or evade the twenty-five year time limitation on TIF provisions by denominating parts of an urban renewal plan "effective" on a date years after the plan was actually approved.

        The twenty-five year period begins when the TIF provision is adopted.
       </b>
       A TIF provision is adopted on the date the plan or modification containing such a provision was approved. By tying the TIF period to the TIF provisions rather than the plan, the legislature has allowed for TIF provisions to run from the date a provision was approved, even if it was added to a plan later. Where there is no subsequent modification of the plan or a modification does not include a new TIF provision, the TIF provision is "adopted" when the original plan was approved. City of Aurora v. Scott, 2017 COA 24, 410 P.3d 720.

        Subsection (9)(a)(I) sets the date for the base valuation and subsection (9)(a)(II) requires taxes in excess of the base valuation to be allocated to the urban renewal fund.
       </b>
       When read together these provisions require that TIF allocations begin on the effective date of approval of the urban renewal plan or modification containing the TIF provision. The common understanding of the phrase "effective date of adoption of such a provision" in subsection (9)(a) is the date on which a provision becomes enforceable or operational through a municipality's act of formally sanctioning or agreeing to the provision. To permit a city to define the "effective date of adoption of a [TIF] provision" would effectively allow the city to circumvent the statutory time limit. Allowing a city to define the "effective date of adoption" as any convenient date, regardless of when the provision was actually approved, would divorce the TIF timeline from the date of adoption and create a TIF limit of twenty-five years from any date chosen by the municipality. The statutory language does not support such a result. City of Aurora v. Scott, 2017 COA 24, 410 P.3d 720.

       <b>
        Adopting an urban renewal plan is not a legislative act.
       </b>
       Even if approving an urban renewal plan could be characterized as legislative, approving these plans would be beyond the city's powers because the plans conflict with the URL's TIF timeline. The public approval process includes notice and an opportunity to be heard for interested individuals, involves the application of existing standards to factors developed at a hearing, and affects specific individuals (as opposed to being generally applicable public policy). These are all factors that suggest a quasi-judicial decision. Moreover, even if approving an urban renewal plan could be characterized as legislative, approving these plans would be beyond the city's powers because the plan conflicts with the URL's TIF timeline. If a local ordinance conflicts with a state law in a matter of mixed state and local concern, the ordinance is superseded by state statute. The city plans' TIF provisions conflict with URL time limits. Therefore, even if the city's acts were legislative, they would nevertheless be invalid. City of Aurora v. Scott, 2017 COA 24, 410 P.3d 720.

The power of eminent domain granted by this section, with respect to the acquisition of lands for parks or recreational purposes for the preservation or conservation of sites, scenes, open space, and vistas of scientific, historic, aesthetic, or other public interest may not be used by any city or city and county to condemn property lying five miles or further from its corporate limits, unless:

       "Intersecting street" means any street which meets or crosses a pedestrian mall at a mall intersection but includes only those portions thereof on either side of a mall intersection which lie between the mall intersection and the first intersection of the intersecting street with a municipal street or highway open to vehicular traffic. If any portion of a pedestrian mall terminates on a street at a place thereon other than a place of intersection with a municipal street or state highway open to vehicular traffic, "intersecting street" also includes that portion of any street which lies between such place of termination and the first intersection of such street with a municipal street or state highway open to vehicular traffic.

       Any person owning, or having any legal or equitable interest in, any real property which might suffer legal damage by reason of the establishment of the proposed pedestrian mall shall file, prior to the first reading of the ordinance establishing the pedestrian mall, a written claim for damages with the clerk. Such written claim shall describe the real property as to which the claim is made, shall state the exact nature of the claimant's interest therein, shall state the exact nature of and grounds for the claimed damage thereto, and shall state the amount of damages claimed. The failure to file such written claim within the time provided in this subsection (1) is a waiver of any claim for damages or compensation and shall operate as a complete bar to any subsequent action seeking to prevent the establishment of said pedestrian mall or to recover damages on account of such establishment, and, in the event a claim is filed, such filing shall operate as a complete bar in any subsequent action for the recovery of any damages or compensation in excess of the amount stated in such claim. Any such claim may be withdrawn by the claimant at any time by written withdrawal with the same effect as if it had never been filed. The governing body shall receipt for the claims that have been filed in accordance with this section for damages or compensation from the establishment of the proposed mall.

       The governing body may allow any claim for damages made pursuant to this section. Any claim so allowed shall be for the full amount of damages claimed in the written claim; except that the governing body, with the written consent of the claimant, may allow a claim for a lesser amount. In the event the claim is not allowed in full, or a suitable lesser amount is not agreed upon between the claimant and the governing body, or the governing body refuses to recognize the claim, the claimant or the governing body, through its legal counsel, may institute proceedings in court to ascertain the amount, if any, due the claimant; however, in no event shall an action be instituted later than two years after the date the claim has been denied. Any amount determined to be due to the claimant shall accrue interest at six percent per annum from the date that vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall, which closing in fact is the act from which the claimed damages arise.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a25p04s31-25-406ol13">
       Before vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall, the governing body or another agency to which it is intended the mall will be conveyed shall pay the amounts allowed or enter into agreements with good and sufficient surety to pay the principal amounts allowed or, in the event the claim is to be litigated, an amount which the court determines is sufficient to pay the compensation in that behalf when ascertained. The required surety bond may be waived in writing by the claimant.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a25p04s31-25-406ol14">

In this connection, the general assembly expressly declares that, to the extent to which the establishment of a pedestrian mall is justifiable as an exercise of the police power for which no compensation is constitutionally required, no damages or compensation shall be allowed in any action.

       The compensation procedure under this section is different in its commencement than the usual condemnation suit. Difference in this procedure, however, does not reach a constitutional height. Nothing in the United States or Colorado constitutions proscribes the procedure prescribed by this section. City of Boulder v. Kahn's, Inc., 190 Colo. 90, 543 P.2d 711 (1975).

II, Colo. Const., there must be compensation. Rather, to constitute such a taking there must be an unreasonable or substantial deprivation of access. City of Boulder v.

       A district may be created within the boundaries of a municipality and may also include any property in the unincorporated area of the county within which the municipality is situated if such county consents by resolution to such district and the construction or acquisition of improvements therein. In addition, such district may also include any property in another municipality within such county if such municipality consents by ordinance to such district and the construction or acquisition of the improvements therein. If a district includes property within a county by county consent or within another municipality by municipal consent, the municipality shall have full authority to construct or acquire improvements, to assess property within the county or such municipality benefited by such improvements, and to enforce and collect such assessments in the manner provided in this part 5; but:

         No improvement, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection (1) and except for sidewalks, water mains, sewers, and sewage disposal works and their appurtenances, shall be ordered under this part 5 unless a petition for the same is first presented. The petition shall be subscribed by the owners of property to be assessed for more than one-half of the entire costs estimated by the governing body to be assessed. Except as specified in this section, nothing in this part 5 shall restrict the right of such owners from securing any particular kind or variety of improvements petitioned for. In any case where a proposed improvement district includes two or more assessment units, the owners of property to be assessed for more than one-half of the entire costs estimated by the governing body to be assessed in each assessment unit shall petition as specified in this part 5.

If initiated by such resolution, the governing body shall make a preliminary order as required by subsection (3) of this section in the same manner as if the improvements had been requested by petition. Such preliminary order may be included in the resolution of intention to construct the improvements. However, if written protests are submitted prior to the hearing referred to in subsection (4) of this section subscribed by the owners of property to be assessed for more than one-half of the entire costs estimated by the governing body to be assessed, the governing body shall not proceed with such special improvement district, based on the preliminary order so protested.

     <p>
      When the governing body declares the same necessary for sanitary reasons, it may order the construction of district sanitary sewers in districts to be prescribed by ordinance so as to connect with any public or district sewer or with some natural drainage or disposal plant. Such districts, by like authority, may be divided into subdistricts or enlarged, diminished, or otherwise altered by ordinance at any time in accordance with the provisions of this part 5. The contract for district sewers may include all necessary manholes, inlets, and appurtenances and such mains of such reasonable extent outside the district as may be necessary to connect the district with a public sewer or some natural drainage or disposal plant. Contiguous municipalities may unite in the construction of a common sewer or cooperate in such construction or extend to each other the right to use any sewer constructed or to be constructed when such use may be deemed necessary for the discharge of the sewage of either, and such cooperation, common construction, or use shall be upon such terms as regards the apportionment of cost as may be agreed upon between the governing bodies of such contiguous municipalities.

      Upon completion of any local improvement or upon completion from time to time of any part thereof and upon acceptance thereof by the governing body or when the total cost of any improvement or of any such part thereof can be reasonably ascertained, either prior to, during, or subsequent to the construction of the improvements, the governing body shall cause to be prepared a statement showing the whole cost of the improvement, including costs of inspection and collection, capitalized interest on any bonds for such period as the governing body may deem necessary, capitalized bond reserves, and all other incidental costs, the portion thereof, if any, to be paid by the municipality, and the portion thereof to be assessed upon each lot or tract of land to be assessed for the same, which statement shall be filed in the office of the clerk. If the governing body determines that the basis of assessment is inequitable in any case, a just and equitable assessment shall be made upon the basis of benefits accruing to the property assessed by reason of the improvements made.

        Effect of omission of property that should have been assessed.
       </b>
       The omission of property which should have been assessed to pay the cost of a public improvement does not render the assessment or the proceedings void. All that could be claimed in such circumstances would be, that the assessment on property taxed for such improvement should be reduced to the extent it would have been had the omitted property been charged with its proportionate share of the expense. Hildreth v. City of Longmont, 47 Colo. 79, 105 P. 107 (1909).

       <b>
        Burden of proof.
       </b>
       Granting the city the benefit of this statute puts upon the property owner the burden of showing that the property assessed was not benefited. The trial court correctly found that no benefit inured to the railroad from ample evidence in the record. Town of Fort Lupton v. Union P. R. R., 156 Colo. 352, 399 P.2d 248 (1965).

       <b>
        To overcome prima facie evidence.
       </b>
       The passage of an ordinance of assessment for such improvements shall be prima facie evidence of the fact that the property assessed for such improvements is benefited and that such assessments have been lawfully levied. The burden is upon the plaintiff under said statute to overcome this presumption. Heron v. City of Englewood, 155 Colo. 480, 395 P.2d 356 (1964).

       Where the body having authority to correct errors and inequalities in the assessment renounces such authority and refuses to hear testimony, the proceeding cannot be regarded as a hearing, and the assessment is void. Equity will, at the suit of the property owner, annul the assessment, ascertain the just amount chargeable against the property, and, upon payment thereof into court, restrain the collection of the residue.

       At any sale by the county treasurer of any property for the purpose of paying any special assessment for local improvements made under the provisions of this part 5, the municipal treasurer, having written authority from the governing body, may purchase any such property without paying for the same in cash and shall receive certificates of purchase therefor in the name of the municipality. The certificates shall be received and credited at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, on account of the assessments in pursuance of which the sale was made. The certificates may thereafter be sold by the municipal treasurer at their face value, with all interest and penalties accrued, and assigned by him to the purchaser in the name of the municipality. The proceeds of such sale shall be credited to the fund created by ordinance for the payment of such assessments respectively. In the event that all bonded indebtedness incurred in payment for said local improvements has been discharged in full, said certificates may be sold by the governing body for the best price obtainable at public sale, at auction, or by sealed bids in the same manner and under the same conditions as is provided in subsection (3) of this section. The proceeds shall be credited to the general fund of said municipality or to the special surplus and deficiency fund provided for by section 31-25-534 (2), as the circumstances may require. Such assignments shall be without recourse, and the sale and assignments shall operate as a lien in favor of the purchaser and assignee as is provided by law in the case of sale of real estate in default of payment of the general property tax.

      </li>

       Cumulatively with all other remedies, any municipality which is the owner of property by virtue of a tax deed, or is the owner of property otherwise acquired, in satisfaction or discharge of the liens represented by such certificates of sale, may sell such property for the best price obtainable at public sale, at auction, or by sealed bids. Such sales shall be after public notice by the municipal treasurer or clerk to all persons having or claiming any interest in the property to be sold or in the proceeds of such sale by publication of such notice three times, a week apart, in a weekly or daily newspaper of general circulation within the county in which the property is located. Such notice shall describe the property and state the time, place, and manner of receiving bids; except that the time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten days after the last publication. The municipality may reject any and all bids. Any interested party, at any time within ten days after the receipt of bids for the sale of property, may file with the municipality a written protest as to the sufficiency of the amount of any bid made or the validity of the proceedings for the sale. If the protest is denied, such person, within ten days thereafter, shall commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the municipality from completing the sale. If no such action is commenced, all protests or objections to the sale shall be waived and the municipality shall then convey the property to the successful bidder by quitclaim deed.

      <li id="t31a25p05s31-25-534ol11">
       For the purpose of paying all or such portion of the cost of any improvement constructed under this part 5 as may be assessed against the property specially benefited, special assessment bonds of the municipality may be issued of such date, in such form, and on such terms, including, without limitation, provisions for their sale, payment, and redemption, as may be prescribed by the governing body, bearing the name of the street, alley, or district improved and payable in a sufficient period of years after such date to cover the period of payment provided and in convenient denominations. All such bonds shall be issued upon estimates approved by the governing body, and the municipal treasurer shall preserve a record of the same in a suitable book kept for that purpose. All such bonds shall be subscribed by the mayor, countersigned by the municipal treasurer, with the corporate seal thereto affixed, and attested by the clerk. Such bonds shall be payable out of the moneys collected on account of the assessments made for said improvements, from reserve accounts, if any, established to secure payment of such bonds, and from any other legally available moneys. Whenever three-fourths of the bonds for an improvement constructed under this part 5 have been paid and canceled and for any reason any remaining assessments are not paid in time to pay the remaining bonds for the district and the interest due thereon, the municipality may pay, from legally available moneys, the bonds when due and the interest due thereon and reimburse itself by collecting the unpaid assessments due the district. All moneys collected from such assessments for any improvement shall be applied to the payment of the bonds issued until payment in full is made of all the bonds, both principal and interest, or to fund or replenish reserve accounts, if any, established to secure the payment of such bonds. The bonds may be used in payment of the cost of the improvement as specified; or the governing body, upon advertisement published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in such municipality and in such other newspapers as may be designated by the governing body, may sell a sufficient number of said bonds to pay such cost in cash for the best bid submitted in accordance with the terms of the notice of sale. All bids may be rejected at the discretion of the governing body. In addition, the bonds may be sold on such terms and conditions at a private sale if determined by the governing body to be in the best interests of the municipality.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a25p05s31-25-534ol12">
       When all bonds of a district have been paid, any moneys remaining to the credit of such district may be transferred to a special surplus and deficiency fund, and, whenever there is a deficiency in any improvement district bond fund to meet the payment of outstanding bonds for other improvement districts and interest due thereon or to redeem such outstanding bonds in accordance with any estimated redemption schedule used in connection with the sale of such bonds, the deficiency may be paid from the moneys available therefor in the surplus and deficiency fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a25p05s31-25-534ol13">
       In connection with the issuance of bonds payable solely from special assessments, the governing body of the municipality may provide by ordinance or resolution for the submission of the question of issuing such bonds to the electors eligible to vote on the question. The governing body of the municipality may provide by ordinance or resolution that all registered electors of the municipality shall be eligible to vote on the question or that only electors of the district shall be eligible to vote on the question.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a25p05s31-25-534ol14">
       In connection with the issuance of bonds payable from special assessments which are additionally secured by a pledge of any other funds of the municipality, including the surplus and deficiency fund, the governing body of the municipality may provide by ordinance or resolution for the submission of the question of issuing the bonds to all registered electors of the municipality.

      <li id="t31a25p05s31-25-534ol15">
       Notwithstanding any other provision of this part 5, bonds issued in accordance with the requirements of this section may be payable from the assessments levied in one or more improvement districts.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this part 5, any district formed for the purpose of encouraging, accommodating, and financing improvements as authorized in section 31-25-502 (2) may be authorized to issue one or more series of bonds, and bonds of any such district may be payable from the assessments levied pursuant to one or more assessment ordinances.

       31-25-537. When mandamus will issue.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When any improvement authorized by this part 5 is petitioned for by the owners of property to be assessed for more than one-half of the entire costs estimated by the governing body to be assessed, it is the duty of the municipal officials whose duty it is to act to authorize said improvement, and an order in the nature of mandamus may issue out of any court of competent jurisdiction requiring said officials to take such action as is required by this part 5; but, if the material petitioned for is known to be worthless or of poor quality or would not make a good, substantial, and reasonable permanent improvement, the governing body may refuse to grant a petition for that reason. If a material petitioned for or designated in the specifications is a patented or proprietary article on which there can be but one bid, the governing body may refuse to award a contract if the entire bid is excessive as compared with improvements of equal value or may reject the bid or readvertise.

       Since § 31-25-538 is similar to former § 31-25-539 prior to the 1975 repeal and reenactment of this title, and laws antecedent thereto, a relevant case construing a prior provision has been included in the annotations to this section.

        Time limitations for attacking assessments.
       </b>
       Reasonable limitations regarding the time within which actions can be commenced attacking the validity of special assessments for public improvements are necessary. To meet the expenses of such improvements bonds must be negotiated, and unless there is some reasonable limit within which actions may be commenced to attack assessments levied for the purpose of liquidating such bonds when they mature, they could not be disposed of advantageously because parties purchasing would never know when an action might be commenced by some dissatisfied taxpayer; and on the other hand, after the lapse of the statutory period they would have the right to presume no such actions could be maintained, and their rights ought to be protected by a statute which fixes a time within which suits must be commenced, unless it is apparent that thereby some constitutional right of the taxpayer has been denied or invaded.

The warrants may be issued to a contractor to apply at par value on the contract price for the improvements or to the owner of the property to apply at par value on the property price. The warrants may also be issued and sold at not less than par value in such manner as the governing body may determine, and the proceeds may be used to apply towards payment of the contract price and property price. Interim warrants shall bear interest from date of issue until paid at such rate as may be fixed by the governing body. Interest accruing on interim warrants shall be included as a cost of the improvements in the local improvement district. Interim warrants and interest thereon shall be paid by the issuance of or by proceeds from the sale of special improvement bonds issued or in cash received from the payment of assessments not pledged to the payment of the bonds or from any of such sources.

       To carry out the purposes of this part 6, the board is hereby authorized pursuant to a duly adopted ordinance to issue bonds of the district. Such bonds shall bear interest at a rate such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds does not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate authorized, payable at such times as determined by the board, and shall be due and payable in installments at such times as determined by the board extending not more than twenty years from date of issuance. The form and terms of said bonds, including provisions for their sale, payment, and redemption, shall be determined by the board. To the extent required by section 20 of article X of the Colorado constitution, such bonds shall not be issued unless first approved at an election held for that purpose in accordance with articles 1 to 13 of title 1, C.R.S., or article 10 of this title. If the board so determines, such bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity, with or without payment of a premium, but no premium shall exceed three percent of the principal thereof. The bonds shall be executed in the name of and on behalf of the district and signed by the presiding officer of the board with the seal of the district affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the board. Such bonds shall be in such denominations as the board shall determine. Interest coupons, if any, shall bear the original or facsimile signature of the presiding officer of the board. Under no circumstances shall any of said bonds be held to be an indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the municipalities or counties in which the district is located, and bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part 6 shall contain a statement to that effect.

     <p>
      Any district organized pursuant to this part 6 may be dissolved after notice is given and a hearing held in the manner prescribed by sections 31-25-606 and 31-25-607. After hearing any protests against or objections to dissolution, if the board determines that it is for the best interests of all concerned to dissolve the district, it shall so provide by an effective ordinance, a certified copy of which shall be filed in the office of the county clerk and recorder in each of the counties in which the district or part thereof is located. Upon such filing, the dissolution shall be complete. However, no district shall be dissolved until it has satisfied or paid in full all of its outstanding indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities or until funds are on deposit and available therefor.

When the governing body or other official determines there has been such failure and neglect, a resolution reciting such determination shall be duly adopted, and a certified copy shall be served on the owner personally by any competent person over the age of eighteen years or shall be sent by registered mail to the owner's last known address.

The petition shall set forth the facts relating to the sale and ownership of such burial space as revealed by the records of said municipality and cemetery, a description of the burial space described in the same manner as such burial space is known and described on the books and records of the municipality and cemetery, and the failure and neglect to comply with the ordinances, rules, and regulations for the care and maintenance of said burial space. The petition shall ask for the forfeiture, termination, or foreclosure of all right, title, and interest of such owner in said burial space and that title thereto be vested in the municipality. The proceeding provided for in this section is deemed and held to be a proceeding in rem, and the procedure for forfeiture, termination, or foreclosure under this part 7 shall conform to the Colorado rules of civil procedure for the courts of record except as otherwise provided in this part 7. A copy of said petition with a notice of hearing thereon shall be served upon said owner in such manner and form as may be provided for the service of process by the Colorado rules of civil procedure. Thereupon it is the duty of such owner to appear and answer the allegations of said petition. If the owner fails to appear and answer on or prior to the day set for hearing, his default may be entered in the same manner as is provided by the Colorado rules of civil procedure for the entering of defaults generally.

     <p>
      With respect to property concerning which there is no appearance or concerning which all objections presented are overruled, the court shall forthwith enter a final order fixing the amount of the delinquency and costs and directing the treasurer of the taxing authority to sell such property at a date not more than ten days after the entry of such order for the purpose of satisfying the same. No proceeding to review any order of the district court entered under the provisions of this part 11 for the sale of any property shall be commenced after thirty days from the entry of the order sought to be reviewed. No proceeding to review such order shall be permitted to interrupt or delay the sale of any property with respect to which no such proceeding has been commenced. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any person in interest who has not been given actual notice. No sale shall be stayed unless the applicant for review files a bond in the supreme court in a penal sum not less than the amount of the delinquent assessment, with the condition that the amount of said tax, together with costs, shall be summarily forfeited to the taxing authority if the ruling of the trial court is sustained, in which event payment under the bond shall constitute a payment of the delinquent tax. If order of sale is denied by the district court, the taxing authorities shall have the right to a review of the proceedings in the supreme court and shall not be required to file a bond therefor.

     <p>
      No district created under the provisions of this part 12 shall issue bonds, levy taxes, fees, or assessments or provide improvements or services unless the municipality has approved an operating plan and budget for the district. The operating plan or budget shall specifically identify the services or improvements to be provided by the district, the taxes, fees, or assessments to be imposed by the district, the estimated principal amount of bonds to be issued by the district, and such additional information as the municipality may require. The district shall file an operating plan and its proposed budget for the next fiscal year with the clerk of the municipality no later than September 30 of each year. All of the business records of the district shall be considered public records, as defined in section 24-72-202 (6), C.R.S., and shall promptly be made available to the municipality upon request. For the purposes of this section, the business records of the district shall not include the business records of the owners of property in the district. The municipality may require the district to supplement the district's operating plan or budget where necessary. The municipality shall approve or disapprove the operating plan and budget within thirty days after receipt of such operating plan and budget and all requested documentation relating thereto, but not later than December 5 of the year in which such documents are filed. Thereafter, the services, improvements, and financial arrangements of the district shall conform so far as practicable to the operating plan and the budget. The operating plan and the budget may, from time to time, be amended by the district with the approval of the municipality in substantially the same manner as the process for formulating the operating plan and budget for each year. Any material departure from the operating plan and the budget, as originally approved or amended from time to time, may be enjoined by an order of the municipality filed with the board.

The resolution shall apportion the relative benefits to the real properties benefited by the service. Thereafter, the board shall cause to be prepared a local assessment roll. All assessments shall be due and payable at the time and place specified in the assessing resolution and said assessments shall become delinquent if not paid with thirty days of such due date.

As to any subsequent subdivision of any lot or tract of land assessed, the assessment may be apportioned by the board in such manner, if any, as may be provided in the assessing resolution. If any court of competent jurisdiction sets aside any assessment for irregularity in the proceedings, the board may make a new assessment in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (2). If an assessment is not paid within thirty days after its due date, penalty interest on the amount of the assessment shall accrue at the rate established pursuant to section 5-12-106 (2) and (3), C.R.S., until the date of sale or payment.

         The assessments imposed by this section shall be collected by the officer of the district designated in the assessment resolution or, by agreement with the municipality, by the municipal treasurer. In the case of a default in the payment of any assessment, the collection officer shall certify to the county treasurer the whole amount of the unpaid assessments. The county treasurer shall advertise and sell all property concerning which such a default has occurred for the payment of the whole of the unpaid assessment, plus penalties and costs of collection. Such advertisement and sale shall be made at the same times, in the same manner, under all the same conditions and penalties, and with the same effect as provided by general law for sales of real estate and default of payment of the general property tax.

      To carry out the purposes of this part 12, the board, with the approval of the municipality if the board is appointed pursuant to section 31-25-1209 (1)(b) or (1)(c), is hereby authorized to issue bonds of the district. Such bonds shall bear interest at a rate such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds does not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate authorized, payable at such times as determined by the board, and shall be due and payable in installments at such times as determined by the board extending not more than twenty years from the date of issuance. The form and terms of said bonds, including provisions for their sale, payment, and redemption, shall be determined by the board. If such bonds are payable from the general ad valorem taxes of the district, such bonds shall not be issued unless first approved at an election held pursuant to section 31-25-1222. Bonds payable solely from revenues derived from sources other than the district's general ad valorem tax may be issued without an election. If the board so determines, such bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity, with or without payment of a premium, but no premium shall exceed three percent of the principal thereof. The bonds shall be executed in the name of and on behalf of the district and signed by the presiding officer of the board with the seal of the district affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the board. Such bonds shall be in such denominations as the board shall determine. Interest coupons, if any, shall bear the original or facsimile signature of the presiding officer of the board. Under no circumstances shall any of said bonds be held to be an indebtedness, an obligation, or a liability of the municipality in which the district is located, and bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part 12 shall contain a statement to that effect.

      Any district organized pursuant to this part 12 may be dissolved after notice is given, publication is made, and a hearing is held in the manner prescribed by sections 31-25-1206 and 31-25-1207. The dissolution of the district may be initiated by filing in the office of the clerk of the governing body either a petition signed by the persons described in section 31-25-1205 (2) or, in the case of a district which has not filed an operating plan and budget as required by section 31-25-1211 for two years, a resolution of the governing body. After hearing any protests against or objections to dissolution and if the governing body determines that it is for the best interests of all concerned to dissolve the district, it shall so provide by an effective ordinance, a certified copy of which shall be filed in the office of the county clerk and recorder in each of the counties in which the district or any part thereof is located. Upon such filing, the dissolution shall be complete. However, no district shall be dissolved until it has satisfied or paid in full all of its outstanding indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities or until funds are on deposit and available therefor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, upon petition of persons who own real or personal property in the service area of the proposed district having a valuation for assessment of not less than fifty percent, or such greater amount as the governing body may provide by ordinance, of the valuation for assessment of all real and personal property in the service area of the proposed district and who own at least fifty percent, or such greater amount as the governing body may provide by ordinance, of the acreage in the proposed district, the district shall be prohibited from incurring any new or increased financial obligations, shall impose its existing taxes, fees, and assessments solely to meet any existing financial obligations, and shall be dissolved as soon as the district has no outstanding financial obligations.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that the establishment of statewide actuarial standards regarding funded and unfunded liabilities of state-assisted old hire police officers' and firefighters' pension funds established pursuant to this article is a matter of statewide concern affected with a public interest, and the provisions of this part 3 are enacted in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state. The general assembly further declares that state moneys provided to municipalities, fire protection districts, and county improvement districts do not constitute an obligation of the state to participate in the costs of pension plan benefits but are provided in recognition that said local governments are currently burdened with financial obligations relating to pensions in excess of their present financial capacities. It is the intent of the general assembly in providing state moneys to assist said local governments that state participation decrease annually, terminating at the earliest possible date.

       The language of this section grants and limits pension benefits and fixes the point of time at which the individual or class is determined a beneficiary, and it is quite clear that it is intended to cover "policemen who have been members in good standing of the police departments", and the real, significant point of time is, "the time of death or injury".

       If an old hire member of any police department in a municipality having a population of less than one hundred thousand, while in the performance of the member's duty or by reason of service in such department, becomes physically or mentally disabled and such disability is deemed to be of a temporary nature, the board of trustees shall retire the individual with a disability and shall authorize the payment to such individual, monthly, of an amount from the pension fund equal to the monthly compensation paid any such member as salary at the date of such disability, not to exceed a period of one year. For the purpose of determining the physical or mental disability of any such member, the board of trustees may personally examine the member or may appoint one or more physicians or surgeons to make an examination of the member and report their findings to the board, which report may be taken into consideration in determining whether the member has a physical or mental disability.

Such retired member is entitled to notice and to be present at the hearing of any such evidence and may be represented by counsel. The retired member shall be permitted to propound any question pertinent or relevant to such matter and shall also have the right to introduce evidence on the member's own behalf. All witnesses so produced shall be examined under oath, and any member of such board of trustees is authorized to administer such oath to such witnesses. The decision of such board shall be final.

       If any old hire member or officer of any police department in a municipality having a population of less than one hundred thousand becomes mentally or physically disabled so as to render necessary the member's retirement from service in such department, said board of trustees shall retire such member from service in such department, and the member shall receive from the pension fund an amount equal to one-half of the monthly salary received by the member at the time the member becomes so disabled. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, when any old hire member of such police department or retired old hire member dies and leaves a surviving spouse or dependent parent or children under the age of sixteen years, surviving, the board of trustees shall authorize the payment monthly from the pension fund of the sum of thirty dollars to such surviving spouse or dependent parent and six dollars to each such minor child until the child reaches the age of sixteen years. No pension shall be paid to the dependent parent of the deceased member who leaves a surviving spouse, and, if the surviving spouse of any deceased member remarries, such pension shall cease.

The member, after retirement, shall continue to accrue longevity, and the member's length of service shall continue to extend in the same manner and with the same limitations as if the member were still active and not retired. Said pension shall continue to be paid as long as the member is in retirement.

       The board shall establish such general rules as it deems proper for the purpose of reexamination of all old hire members who have been retired for disability to determine from time to time the fitness of such members to return to active duty in the department. No such member who has reached the age of fifty years, either before or after the member's retirement, shall be reexamined. No such member who has completed twenty-five years of active duty in the department before the date of such retirement shall be reexamined. No member on the retired list shall be examined sooner than one year after date of retirement and not more often than once a year thereafter. In the event it is found by the board that any old hire member on the retired list has recovered from the disability that caused the member's retirement, such member, if the member is under fifty years of age and has served less than twenty-five years of active duty, shall be removed from the retired list and ordered to report to the chief officer of the fire department within thirty days for assignment to active duty. During said period of thirty days such member may file a written protest in which the member shall state any objection that the member may have to the member's removal from the retired list. The decision of the board shall be suspended pending a hearing on said protest, at that hearing the member shall have a right to appear and to be represented by counsel. During the period that any member is ordered retired for disability by the board, such member, if under the age of fifty years and having served less than twenty-five years of active duty, shall be carried on a special roll of the fire department and listed as inactive.

       In any case where an old hire member of the fire department in a municipality having a population of at least one hundred thousand becomes mentally or physically disabled while not on active duty during regularly assigned hours of duty and from any cause not self-inflicted or due to the habitual use of intoxicants or drugs to an extent whereby the member is unable to perform the member's regular fire department duties, the member shall be paid by the board, during the period of such disability and no longer, a monthly benefit equal to five percent of the amount set forth in subsection (3) of this section multiplied by the number of years the member has been in active service with the fire department; except that any such benefit under this section shall not exceed one-half of the member's monthly salary as of the date of the member's disability. The provisions covering examinations and reexaminations, as set forth in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, shall be applicable to all cases arising under this subsection (6).

      <li id="t31a30.5p07s31-30.5-705ol17">
       If any old hire member of a fire department in a municipality having a population of at least one hundred thousand dies from any cause while in the service or while on the retired list, leaving a surviving spouse, such surviving spouse shall be awarded a monthly annuity equal to one-third of the monthly salary of such member at the time of the member's death or retirement plus one-third of any increase in salary and longevity or additional pay based on length of service granted to firefighters of the rank or comparable successor rank that the member held in the department on the date of the member's death or retirement so long as such surviving spouse remains unmarried. No dissolution of a subsequent marriage shall have the effect of reinstating said spouse on the pension roll or authorizing the granting of a pension. This section shall apply alike to surviving spouses of firefighters and retired firefighters who die after April 11, 1947, and to surviving spouses of firefighters and retired firefighters who were dead on said date, it being the intent of the general assembly to provide an annuity for all surviving spouses of firefighters, which annuity shall increase or decrease proportionately to any increase or decrease in the current rate of pay of firefighters.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a30.5p07s31-30.5-705ol18">
       The board shall also order the payment to such surviving spouse or the legally appointed guardian of each child of such deceased old hire member of the fire department a monthly annuity of thirty dollars for each child, to continue until such child reaches the age of eighteen years. If such surviving spouse dies or there is no surviving spouse as limited and described but such deceased old hire member leaves surviving children under eighteen years of age, the board shall order a monthly payment equal to the full payment to which a firefighter's surviving spouse is entitled under subsection (7) of this section to be divided equally among the children or a monthly payment of thirty dollars for each child, whichever total amount is greater, to the guardian of the children for the children. In no event shall such surviving children of a deceased or retired firefighter receive an amount in excess of one-half of the current salary paid to a firefighter, first-grade, of said department.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or the provisions of article 31 of this title that specifically refer to exempt plans, any municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district, prior to January 1, 1980, may establish an alternative police officers' or firefighters' pension benefit program or combination pension and insurance benefit program for police officers or firefighters that, if found by an actuarial study to be actuarially sound, shall be exempt from all provisions of parts 3 to 7 of this article. Such program and any amendments thereto must be approved in an election held or vote called for that purpose by at least sixty-five percent of the total votes cast by all police officers or firefighters actively employed by the municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district and all former old hire members who have earned pension rights or benefits under this article at the time the program is adopted or amended. No amendment of an exempt alternative program may be adopted that would adversely affect the accrued pension benefits of former old hire members. Once established, such exempt alternative program shall cover all police officers or firefighters employed by the municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district, regardless of the date of hire. Any municipality, fire protection district, or county improvement district having established an exempt alternative program pursuant to this section shall be entitled to receive its appropriate share of state contributions to local police officers' or firefighters' pension funds and shall file any reports required to receive such state contributions. The date limitation of January 1, 1980, established in this subsection (1) shall not be construed as limiting the ability of an employer to establish an exempt money purchase plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section and section 31-30.5-802.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly hereby declares that the establishment of police officers' and firefighters' pension plans in this state is a matter of statewide concern that affects the public safety and general welfare, that the ability of pension funds to pay earned benefits to present and future members is a necessary corollary to the establishment of pension plans, and that statewide pension plans establishing pension benefits that can be fully funded with local moneys will permit the continuation of pension plans for police officers and firefighters in this state. In addition, the general assembly declares that any pension plan must be actuarially sound in order to assure the security of the pension system and that this article is enacted to provide for the stability and security of police officers' and firefighters' pension plans in this state. The general assembly further declares that state moneys provided to municipalities, fire protection districts, and county improvement districts do not constitute a continuing obligation of the state to participate in the ongoing normal costs of pension plan benefits, except for state funding of death and disability benefits as specified in this article, but are provided in recognition that the local governments are currently burdened with financial obligations relating to pensions in excess of their present financial capacities. It is the intent of the general assembly in providing state moneys to assist the local governments that state participation decrease annually, terminating at the earliest possible date.

        Intention of general assembly in enacting plan was to preempt benefits provided under Denver city charter.
       </b>
       The payment of state plan benefits in addition to those provided by the Denver city charter would disserve the basic purpose of the legislation which is to relieve communities of the intolerable financial burdens they would otherwise face in connection with their pension plans. Peterson v. Fire and Police Pension Ass'n, 725 P.2d 81 (Colo. App. 1986).

        The Public Employee Retirement Association and the Policemen's and Firemen's Pension Reform Act statutory provisions have established a defined benefit contributory pension system
       </b>
       in which most public employees are required to participate. By making these contributions, employees obtain a limited vesting of pension rights, which ripen into vested pension rights upon attainment of the respective eligibility requirements. Colo.

        Prior to death, benefits are partially vested and may be changed.
       </b>
       Prior to a police officer's or firefighter's death, there is limited or partial vesting of survivor benefits, and, until survivor benefits fully vest, a pension plan can be changed; however any adverse change must be balanced by change that is beneficial, actuarially necessary or one that strengthens or improves pension plan. Peterson v. Fire &amp; Police Pension Ass'n, 759 P.2d 720 (Colo. 1988), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 759 P.2d 720 (Colo. 1988).

        Diminished benefits offered under state plan were offset by improved actuarial soundness and more stable funding.
       </b>
       Though adoption of state plan meant reduced benefits to persons formerly covered by Denver city pension plan, this reduction was justified by improved funding and increased chance that pension fund obligations would be fulfilled. Peterson v. Fire &amp; Police Pension Ass'n, 759 P.2d 720 (Colo. 1988).

       "Actuarially sound" means a police officers' or firefighters' pension fund determined by the board to be receiving or scheduled to receive employer and member contributions in each fiscal year equal to the annual contributions actuarially determined to be necessary to pay the annual current service cost of pension benefits attributable to active employees and to pay the annual contribution necessary to amortize any unfunded accrued liability over a period not to exceed forty years. The actuarial cost method to be utilized shall be the entry age-normal cost method. The date from which unfunded liabilities shall be amortized shall be determined pursuant to part 3 of article 30.5 of this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a31p01s31-31-102ol12">
       "Board" means the board of directors established as the governing body of the fire and police pension association as provided in section 31-31-201 (2).

       "Member" means an active employee who is a full-time salaried employee of a municipality, fire protection district, fire authority, or county improvement district normally serving at least one thousand six hundred hours in any calendar year and whose duties are directly involved with the provision of police or fire protection, as certified by the member's employer. "Member" also includes an active employee who works less than sixteen hundred hours per year but otherwise qualifies as a member and whose employer elects to treat all such other similar employees as members. The term does not include clerical or other personnel whose services are auxiliary to police protection, or any volunteer firefighter, as such term is defined in section 31-30-1102 (9). For the purpose of participation in the statewide defined benefit plan pursuant to part 4 of this article or the statewide money purchase plan pursuant to part 5 of this article, but not for the purpose of participation in the statewide death and disability plan pursuant to part 8 of this article, the term may include clerical or other personnel employed by a fire protection district, fire authority, or county improvement district, whose services are auxiliary to fire protection. For the purpose of eligibility for disability or survivor benefits, "member" includes any employee on an authorized leave of absence.
      </li>
      <li id="t31a31p01s31-31-102ol15">

       The provisions of this act indicate that the fund's administrative board may contract with carriers to provide this type of coverage.

The member contribution rate shall increase by four percent to be implemented through eight annual increases as follows: Beginning in 2015, and each year thereafter through 2022, the member contribution rate shall increase by an additional one-half of one percent of base salary until the total member contribution rate, including the cumulative contribution rate increases, is twelve percent of base salary. The payment shall be made by the employer by deduction from the salary paid such member. Each employer shall pick up the member contributions required for all salaries paid after July 1, 1985, and the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414 (h)(2) of the federal "Internal Revenue Code of 1986", as amended, in determining tax treatment under such code. The employer shall pay these member contributions directly to the retirement association, instead of paying such amounts to members, and such contributions shall be paid from the same funds that are used in paying salaries to the members. Such contributions, although designated as member contributions, shall be paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by members. Members may not elect to choose to receive such contributions directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the pension plan. Member contributions so picked up shall be treated for all purposes of this article 31, other than federal tax, in the same manner as member contributions made before the date picked up. Payment shall be made by one voucher for the aggregate amount deducted and shall be made no later than ten days following the date of payment of salary to the member.

If the board cannot so determine, it shall order that the normal retirement pension commence such number of months as are actuarially supportable, from one to sixty, after age fifty-five for members who have completed at least twenty-five years of active service and are otherwise eligible in accordance with the board's determination. The determination of the board shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. A pension commenced after age fifty-five pursuant to this subsection (1)(b) shall not be subject to annual review. If a court determines that this subsection (1)(b) is invalid, the age of retirement to be eligible for any normal retirement benefit shall be age sixty except for persons receiving a benefit at the time of the court's decision.

      If, subsequent to disability benefits being awarded to a member pursuant to the provisions of section 31-31-803 or 31-31-806.5, but prior to a decision of the board that an occupational disability ceases to exist pursuant to section 31-31-805 (2), a member is employed or reemployed in this state or any other jurisdiction, pursuant to either an agreement or court order, in a full-time salaried position that normally involves working at least one thousand six hundred hours in any given calendar year and the duties of which are directly involved with the provision of police or fire protection as determined by the board, the benefits provided pursuant to section 31-31-803 shall be discontinued. Any application for retirement for disability made by the member after such appointment or reinstatement shall be treated in all respects as a new application. The five-year limitation on investigations contained in section 31-31-803 (4)(b) shall not be applicable to the enforcement of this section.

         The expenses of the money purchase component of the plan must first be paid from forfeitures, penalties received, settlement proceeds, and other sources of revenue received, and then must be allocated to and deducted from the members' accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any revenue credits derived from the investments offered by the money purchase component may instead be distributed to participants. Expenses that are incurred as a direct result of the investments held in the money purchase component account must be deducted from the interest, dividends, and net income of the appropriate investment. General expenses must be deducted from the accounts of each member according to the member's time-weighted pro-rata share of the money purchase component account. The board may also assess a record keeping fee and an administrative fee for costs associated with the administration of the money purchase component.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Also, the plan ordinance must specify the exact amount to be paid,
       </b>
       or the exact amount of the total obligation to be incurred, or the exact amount of the interest the obligations were to bear or fall far short of the statutory requirement. Citizens Util. Co. v. City of Rocky Ford, 132 Colo. 427, 289 P.2d 165 (1955).
      </p>

       <b>
        Under this section, it is sufficient if the ordinance is adopted by a majority of the qualified electors

       voting and it is not necessary that it be adopted by a majority of all the qualified electors in the city. Weybright v. Klein, 104 Colo. 590, 92 P.2d 734 (1939).

        This section recognizes the power of home rule cities
       </b>
       to provide by charter the methods for acquiring or constructing light and power plants. It lays down the plan to be followed even by home rule cities "unless otherwise provided by the charter of such city or town". A recognition of the fact that they may so provide is an acknowledgment that they possess the power to do so. Cook v. City of Delta, 100 Colo. 7, 64 P.2d 1257 (1937).

       </b>
       This section provides that no public utility shall be acquired by any city until the plan for such acquisition shall have been adopted by ordinance, approved by a majority of the qualified property electors. The ordinance shall describe the property to be acquired, the full purchase price to be paid, the method of payment, and the total obligation to be incurred, whether by way of general obligation bonds or by way of obligations chargeable solely or in part against the income of such utility. It would seem that the general assembly intended this section to apply to a situation where so-called revenue bonds are provided for. Colo. Cent. Power Co. v. Municipal Power Dev. Co., 1 F.

The obligations of a municipality under such contracts or agreements shall either constitute special obligations of the municipality, payable solely from the revenues and other moneys derived by the municipality from its water facilities, sewerage facilities, or both, and shall be treated as expenses of operating such facilities or, in the discretion of such municipality and subject to satisfaction of any requirements of law governing or limiting the incurrence of debt by such municipality, shall constitute a general obligation of such municipality.
